However, at a bog in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario Canada, scientists have found many pitcher plants with a more ambitious diet. Nearly 20 percent of the carnivorous plants were eating spotted salamanders. It was previously considered a rare phenomenon for these plants to regularly consume vertebrates. This study suggests otherwise. It's possible the salamanders provide an extra boost of nutrients as cold settles in. Scientists speculate that the acidity of the pitcher fluid could kill them or they might get cooked in it when it's heated up by the sun. Spotted salamanders are listed as \"of least concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List.\n\nRead more in \"Carnivorous plants eat far more salamanders than scientists thought\"\nhttps://on.natgeo.com/2F7rtLx\n\nThese Plants Eat Salamanders | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/VHAD38kbcR8\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",

However, at a bog in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario Canada, scientists have found many pitcher plants with a more ambitious diet. Nearly 20 percent of the carnivorous plants were eating spotted salamanders. It was previously considered a rare phenomenon for these plants to regularly consume vertebrates. This study suggests otherwise. It's possible the salamanders provide an extra boost of nutrients as cold settles in. Scientists speculate that the acidity of the pitcher fluid could kill them or they might get cooked in it when it's heated up by the sun. Spotted salamanders are listed as \"of least concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List.\n\nRead more in \"Carnivorous plants eat far more salamanders than scientists thought\"\nhttps://on.natgeo.com/2F7rtLx\n\nThese Plants Eat Salamanders | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/VHAD38kbcR8\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

Living at the ends of the world's loneliest roads and subsisting off the rugged Alaskan bush, they battle whiteout snow storms, man-eating carnivores, questionable frozen terrain, and limited resources through a long and bitter winter. Some of them are lone wolves; others have their families beside them. All must overcome despairing odds to brave the wild and survive through to the spring. And when spring arrives in Alaska, rising temperatures bring mounting challenges as they work to prepare for yet another winter.\n\nGet More Life Below Zero:\nOfficial Site: https://on.natgeo.com/2kgvtSK\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroTwitter\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Upon closer inspection, the divers discovered that it was an eight-meter long, translucent sea \u201cworm.\u201d It\u2019s called a pyrosome, and it is a free-flowing colony of individual organisms called zooids. Zooids are small multicellular organisms that filter feed by pumping water through their bodies and catching plankton. The pyrosome can be as small as a centimeter or as big as the one in this video. At night, they swim up to the surface to feed, and when the sun comes up, they dive back into the depths.\n\nRead \"See the giant \u2018sea worm\u2019 filmed off the coast of New Zealand\"\nhttps://on.natgeo.com/2BRuGNH\n\nMysterious Sea 'Worm' Spotted Near New Zealand | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/DZkzuEqqhVI\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",

Upon closer inspection, the divers discovered that it was an eight-meter long, translucent sea \u201cworm.\u201d It\u2019s called a pyrosome, and it is a free-flowing colony of individual organisms called zooids. Zooids are small multicellular organisms that filter feed by pumping water through their bodies and catching plankton. The pyrosome can be as small as a centimeter or as big as the one in this video. At night, they swim up to the surface to feed, and when the sun comes up, they dive back into the depths.\n\nRead \"See the giant \u2018sea worm\u2019 filmed off the coast of New Zealand\"\nhttps://on.natgeo.com/2BRuGNH\n\nMysterious Sea 'Worm' Spotted Near New Zealand | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/DZkzuEqqhVI\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

National Geographic photographer Tim Laman teamed up with Rangkong Indonesia and spent months in the field just to get a glimpse of the extremely rare bird. The helmeted hornbill is one of 57 hornbill species in Africa and Asia. It\u2019s found only in the lowland forests of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and southern Thailand. The helmeted hornbill stands apart from the other hornbills because its casque\u2014the horny helmet above its beak\u2014is mostly solid with a thick layer of keratin. But that unique trait might also be the birds' undoing.

National Geographic photographer Tim Laman teamed up with Rangkong Indonesia and spent months in the field just to get a glimpse of the extremely rare bird. The helmeted hornbill is one of 57 hornbill species in Africa and Asia. It\u2019s found only in the lowland forests of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and southern Thailand. The helmeted hornbill stands apart from the other hornbills because its casque\u2014the horny helmet above its beak\u2014is mostly solid with a thick layer of keratin. But that unique trait might also be the birds' undoing. Softer than ivory and easily carved, hornbill casques are in high demand in Asia, to be fashioned into beads, pendants, and intricate works of art. Illegal poaching has caused this bird to be on the critically endangered list.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\n#NationalGeographic #HelmetedHornbill #EndangeredSpecies\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Now, as a result of mobile technology, there is no need for young people to stay overnight in personal huts, as they may have done in previous generations. Cell phones are making it faster and simpler to communicate with potential love interests, which is changing the dynamics of dating.

Now, as a result of mobile technology, there is no need for young people to stay overnight in personal huts, as they may have done in previous generations. Cell phones are making it faster and simpler to communicate with potential love interests, which is changing the dynamics of dating. Filmmaker Charlotte Pert shares one young couple's story in this fascinating short about the evolution of courtship in Cambodia.\n\nSee Charlotte's photo essay Calling for Love\nhttps://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2018/03/09/calling-for-love-a-modern-romance-in-cambodia/\n\nFollow Charlotte:\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/charlottepert\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw_0yBQrEdVdcXv8svm5lXg?view_as=subscriber\nInstagram: @charleypert\nhttps://untoldcambodia.com/\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

In late July, 2015, they were traveling through Hinlopen Strait, west of the largest island, Spitsbergen\u2014an impossible route some summers, when pack ice blocks passage. But that summer, ice was especially sparse, making hunting harder for polar bears. These apex predators favor waiting at the sea ice\u2019s edge, striking seals as they approach. A few days earlier, the Wilkinson family had been farther north,\u00a0near\u00a0the ice. There, bears looked healthy. But the scene just after midnight on July 23 was desperate. Mother and cub were struggling, skin hanging loose. According to Jon Aars, of the Norwegian Polar Institute, the cub, seven or eight months old, was likely to die if its mother didn\u2019t eat soon. She probably wasn\u2019t lactating. Wilkinson saw the bear sniff the air, picking up something of interest. This thin female couldn\u2019t attack a healthy, full-grown walrus. A carcass would solve their problem. If the walrus were weak or sick, predation might be an option. But that walrus was alive and well. The situation was unworkable. The search for food went on.\n\nRead more about the polar bear and walrus, \"Desperate for Food, Polar Bear Tests Walrus\"\nhttp://bit.ly/2E8kOCl\n\nMother Polar Bear, Desperate for Food, Tests Walrus | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/FAHA6M7xT5M\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",

In late July, 2015, they were traveling through Hinlopen Strait, west of the largest island, Spitsbergen\u2014an impossible route some summers, when pack ice blocks passage. But that summer, ice was especially sparse, making hunting harder for polar bears. These apex predators favor waiting at the sea ice\u2019s edge, striking seals as they approach. A few days earlier, the Wilkinson family had been farther north,\u00a0near\u00a0the ice. There, bears looked healthy. But the scene just after midnight on July 23 was desperate. Mother and cub were struggling, skin hanging loose. According to Jon Aars, of the Norwegian Polar Institute, the cub, seven or eight months old, was likely to die if its mother didn\u2019t eat soon. She probably wasn\u2019t lactating. Wilkinson saw the bear sniff the air, picking up something of interest. This thin female couldn\u2019t attack a healthy, full-grown walrus. A carcass would solve their problem. If the walrus were weak or sick, predation might be an option. But that walrus was alive and well. The situation was unworkable. The search for food went on.\n\nRead more about the polar bear and walrus, \"Desperate for Food, Polar Bear Tests Walrus\"\nhttp://bit.ly/2E8kOCl\n\nMother Polar Bear, Desperate for Food, Tests Walrus | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/FAHA6M7xT5M\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

Some links in that network, once unknown, have now come into view.\nWhen preyed upon, gelatinous animals, like jellyfish and comb jellies, quickly become unrecognizable, and so are undercounted in predators\u2019 guts. Plus, jellies are hard to catch with a net. But with remote-operated vehicles, MBARI researchers have been filming ocean life\u2014including jellies\u2014for decades. By reviewing their footage, MBARI has changed the model of the deep-sea ecosystem. They've found that jelly-like animals play a bigger role than previously thought. Jellies served as a food source for several types of sea creatures, and also preyed upon a number of species, such as squid. The food web just got a little more tangled.\n\nREAD: See the Hidden Eating Habits of Deep-Sea Creatures\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/deep-sea-food-web-study-underwater-vehicles-video-spd/\n\nSee Secret Eating Habits of Deep-Sea Dwellers | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/vCBP25B7hAc\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",

Some links in that network, once unknown, have now come into view.\nWhen preyed upon, gelatinous animals, like jellyfish and comb jellies, quickly become unrecognizable, and so are undercounted in predators\u2019 guts. Plus, jellies are hard to catch with a net. But with remote-operated vehicles, MBARI researchers have been filming ocean life\u2014including jellies\u2014for decades. By reviewing their footage, MBARI has changed the model of the deep-sea ecosystem. They've found that jelly-like animals play a bigger role than previously thought. Jellies served as a food source for several types of sea creatures, and also preyed upon a number of species, such as squid. The food web just got a little more tangled.\n\nREAD: See the Hidden Eating Habits of Deep-Sea Creatures\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/deep-sea-food-web-study-underwater-vehicles-video-spd/\n\nSee Secret Eating Habits of Deep-Sea Dwellers | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/vCBP25B7hAc\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

At the root of his quest is a drive to uncover the fundamental forces that keep our societies together, while revealing the common humanity that lies inside each one of us. Vast in his scope of inquiry yet with an intimate approach to each subject, Freeman meets people from all over the globe to explore the strength of belief, the thirst for power, how love shapes us, the role conflict plays in our lives, the spirit of rebellion and the concept of freedom.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

At a time when events seem to be driving cultures apart and splintering our own, Morgan Freeman goes on a global journey to understand how human culture has taken so many remarkable forms. At the root of his quest is a drive to uncover the fundamental forces that keep our societies together, while revealing the common humanity that lies inside each one of us. Vast in his scope of inquiry yet with an intimate approach to each subject, Freeman meets people from all over the globe to explore the strength of belief, the thirst for power, how love shapes us, the role conflict plays in our lives, the spirit of rebellion and the concept of freedom.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Researchers from UC Berkeley and the Netherlands' Wageningen University observed super-slow motion footage that provided details in the body movements of mosquitoes, along with similarly-sized fruit flies. Mosquitoes start flapping very slightly sooner than do fruit flies, and at a faster rate. Most of their power for lift-off is therefore coming from their wings. Fruit flies, in contrast, push off more forcefully than mosquitoes with their legs. An animal providing a blood meal is less likely to notice a mosquito's takeoff. That gives extra time for a getaway before a host can swat it down.\n\nREAD: How Mosquitoes Use Stealth to Steal Your Blood\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/mosquitoes-stealth-blood-flying-disease-spd/\n\nSee How Mosquitoes Use Stealth to Steal Your Blood | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/xc4kULKtVFo\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",

The auction follows South Africa's recent legalization of rhino horn sales. On Hume's farm, workers regularly trim the rhinos' horns to ward off poachers who seek to sell the valuable material to Asian markets. Rhinos can survive without their horns, which grow back. Hume argues that the auction will reduce poaching, while many conservationists say that legal sales of rhino horn will increase demand.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

It closes its eyes and uses its flipper as a shield from the jellyfish\u2019s stinging tentacles. Green sea turtles are endangered. Their main threat is overexploitation of eggs from the beaches they are laid on. Green sea turtles are predominately herbivorous, but juveniles have been known to feed on jellyfish.\n\nClick here to read more about the sea turtle and the jellyfish.\nhttps://bit.ly/2YI7xGv\n\nSee a Sea Turtle Devour a Jellyfish Like Spaghetti | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/PA66nEJYaAU\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",

Rangers and guides searched for eight to ten hours per day for a week, and after nine days in the jungle, Maykool was found less than a mile from the campground. He was dehydrated, and had bug bites, botflies, and spines stuck in his skin. He says a group of monkeys dropped fruit and led him to shelter and water every day.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Rangers and guides searched for eight to ten hours per day for a week, and after nine days in the jungle, Maykool was found less than a mile from the campground. He was dehydrated, and had bug bites, botflies, and spines stuck in his skin. He says a group of monkeys dropped fruit and led him to shelter and water every day.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

But this is the first time a male monkey has been observed attempting to mate with a female deer. In fact, it's only the second sexual encounter ever reported between two species that are not closely related, the other being between Antarctic fur seals and king penguins. While it could be a case of mistaken identity or a way for the monkey to learn to copulate, scientists believe the most likely explanation is that the male monkey in the video is a \"peripheral male.\" These males are low-ranking member of macaque society that do not typically have access to females to mate with, thus the encounter may have been a way for the monkey to relieve sexual frustration.\n\nRead more in \"Monkey Tries to Mate With Deer in First Ever Video\"\nhttps://bit.ly/2JcKHAM\n\nVideo courtesy Alexandre Bonnefoy\n\nFilmed during the creation of the book Saru - Singes du Japon [Saru - Monkeys of Japan]: http://www.issekinicho.fr/editions/produit/saru/\n\nPublisher: Editions Issekinicho\nAuthors: Alexandre Bonnefoy, C\u00e9dric Sueur, Marie Pel\u00e9\n\nMonkey Tries to Mate With Deer (Rare Interspecies Behavior) | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/SICLBlHizUY\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",

But this is the first time a male monkey has been observed attempting to mate with a female deer. In fact, it's only the second sexual encounter ever reported between two species that are not closely related, the other being between Antarctic fur seals and king penguins. While it could be a case of mistaken identity or a way for the monkey to learn to copulate, scientists believe the most likely explanation is that the male monkey in the video is a \"peripheral male.\" These males are low-ranking member of macaque society that do not typically have access to females to mate with, thus the encounter may have been a way for the monkey to relieve sexual frustration.\n\nRead more in \"Monkey Tries to Mate With Deer in First Ever Video\"\nhttps://bit.ly/2JcKHAM\n\nVideo courtesy Alexandre Bonnefoy\n\nFilmed during the creation of the book Saru - Singes du Japon [Saru - Monkeys of Japan]: http://www.issekinicho.fr/editions/produit/saru/\n\nPublisher: Editions Issekinicho\nAuthors: Alexandre Bonnefoy, C\u00e9dric Sueur, Marie Pel\u00e9\n\nMonkey Tries to Mate With Deer (Rare Interspecies Behavior) | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/SICLBlHizUY\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

Located in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, the tomb has been covered by marble cladding since at least 1555 A.D., and most likely centuries earlier.\n\nThis burial shelf is now enclosed by a small structure known as the Edicule (from the Latin aedicule, or \"little house\"), which was last reconstructed in 1808-1810 after being destroyed in a fire. The Edicule and the interior tomb are currently undergoing restoration by a team of scientists from the National Technical University of Athens, under the direction of Chief Scientific Supervisor Professor Antonia Moropoulou.\n\nThe National Geographic Society, with the blessing of the Greek Patriarch of Jerusalem and the other religious communities, formed a strategic alliance with the National Technical University of Athens for cultural heritage preservation. For an exclusive look at the restoration project, watch Explorer on National Geographic Channel, coming in November.\n\nRead more: Exclusive: Christ's Burial Place Exposed for First Time in Centuries\nhttp://http//news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/jesus-tomb-opened-church-holy-sepulchre/\n\nEXCLUSIVE: First Look Inside Christ's Burial Place in Centuries | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/0JolKLR6Lgo\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",

Located in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, the tomb has been covered by marble cladding since at least 1555 A.D., and most likely centuries earlier.\n\nThis burial shelf is now enclosed by a small structure known as the Edicule (from the Latin aedicule, or \"little house\"), which was last reconstructed in 1808-1810 after being destroyed in a fire. The Edicule and the interior tomb are currently undergoing restoration by a team of scientists from the National Technical University of Athens, under the direction of Chief Scientific Supervisor Professor Antonia Moropoulou.\n\nThe National Geographic Society, with the blessing of the Greek Patriarch of Jerusalem and the other religious communities, formed a strategic alliance with the National Technical University of Athens for cultural heritage preservation. For an exclusive look at the restoration project, watch Explorer on National Geographic Channel, coming in November.\n\nRead more: Exclusive: Christ's Burial Place Exposed for First Time in Centuries\nhttp://http//news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/jesus-tomb-opened-church-holy-sepulchre/\n\nEXCLUSIVE: First Look Inside Christ's Burial Place in Centuries | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/0JolKLR6Lgo\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

                "description": "These horses aren't taking a dip in the water just to cool off in the sweltering Virginia summer. They're the famous Chincoteague ponies of Assateague Island, and they're herded across the channel to Chincoteague Island every July by \"saltwater cowboys.\" Most of the foals are auctioned off the next day to raise money for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company, which owns and manages the herd under a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A few foals designated as \"buybacks\" are donated to the fire company and returned to Assateague Island to replenish the herd and live in the wild for another year. The auction also helps maintain the feral horse population at around 150 on the Virginia side of Assateague Island.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

                    "description": "These horses aren't taking a dip in the water just to cool off in the sweltering Virginia summer. They're the famous Chincoteague ponies of Assateague Island, and they're herded across the channel to Chincoteague Island every July by \"saltwater cowboys.\" Most of the foals are auctioned off the next day to raise money for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company, which owns and manages the herd under a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A few foals designated as \"buybacks\" are donated to the fire company and returned to Assateague Island to replenish the herd and live in the wild for another year. The auction also helps maintain the feral horse population at around 150 on the Virginia side of Assateague Island.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

                "description": "Now you can do your part to fight the invasive lionfish\u2014by ordering a delectable dish from a dinner menu. Divers and chefs are promoting a gastronomical way to control the venomous lionfish population in Florida's coastal waters by introducing the invasive species to the American palate. The non-native lionfish lacks natural predators and is harming native wildlife and habitat. But Pot Roast & Pinot in Pensacola, Florida, is just one restaurant that has found the fish to be tasty enough to add to its menu. The restaurant has partnered with licensed harvesters who can capture hundreds of pounds of lionfish in one dive. The hope is to create a viable commercial industry and save Florida's marine environment by eradicating the lionfish population one bite at a time.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

                    "description": "Now you can do your part to fight the invasive lionfish\u2014by ordering a delectable dish from a dinner menu. Divers and chefs are promoting a gastronomical way to control the venomous lionfish population in Florida's coastal waters by introducing the invasive species to the American palate. The non-native lionfish lacks natural predators and is harming native wildlife and habitat. But Pot Roast & Pinot in Pensacola, Florida, is just one restaurant that has found the fish to be tasty enough to add to its menu. The restaurant has partnered with licensed harvesters who can capture hundreds of pounds of lionfish in one dive. The hope is to create a viable commercial industry and save Florida's marine environment by eradicating the lionfish population one bite at a time.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

                "description": "Venomous lionfish, native to parts of the Indian and South Pacific Oceans, have now taken up residence in southeastern waters of the United States and in the Caribbean. With the ability to reproduce quickly and eat just about anything half their size, and with no natural predators in the Atlantic to help keep their population in check, these fish are posing a serious threat to our reefs and native fish populations. Concerned about the impact of lionfish on reefs in the Atlantic, National Geographic Young Explorer Erin Spencer traveled to Florida to see how communities are banding together to remove these fish from their waters. Luckily, lionfish are edible and delicious, making them one of the most sustainable and environmentally friendly fish to eat. So kick back with a plate of lionfish sushi and know you are helping to sustain Atlantic coral reefs at the same time. \n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\u27a1 Get More Nat Geo Live: http://bit.ly/MoreNatGeoLive\n\nAbout Nat Geo Live (National Geographic Live):\nThought-provoking presentations by today's leading explorers, scientists, and photographers.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

                    "description": "Venomous lionfish, native to parts of the Indian and South Pacific Oceans, have now taken up residence in southeastern waters of the United States and in the Caribbean. With the ability to reproduce quickly and eat just about anything half their size, and with no natural predators in the Atlantic to help keep their population in check, these fish are posing a serious threat to our reefs and native fish populations. Concerned about the impact of lionfish on reefs in the Atlantic, National Geographic Young Explorer Erin Spencer traveled to Florida to see how communities are banding together to remove these fish from their waters. Luckily, lionfish are edible and delicious, making them one of the most sustainable and environmentally friendly fish to eat. So kick back with a plate of lionfish sushi and know you are helping to sustain Atlantic coral reefs at the same time. \n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\u27a1 Get More Nat Geo Live: http://bit.ly/MoreNatGeoLive\n\nAbout Nat Geo Live (National Geographic Live):\nThought-provoking presentations by today's leading explorers, scientists, and photographers.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

That\u2019s enough food to feed the nearly 800 million people going hungry and then some. Household and grocery waste are two of the biggest reasons for the problem. However, one of the biggest culprits is the casting off of so-called \u201cugly\u201d foods.  \n \nAt your local market, perfectly formed, beautifully colored fruits and vegetables surround shoppers. Sure, they exist, but these foods are the supermodels of the agricultural world. Most fruits and vegetables come in a variety of shapes and sizes, which are cosmetically far removed from what you find on grocery shelves. As a result of our expectations, perfectly good food regularly goes to waste. \n \nIn this week\u2019s Today I Learned, National Geographic explorer Tristram Stuart elaborates on the many ways perfectly good food goes to waste.

                    "description": "When you were a kid, your mom probably made you stay at the dinner table until you finished your peas. Most of us eventually gave in, swallowing the evil little green bits like pills with milk. It was torture at the time, but mom had the right idea\u2014and not just because peas are good for you. \n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\u27a1 Watch All Today I Learned Clips here: http://bit.ly/2WatchTodayILearned\n\u27a1 Get More TIL (Today I Learned): http://bit.ly/MoreTIL\n\nAbout TIL (Today I Learned):\nLove crazy facts?

That\u2019s enough food to feed the nearly 800 million people going hungry and then some. Household and grocery waste are two of the biggest reasons for the problem. However, one of the biggest culprits is the casting off of so-called \u201cugly\u201d foods.  \n \nAt your local market, perfectly formed, beautifully colored fruits and vegetables surround shoppers. Sure, they exist, but these foods are the supermodels of the agricultural world. Most fruits and vegetables come in a variety of shapes and sizes, which are cosmetically far removed from what you find on grocery shelves. As a result of our expectations, perfectly good food regularly goes to waste. \n \nIn this week\u2019s Today I Learned, National Geographic explorer Tristram Stuart elaborates on the many ways perfectly good food goes to waste. To learn more about the problem check out the March 2016 issue of National Geographic magazine: http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/03/global-food-waste-statistics/\n\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\nEDITOR: Chris Mattle\nCAMERA: Carolyn Barnwell\n\nTIL: We Waste One-Third of Food Worldwide | Today I Learned\nhttps://youtu.be/qJJ1IVZE67k\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

Although trash heaps are easier to spot in waterways, microplastics\u2014pieces of plastic smaller than five millimeters\u2014have started to stir more concern. Acting as sponges, the pieces soak up the chemicals around them and often make their way through the food chain, ending up on dinner plates. Most microplastics are created over time from larger pieces or directly from microbeads in products like face washes or toothpaste. The pieces are so small they pass through waste treatment plants and into waterways.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

                    "description": "You might not be able to see them, but they're in the water. Although trash heaps are easier to spot in waterways, microplastics\u2014pieces of plastic smaller than five millimeters\u2014have started to stir more concern. Acting as sponges, the pieces soak up the chemicals around them and often make their way through the food chain, ending up on dinner plates. Most microplastics are created over time from larger pieces or directly from microbeads in products like face washes or toothpaste. The pieces are so small they pass through waste treatment plants and into waterways.\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Living at the ends of the world's loneliest roads and subsisting off the rugged Alaskan bush, they battle whiteout snow storms, man-eating carnivores, questionable frozen terrain, and limited resources through a long and bitter winter. Some of them are lone wolves; others have their families beside them. All must overcome despairing odds to brave the wild and survive through to the spring. And when spring arrives in Alaska, rising temperatures bring mounting challenges as they work to prepare for yet another winter.\n\nGet More Life Below Zero:\nOfficial Site: https://on.natgeo.com/2kgvtSK\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroTwitter\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Living at the ends of the world's loneliest roads and subsisting off the rugged Alaskan bush, they battle whiteout snow storms, man-eating carnivores, questionable frozen terrain, and limited resources through a long and bitter winter. Some of them are lone wolves; others have their families beside them. All must overcome despairing odds to brave the wild and survive through to the spring. And when spring arrives in Alaska, rising temperatures bring mounting challenges as they work to prepare for yet another winter.\n\nGet More Life Below Zero:\nOfficial Site: https://on.natgeo.com/2kgvtSK\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroTwitter\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Living at the ends of the world's loneliest roads and subsisting off the rugged Alaskan bush, they battle whiteout snow storms, man-eating carnivores, questionable frozen terrain, and limited resources through a long and bitter winter. Some of them are lone wolves; others have their families beside them. All must overcome despairing odds to brave the wild and survive through to the spring. And when spring arrives in Alaska, rising temperatures bring mounting challenges as they work to prepare for yet another winter.\n\nGet More Life Below Zero:\nOfficial Site: https://on.natgeo.com/2kgvtSK\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroTwitter\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Living at the ends of the world's loneliest roads and subsisting off the rugged Alaskan bush, they battle whiteout snow storms, man-eating carnivores, questionable frozen terrain, and limited resources through a long and bitter winter. Some of them are lone wolves; others have their families beside them. All must overcome despairing odds to brave the wild and survive through to the spring.

Living at the ends of the world's loneliest roads and subsisting off the rugged Alaskan bush, they battle whiteout snow storms, man-eating carnivores, questionable frozen terrain, and limited resources through a long and bitter winter. Some of them are lone wolves; others have their families beside them. All must overcome despairing odds to brave the wild and survive through to the spring. And when spring arrives in Alaska, rising temperatures bring mounting challenges as they work to prepare for yet another winter.\n\nGet More Life Below Zero:\nOfficial Site: https://on.natgeo.com/2kgvtSK\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/LifeBelowZeroTwitter\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.
