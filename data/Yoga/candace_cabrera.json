Join here: https://intentionfactor.com/memberships-online-classes\n\nPosture - Best place to go to set a solid foundation, this programming focuses on posterior chain strength, core integration (with pelvic floor education) and mindfulness/postural awareness. You'll also learn how to assess your own posture! Ideal for people who are either brand new to working out, or people who have worked out for ages but keep finding themselves continually injured.\n\nGlute: Ideal for people needing a complement to their current workouts, or for someone who has \"graduated\" from the Posture Program, or for someone who is solely interested in aesthetics and looking for glute gains.\n\nFitness: This is a comprehensive workout program that includes cardio as well. Best for people who know their way around a gym and who are currently pain free, and who have either plateaued in their training, are bored, or just want a plan, and don't want to have to think about it.\n\nWorking out with your Cycle: For people with regular cycles (it's beyond my scope of practice to help you re-gain your cycle, or help balance hormones - that's the job of a dr), and who want to optimize their training around their cycle. You'll get a high level overview of the four different phases of a cycle, figure out where you are in your cycle, and choose workouts tailored to the cycle you're in. \n\nJoin now: https://intentionfactor.com/memberships-online-classes",

                "description": "It's that time of year again! Time to unveil our latest Mantra Box\u00ae: Intentional Summer. Inspired by my hiking trip to Peru where I hiked the Salkantay Trek (you can read about it here: https://www.yogabycandace.com/blog/2021/7/11/my-experience-hiking-the-salkantay-trek-to-machu-picchu), I wanted to fill this quarter's Mantra Box\u00ae with items to help inspire you to get outside, have adventure, and do something that brings you joy. \n\nYou can check out the blog post here with all the details:\nOr if you're ready to order now, you can do so here: https://www.yogabycandace.com/ybc-mantra-box/intentional-summer-mantra-box\n\nAll the details: \nOrganiLip (https://www.organilip.com/) - $4 - @organilip - OrganiLip ultra-rich lip balm is infused with 100% pure organic Sea Buckthorn berry oil to moisturize and rejuvenate the most delicate skin on your body. Blended with soothing calendula and nourishing organic coconut oil, OrganiLip is made from only pure, organic ingredients that are fair trade certified. Their products never contain petroleum or palm oil and are 100% cruelty free.\n\nCrushed Tonic (https://www.crushedtonic.com/collections/crushed-tonic/products/sampler) - $7.50 - @crushedtonic - Crushed Tonic has designed a wonder-product for hair, skin and nails. You\u2019ll get an Original Crush with marine collagen, biotin, probiotics and lucuma. This is perfect if you\u2019re a coffee drinker. Just add the Original Crush right to your cup of joe. Hate coffee but still crave caffeine? You\u2019ll also get the  Matcha Crush which has marine collagen, biotin, probiotics and match!\n\nPlantFusion Complete Protein in Red Velvet (https://plantfusion.com/products/complete-plant-protein) - $4.99 - @plantfusion - There\u2019s a reason why most protein shakes look and taste the same. Most of them are all made the same way, using the same ingredients. When PlantFusion was started, they made a choice to use better ingredients like yellow peas from northern hills of France and better flavors like vanilla bean from Madagascar. It turns out that these choices mattered because people noticed the difference. You\u2019ll get two red velvet protein powders to help power you through outdoor adventure!\n\nScentuals Soap (https://www.scentuals.com/) - $4.38 - @scentuals - Handmade with a luxuriously soothing blend of peppermint, spearmint and nourishing Olive, Palm and Coconut oils, organic herbs and spices, this soap is a dream. This 100% natural soap creates a rich lather and gently cleanses while hydrating skin. Highly recommended for people with sensitive skin, eczema or psoriasis.\n\nPlum Deluxe Tea (https://www.plumdeluxe.com/teashop) - $7 - @plumdeluxe - These teas give you the best reasons to slow down, to do whatever it is you\u2019re going to do- whether that\u2019s reading your favorite book, writing a piece of prose, a goofy happy dance in the kitchen with your favorite cuppa, or simply staring out of a window. Teas that are punctuated by flavor, aroma, and taste help with whatever moments are ahead of you and make them feel better than they ever did before you poured the tea. We love these!\n\nLiquid IV (https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk) - $4.78 - @liquidiv - Hydration Multiplier is a great-tasting, Non-GMO electrolyte drink mix powered by Cellular Transport Technology (CTT\u00ae\ufe0f ) to deliver hydration to your bloodstream faster & more efficiently than water alone. These taste fantastic, and the best part? 1 Liquid I.V. can provide the same hydration as drinking 2-3 bottles of water & contains 3x the electrolytes of traditional sports drinks with 5 essential vitamins.\n\nOrganic Cotton X-Long Yoga Strap (https://cleveryoga.com/products/yoga-strap?_pos=1&_sid=a647c54fa&_ss=r) - $11.99 - @gocleveryoga - This organic cotton yoga strap has D rings for secure binding when needed, and is extra long, at ten feet! We love a good yoga strap for daily asana practice regardless of how long you\u2019ve been practicing. It can help in restorative poses, balancing poses, and so much more!\n\nAdventure Stickers - $8 - You\u2019re getting 3 adventure themed stickers to help inspire your journaling, one of the best ways to reconnect with yourself and capture a memory beyond the snap of a photo. Use them to decorate the cover of your journal or an individual post!\n\nJournals - $12 - Keep track of your adventures, mood, feelings, thoughts and ideas with this journal. The paper is excellent quality, and the journal is big enough to get all your ideas out on a page or two, but it\u2019s small enough that you can throw in your backpack for hiking, or in your purse for a solo coffee shop visit. \n\nJones Bar - $2.42 (https://jonesbar.com/collections/bars/products/banana-chocolate-chip) - The most delicious, real-foods bar you'll ever taste! I love them for their super simple, clean ingredients list and the taste that's outta this world. I took them to Peru with me to help me on the trek and they were wonderful!",

These are from Bosu which you can find right on their website. This workout will activate the glutes and hamstrings and psoas and quads with the first movement - a forward and backwards monster walk. Next up is a lat pullover - great for the back. The next move is a wall sit with hip abduction - again, great for glutes and hamstrings. Next up we have a face pull - great for upper back strength - if you're a sloucher, this is a good one! \n\nJoin the Intention Factor\u00ae Online Studio Membership for new, full length, yoga, meditation and beginner yogi workouts each month starting at $9.99/mo: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9s9nFu2m3K2CvhO2QVfTg/join\n\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nJoin us every Monday for our podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/namaslay-with-yogabycandace/id1317566150\n\nDownload our App and Opt In for Exclusive Content:\n iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace/id1436839435?mt=8\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.modus.ybc\n\n\nWould you like to take classes in person or online? \nContinuing Ed for Yoga Teachers: https://www.yogabycandace.com/continuing-education-for-yoga-teachers\n\nYoga Retreats and Teacher Trainings: https://www.yogabycandace.com/yoga-retreats-teacher-trainings\n\nOnline Yoga Classes to rent or own starting at $1.99: https://www.gumroad.com/yogabycandace\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\n\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1",

These are from Bosu which you can find right on their website. This workout will activate the glutes and hamstrings and psoas and quads with the first movement - a forward and backwards monster walk. Next up is a lat pullover - great for the back. The next move is a wall sit with hip abduction - again, great for glutes and hamstrings. Next up we have a face pull - great for upper back strength - if you're a sloucher, this is a good one! \n\nJoin the Intention Factor\u00ae Online Studio Membership for new, full length, yoga, meditation and beginner yogi workouts each month starting at $9.99/mo: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9s9nFu2m3K2CvhO2QVfTg/join\n\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nJoin us every Monday for our podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/namaslay-with-yogabycandace/id1317566150\n\nDownload our App and Opt In for Exclusive Content:\n iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace/id1436839435?mt=8\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.modus.ybc\n\n\nWould you like to take classes in person or online? \nContinuing Ed for Yoga Teachers: https://www.yogabycandace.com/continuing-education-for-yoga-teachers\n\nYoga Retreats and Teacher Trainings: https://www.yogabycandace.com/yoga-retreats-teacher-trainings\n\nOnline Yoga Classes to rent or own starting at $1.99: https://www.gumroad.com/yogabycandace\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\n\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

If you don't have a Bosu, that's ok - you can use a foam pad (https://amzn.to/37BGtQg) or anything slightly unstable (cushioned exercise mat, pillow - you can get creative). \n\nAs always, work within a pain-free range and take breaks as needed.

I don't have a favorite foam roller, but I do prefer the high density ones (https://amzn.to/35S1ncJ) and some parts of the body, like the peroneals and calves, can be hard to get, so I like this stick (https://amzn.to/38VWzoR) for those areas. You're going to want to do a quick passthrough of your entire body, pausing for 30 seconds or so on any tender spots. If you don't have a tender spot, then just keep it moving! Foam rolling is great for circulation, and helping to release restricted muscles.

                    "description": "A great way to warm up or cool down, this 15 minute guided foam rolling video should be a staple in your movement practice. I don't have a favorite foam roller, but I do prefer the high density ones (https://amzn.to/35S1ncJ) and some parts of the body, like the peroneals and calves, can be hard to get, so I like this stick (https://amzn.to/38VWzoR) for those areas. You're going to want to do a quick passthrough of your entire body, pausing for 30 seconds or so on any tender spots. If you don't have a tender spot, then just keep it moving! Foam rolling is great for circulation, and helping to release restricted muscles.

A core brace is a great skill to know how to do because it'll help to protect your lumbar spine. This video will teach you how to core brace, then how to use that brace in the dead bug exercise. Following that, we go through a mini vinyasa to practice what it feels like to use the core brace in yoga asana, particularly in transitions. \n\nIf you're interested, I offer custom 6week workout programs aimed to help people with their muscle imbalances: https://www.yogabycandace.com/workout-programs/pt-program\n\nJoin the Online Membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9s9nFu2m3K2CvhO2QVfTg/join\n\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\nJoin us every Monday for our podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/namaslay-with-yogabycandace/id1317566150\n\nDownload our new iOS App and Opt In for Exclusive Content: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace/id1436839435?mt=8\nWould you like to take classes in person?!

A core brace is a great skill to know how to do because it'll help to protect your lumbar spine. This video will teach you how to core brace, then how to use that brace in the dead bug exercise. Following that, we go through a mini vinyasa to practice what it feels like to use the core brace in yoga asana, particularly in transitions. \n\nIf you're interested, I offer custom 6week workout programs aimed to help people with their muscle imbalances: https://www.yogabycandace.com/workout-programs/pt-program\n\nJoin the Online Membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9s9nFu2m3K2CvhO2QVfTg/join\n\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\nJoin us every Monday for our podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/namaslay-with-yogabycandace/id1317566150\n\nDownload our new iOS App and Opt In for Exclusive Content: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace/id1436839435?mt=8\nWould you like to take classes in person?!

Strength training and foam rolling, in additional to yoga, can be really helpful when it comes to improving fallen arches. This movement practice is meant for people who have fallen arches and toes pointing out to the side. This is likely impacting posture, and just like with yoga, it's help to start from the foundation, and when standing and walking, the foundation are our feet. To begin, we will use a foam roller to gently release the peroneals and IT band, and then we will work on a few movements to strengthen the adductors (inner thighs).

You can check them out here: https://zafu.net/yoga-bolster\n\nThis video is the fourth in our four part video series. \nRestorative Yoga Foundations, Pt 1: This video was an informational talk on restorative yoga - what it is, and what it isn't. \nRestorative Yoga Foundations, Pt 2: This video discussed how to calm the monkey mind, and how to sequence a restorative yoga practice. Then, we do a short practice together. \nRestorative Yoga Foundations, Pt 3: The video demonstrated ways we can use various yoga props to make the restorative yoga poses more accessible and more comfortable. Comfort is key for this style of yoga, so this video is really important.\n\nIn this last video, I share three unique restorative yoga poses that I don't typically see programmed into in-studio yoga classes. \n\nHope you enjoyed this series!

This most recent box was Healthy Indulgence. \n\nIt just so happens that we have a few left in stock, so if you love what you see here, order one for yourself (and upon check out, you'll also have the option to pre-order our Intentional Living Mantra Box\u00ae which will ship in February): https://www.yogabycandace.com/ybc-mantra-box\n\nAnd if you enjoy being surprised and would like to pre-order our next quarter's Mantra Box\u00ae, which will ship in late February, 2020, order here: https://www.yogabycandace.com/ybc-mantra-box/mantra-box-living-intentionally-edition\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\nJoin us every Monday for our podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/namaslay-with-yogabycandace/id1317566150\n\nDownload our new iOS App and Opt In for Exclusive Content: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace/id1436839435?mt=8\nWould you like to take classes in person?!

It typically works like this: \n-You pre-order the box for the next quarter and you have no idea what's inside (but it's ALWAYS good stuff I would use myself!)\n-The box costs $49.99 and yes, we ship worldwide\n-You get your box, which is filled with 7-12 health and wellness items from small businesses you likely have never heard of\n-Each box is themed. This most recent box was Healthy Indulgence. \n\nIt just so happens that we have a few left in stock, so if you love what you see here, order one for yourself (and upon check out, you'll also have the option to pre-order our Intentional Living Mantra Box\u00ae which will ship in February): https://www.yogabycandace.com/ybc-mantra-box\n\nAnd if you enjoy being surprised and would like to pre-order our next quarter's Mantra Box\u00ae, which will ship in late February, 2020, order here: https://www.yogabycandace.com/ybc-mantra-box/mantra-box-living-intentionally-edition\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\nJoin us every Monday for our podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/namaslay-with-yogabycandace/id1317566150\n\nDownload our new iOS App and Opt In for Exclusive Content: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace/id1436839435?mt=8\nWould you like to take classes in person?!

The bolsters feature an eco-friendly design sewn with organic cotton and stuffed with hypoallergenic kapok fiber. Their quality is fantastic. You can check them out here: https://zafu.net/yoga-bolster.\n\nWelcome to part three of our four part series (Here's Part 1: https://www.yogabycandace.com/blog/2019/11/27/restorative-yoga-foundations-part-1 and Part 2: https://www.yogabycandace.com/blog/2019/12/9/restorative-yoga-foundations-part-2). \n\nThe goal of this series was to help go a bit deeper into Restorative Yoga, which is a really calming, relaxing style of yoga that is perfect any time of year, but especially during the holiday season, which can be so stressful. Part one was a mostly informational session about Restorative Yoga - what it is, what to expect, and how it's different from yin and other types of yoga. Part two was about how to sequence a restorative yoga class, and a few key concepts to keep in mind. In Part Three, I'm sharing a few ways to manipulate the yoga props so that you (or your students) can feel much more comfortable in the poses. And that's key here - you always want to feel as comfortable as you can when it comes to restorative yoga, because the whole point is about letting go, relaxing into it, melting, and allowing the fascia to gently open up. Hope you enjoy! \n\nIf you're interested in learning more about restorative yoga, consider coming to one of our yoga teacher training programs in 2020!

This video is brought to you by Las Catalinas in Costa Rica - a really amazing walkable town close to Liberia, Costa Rica. They have apartments on property as well as a hotel: https://www.santarenahotel.com/. \n\nFor this practice, you don't even need a yoga mat. We'll begin by finding our center point of gravity and then move into various balancing poses including tree pose, warrior three, some twists, and more. As always, move within a pain-free range, take breaks as needed, and remember to breathe deeply.

This video is brought to you by Las Catalinas in Costa Rica - a really amazing walkable town close to Liberia, Costa Rica. They have apartments on property as well as a hotel: https://www.santarenahotel.com/. \n\nFor this practice, you don't even need a yoga mat. We'll begin by finding our center point of gravity and then move into various balancing poses including tree pose, warrior three, some twists, and more. As always, move within a pain-free range, take breaks as needed, and remember to breathe deeply. Hope you enjoy! \n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\nDownload our new iOS App and Opt In for Exclusive Content: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace/id1436839435?mt=8\nWould you like to take classes in person?!

There are four parts to the core, and this video addresses all of them - the internal and external obliques, the transverse abdominis and the rectus abdominis. If you're looking to strengthen your core, give this a try. As always, move within a pain-free range and take breaks as needed.

It's great for yogis of all ages and all levels - particularly those dealing with a lot of stress or anxiety. For this yoga practice, I am using three yoga bolsters which were generously sent to me by HuggerMugger.com. That said, you don't need to have yoga bolsters to do this practice - get creative and use something like a couch cushion or thick rolled blankets.

It's great for yogis of all ages and all levels - particularly those dealing with a lot of stress or anxiety. For this yoga practice, I am using three yoga bolsters which were generously sent to me by HuggerMugger.com. That said, you don't need to have yoga bolsters to do this practice - get creative and use something like a couch cushion or thick rolled blankets.

Check out their FitJoy bars, a grain-free, non gmo, delicious snack: https://fitjoyfoods.com/products/grandmas-lemon-square-fun-size-bar. \n\nIn this video, we are doing a Core Strengthening Circuit aimed at helping to strengthen the core, particularly the lower core. This will help support the lumbar spine, so is definitely something to do if you're experiencing minor back pain. Strengthening the low core is also really beneficial for people working on their inversions, so if you're aiming to deepen your physical asana practice, start incorporating this video into your practice. I would recommend starting off with this video once or twice a week and working up to three or four times per week.

Check out their FitJoy bars, a grain-free, non gmo, delicious snack: https://fitjoyfoods.com/products/grandmas-lemon-square-fun-size-bar. \n\nIn this video, we are doing a Core Strengthening Circuit aimed at helping to strengthen the core, particularly the lower core. This will help support the lumbar spine, so is definitely something to do if you're experiencing minor back pain. Strengthening the low core is also really beneficial for people working on their inversions, so if you're aiming to deepen your physical asana practice, start incorporating this video into your practice. I would recommend starting off with this video once or twice a week and working up to three or four times per week.

                "description": "Today I'm partnering up with ProSource Fit, who generously sent me two long loop resistance bands (http://shrsl.com/1n4qq) which have been really awesome to help with my strength building, and I thought I would share five ways I've been using them here in this video. You can use coupon code YBC20 for 20% off. \n\nBand Pull-Apart Exercise - This is a great exercise for building the upper back muscles, which is key when you\u2019re getting ready to add inversions like headstand and handstand into your yoga practice. Start with the resistance band out in front of you with arms extended and band pulled taught. Then as you exhale, pull the band apart as far as you comfortably can. Repeat 6-12 times for 3-4 sets. \n\nBanded Lateral Steps - Great for building glutes and leg strength, banded lateral steps are an easy exercise to incorporate into your yoga practice for added strength building work. Begin by stepping onto the resistance band, positioning it under your arches. Then twist the upper part of the loop once and pull up about halfway. Find a slight hip hinge and bend the knees a bit. Then, laterally step for a few steps and go back in the opposite direction for the other side. Repeat 4 steps on your mat side to side for 3-4 sets. \n\nSeated Banded Row - Another good exercise for the upper back, the banded row feels really good with a band with more resistance like the 50-120lb one I\u2019m using in the video. Begin with your legs extended and remove the flesh from under your sitting bones. Position the resistance band around the center of your feet and reach down to extend your arms as far as you comfortable can without compromising the position of your legs. As you exhale, use your back strength to pull the band back as you squeeze the upper back. Repeat 6 -12 times for 3-4 sets. \n\nBanded Loop Squat - These are fantastic for glute strength. Step into the resistance band, positioning the center of your feet over the band. Take your feet about hip distance, with toes slightly pointing out away from you. Squat down and loop the band over your shoulders, bringing your arms through the band and then hold on with your hands. You should feel resistance immediately. As you exhale, press into your feet to activate the glutes and hamstrings and stand up. Go up and down in the squatting position 6-12 times for 3-5 sets. \n\nStretching - Use the large loop resistance band the same way you would use a yoga strap. In the video here, I\u2019m using it for leg extension in the supine position for a nice hamstring stretch, but you could truly use it any way you would normally use a yoga strap. It\u2019s particularly helpful as you cool down from your workout. \nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\nDownload our new iOS App and Opt In for Exclusive Content: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace/id1436839435?mt=8\nWould you like to take classes in person?!

Other than that, it was dirty, and the customer service was atrocious.\nIn LA I stayed at www.TheHollywoodHotel.com, had a facial by www.melissalekus.com, and ate at Tocaya Organica. \nIn Denver, we partnered with www.cappellos.com for gluten-free, paleo friendly pizza and cookies to serve at our meet and greet event. \nIn Vancouver, we stayed at St Regis Vancouver, and had coffee at Matchstick.\nAll the venues we used were found by our Marketing Director Lauren (www.instagram.com/its_spoons) on PeerSpace.com\n\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nJoin me for a Yoga Workshop:\nhttps://www.yogabycandace.com/yoga-workshops/\n\nJoin me for Yoga Teacher Training and Yoga Retreats: \nhttps://www.yogabycandace.com/yoga-retreats-teacher-trainings/\n\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

The top of the bolster has a handle so it's easy to carry and they've got a protective, machine washable cover so you can clean it easily.

I stayed at Shangri-La Al Husn Resort & Spa while in the city a few weeks back (http://www.shangri-la.com/muscat/alhusnresortandspa/) and the scenery was so beautiful in their courtyard, I thought I'd create a gentle yoga video to help release stiff necks and tight shoulders. So if you're someone who sits for long periods of time throughout the day or who frequently experiences stiffness through the neck and shoulders, this video should help.

So I went a week before the training so I could get acclimated to the time change. Accompanying me on this trip was Dan (instagram.com/dtslifeinpictures), who was our Strength and Conditioning coach for the yoga teacher training program. He also works at YBC\u00ae doing media and Mantra Box\u00ae coordination.\n\nWhile at Ritz Carlton Koh Samui, I did a Muay Thai boxing class, got a facial and massage, and we rented a boat which took us out to Mu Ko Ang National Park, which is honestly the most beautiful place I've ever been.\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1",

                    "description": "In early July, I partnered up with Ritz Carlton Koh Samui: http://bit.ly/RitzCarltonKohSamui\n\nI went to Thailand because we did our first Namaslay\u00ae Yoga Teacher Training there (the next one takes place in the US: https://www.yogabycandace.com/blog/2018/5/11/200hr-intensive-namaslay-yoga-teacher-training-in-tennessee). So I went a week before the training so I could get acclimated to the time change. Accompanying me on this trip was Dan (instagram.com/dtslifeinpictures), who was our Strength and Conditioning coach for the yoga teacher training program. He also works at YBC\u00ae doing media and Mantra Box\u00ae coordination.\n\nWhile at Ritz Carlton Koh Samui, I did a Muay Thai boxing class, got a facial and massage, and we rented a boat which took us out to Mu Ko Ang National Park, which is honestly the most beautiful place I've ever been.\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

The yoga and breathing video starts with a pranayama exercise (a breathing exercise). I'll guide you through the breathwork which should help slow down your heart rate, calm your mind, and begin to ease stress. From there, we will do a little bit of movement to facilitate better breathing and help open up the lungs. It definitely isn't a long yoga practice with much movement to it, but I created this for people who are super busy and just want a quick way to help ease anxieties and stress. \n \nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace-official-app/id1019379957?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.veam.veam31000506&hl=en\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1",

The yoga and breathing video starts with a pranayama exercise (a breathing exercise). I'll guide you through the breathwork which should help slow down your heart rate, calm your mind, and begin to ease stress. From there, we will do a little bit of movement to facilitate better breathing and help open up the lungs. It definitely isn't a long yoga practice with much movement to it, but I created this for people who are super busy and just want a quick way to help ease anxieties and stress. \n \nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace-official-app/id1019379957?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.veam.veam31000506&hl=en\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

This 30 Day program is designed by our Strength and Conditioning coach Dan Tavino (@dtslifeinpictures on instagram), and you can find it here: https://www.yogabycandace.com/workout-programs/namaslay-supplemental-30-day-glute-strengthening-and-yoga-program\n\nThis is not a complete program; the intention is for these exercises to go alongside what you are currently doing. These movements will help invigorate and target muscle groups that may have been ignored. It is designed so that you can do it anywhere - minimal equipment required.\n\nAll exercises will have a link to a demo video; so if you are unsure of how to perform the movement just click the link and watch how it is done\n\nThere are Yoga Flows included that are designed specifically for the lower body\n\nAll exercises can be done without any weights. Simply perform the movement without the prescribed weight. Feel free to be creative as well; chairs, stools, benches, etc\u2026 can all be used in substitute for a box. Any items can be used as weights as well. Be safe and have fun.\n\nOptional Equipment - Any gym will have these available, here are some links if you prefer working out at home\n\nResistance band\n\nAssorted dumbbells/kettlebells*\n\nbox\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace-official-app/id1019379957?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.veam.veam31000506&hl=en\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1",

                    "description": "A few months ago, I wrote this post on glute strength: https://www.yogabycandace.com/blog/movements-to-build-glute-strength and we had a number of requests to develop a program for people who are new to strength building, so we did. This 30 Day program is designed by our Strength and Conditioning coach Dan Tavino (@dtslifeinpictures on instagram), and you can find it here: https://www.yogabycandace.com/workout-programs/namaslay-supplemental-30-day-glute-strengthening-and-yoga-program\n\nThis is not a complete program; the intention is for these exercises to go alongside what you are currently doing. These movements will help invigorate and target muscle groups that may have been ignored. It is designed so that you can do it anywhere - minimal equipment required.\n\nAll exercises will have a link to a demo video; so if you are unsure of how to perform the movement just click the link and watch how it is done\n\nThere are Yoga Flows included that are designed specifically for the lower body\n\nAll exercises can be done without any weights. Simply perform the movement without the prescribed weight. Feel free to be creative as well; chairs, stools, benches, etc\u2026 can all be used in substitute for a box. Any items can be used as weights as well. Be safe and have fun.\n\nOptional Equipment - Any gym will have these available, here are some links if you prefer working out at home\n\nResistance band\n\nAssorted dumbbells/kettlebells*\n\nbox\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace-official-app/id1019379957?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.veam.veam31000506&hl=en\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

For the look, you'll need a comb\u00a0and two\u00a0elastics.\u00a0\nSide French Braid with Two Mini Buns: This is a look I did all the time when I had super short hair. For the look, you'll\u00a0need a comb\u00a0and three\u00a0elastics.\u00a0\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace-official-app/id1019379957?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.veam.veam31000506&hl=en\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

You'll need an ottoman or something of similar height. To begin, position your upper back so it's against the ottoman, and then step your feet about halfway away from your body. Then, press into your heels to extend up through your hips. Aim for 3-5 rounds of 15-25 reps, being sure to squeeze the glutes at the top. Try incorporating this movement a few times per week in order to build strength through the glutes.

If you're looking to get a quick stretch in, this vid's for you! \n\nWe'll have some forward folds to help open up the hamstrings and release tension in the low back. We also have some standing splits in there, which are nice not only for the hamstrings but also the hip flexors as well. We'll open up through the inner thighs and side body as well. As always, work within a pain-free range.\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace-official-app/id1019379957?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.veam.veam31000506&hl=en\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

WTRX is a new water extreme class now available at select Life Time Fitness locations across the US. It will challenge your impression of the traditional aqua class because it combines the camaraderie of the ultimate bootcamp format with lower impact water movements. It was a challenging work out and I loved that it helps to build strength, making it an excellent complement to the yoga practice.

WTRX is a new water extreme class now available at select Life Time Fitness locations across the US. It will challenge your impression of the traditional aqua class because it combines the camaraderie of the ultimate bootcamp format with lower impact water movements. It was a challenging work out and I loved that it helps to build strength, making it an excellent complement to the yoga practice.

As always, move within a pain-fre range.\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nOur book is now available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2fMPcBj\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace-official-app/id1019379957?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.veam.veam31000506&hl=en\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

We'll begin with a centering to find calmness and stillness. From here we'll move into child's pose and from there move into sphinx pose, some push ups, and then move into a flow that includes downward facing dog, lunges, warrior three, and more. We'll explore utkatasana (chair pose) to fire up the legs, and squats. Then, we will do a bit of back body strengthening while on our stomachs.

We'll begin with a centering to find calmness and stillness. From here we'll move into child's pose and from there move into sphinx pose, some push ups, and then move into a flow that includes downward facing dog, lunges, warrior three, and more. We'll explore utkatasana (chair pose) to fire up the legs, and squats. Then, we will do a bit of back body strengthening while on our stomachs.

Using their AO+ Mist before or after you workout helps reduce body odor and makes your skin feel smooth and refreshed. They also have 2 supporting products - the Shampoo and Cleanser.

It's challenging especially for the upper body and shoulder area. Always listen to your body, honor how you feel, and work within a pain-free range. \n\nThe first movement is a shoulder tap. Come into a plank position and rock side to side as you touch your hand to your shoulder. We will do this ten times.\n\nThe next movement is mountain climbers, where you will quickly change feet ten times.\n\nThe last movement is a push up. You can modify this by coming down onto your knees. Just make sure your hips are forward so your body is in a diagonal line. I like to have my elbows straight back behind me just like in chaturanga.

                "description": "This week's slow flow yoga practice is great to warm up first thing in the morning, cool down after a workout or run, or wind down at the end of the day. We will start with a centering to ground yourself, and work on the ujjayi breath. Then we'll come into child's pose, and do some variations to open up the side body. Slowly from there we will begin the flow. Vinyasa means flow so we will be constantly moving in a slow flow manner. Cobra pose comes next, then child's, then we will round forward and come into downward facing down. We'll open up the hip flexors and hamstrings, and move through a playfully sequenced flow.

                    "description": "This week's slow flow yoga practice is great to warm up first thing in the morning, cool down after a workout or run, or wind down at the end of the day. We will start with a centering to ground yourself, and work on the ujjayi breath. Then we'll come into child's pose, and do some variations to open up the side body. Slowly from there we will begin the flow. Vinyasa means flow so we will be constantly moving in a slow flow manner. Cobra pose comes next, then child's, then we will round forward and come into downward facing down. We'll open up the hip flexors and hamstrings, and move through a playfully sequenced flow. I hope you love it! \n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace-official-app/id1019379957?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.veam.veam31000506&hl=en\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

Also gluten free!\n\nBath Salts - These will be great to help with DOMS recovery and for relaxation. \n\nBlender Bottle - You can never have too many, and I love that this one has two little compartments to put supplements, keys or protein powder.\n\nMaca Powder - All you need is a teaspoon in your protein shake or morning smoothie and you'll be on your way to balanced health and hormones.\n\nQuinoa - I like to cook these in bone broth for added flavor and nutrition and serve it in salads or as a side. \n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogabycandace-official-app/id1019379957?mt=8\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.veam.veam31000506&hl=en\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-classes-1/\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

This is the video you'll want to do to help build strength for poses like handstand, and other inversions. Building solid abdominal strength is also excellent for helping to prevent back pain, so I always recommend core strengthening for people dealing with back issues.

This is the video you'll want to do to help build strength for poses like handstand, and other inversions. Building solid abdominal strength is also excellent for helping to prevent back pain, so I always recommend core strengthening for people dealing with back issues. As always, move with intention and avoid pain. Take rests as needed and always listen to you body.\n\nPlease subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don\u2019t miss out on our weekly yoga classes!\n\nDownload our YogaByCandace Official App on iTunes and Android: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yogab...\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/de...\n\nFor more with YogaByCandace, check out:\n\nBlog - http://www.yogabycandace.com\nForum - http://www.forum.yogabycandace.com\n\nDownloadable Yoga Classes:\nhttp://yogabycandace.com/online-yoga-...\n\nSocial Media:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/yogabycandace\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/yogabycandace\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/yogabycandace\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/yogabycandace\nTumblr - http://www.tumblr.com/yogabycandace\nNewsletter - http://eepurl.com/Ex-H1"

This means I'll start and do one push up, and then I'll rest while you do one push up. Then, I'll do two push ups while you rest, and will rest while you do two push ups, etc. We'll go up to ten and then back down to one. It's a lot of push ups! Go onto your knees if you need a break, or press pause and catch your breath.

This means I'll start and do one push up, and then I'll rest while you do one push up. Then, I'll do two push ups while you rest, and will rest while you do two push ups, etc. We'll go up to ten and then back down to one. It's a lot of push ups! Go onto your knees if you need a break, or press pause and catch your breath.

In this episode, we're talking leggings from three brands you may not have heard of - Sweaty Betty, Alo Yoga and Kira Grace. While these pants were gifted to me, all opinions - as always - are my own. I love these leggings because they all have a gusset for comfort, are opaque so no show through when you practice or workout, and they're excellent quality with great compression for yoga or working out. Excellent workout pants. Links for purchase: \n1. Sweaty Betty: http://goo.gl/smMRpj\n2. Alo Yoga: http://goo.gl/MHIa9u\n3.

In this episode, we're talking leggings from three brands you may not have heard of - Sweaty Betty, Alo Yoga and Kira Grace. While these pants were gifted to me, all opinions - as always - are my own. I love these leggings because they all have a gusset for comfort, are opaque so no show through when you practice or workout, and they're excellent quality with great compression for yoga or working out. Excellent workout pants. Links for purchase: \n1. Sweaty Betty: http://goo.gl/smMRpj\n2. Alo Yoga: http://goo.gl/MHIa9u\n3.

Hip opening is excellent for relieving tension, and may actually improve back pain and posture issues. The use of the bench is especially helpful for people with limited flexibility and who are relatively new to yoga. You'll see poses like downward facing dog, pigeon pose, and more in this sequence to help loosen tight muscles and improve flexibility.

How did you overcome this fear and what do you suggest I do? \n\nAnswer, 2:42.\n\nQ3. 4:21: I've practiced yoga for ten years more or less regularly. I started yoga teacher training and in class we did a partner exercise for handstands. we had a partner supporting us while we tried to go into full handstand. It was very hard for me though someone was holding my legs and there for me. I don't know why I was not able to do this exercise the way it should've been done.

The intention is to work all parts of the core including the upper abs, lower abs and obliques in a variety of ways that keeps the body guessing. \n\nIn this flow, we also practice a few arm balances including baby grasshopper pose.
