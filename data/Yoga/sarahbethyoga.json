Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body. So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\nCHAPTERS:\n00:00 welcome\n00:45 Child's Pose\n01:57 Swimmers\n03:22 Downdog\n04:25 Chair Pose\n05:16 Crescent Lunge\n09:39 Modified planks\n11:31 Feel the BURN \ud83d\udd25\n12:50 Low Cobra\n14:00 Child's Pose\n15:05 Namaste\n15:40 Try the FREE 7 day Beginner Yoga Challenge\n\nWELCOME to your \"Modern Day Yoga\" YouTube channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss-free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga  \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\ud83d\udc99 DOWNLOAD & Take your favorite yoga videos with you in the SarahBethYoga App and get the entire SBY library of 700+ ad-free & downloadable yoga videos, +250 exclusive videos, classes & calendars including:\n\u20226 week Beginner Yoga Program\n\u202260+ full-length 45 minute & 60 minute yoga classes\n\u202240+ monthly yoga calendars\n\u2022Yoga Pose Breakdowns\n\u2022Yoga Tips series\n\u2022Live calls in our private Facebook group\n\u2022Printable PDF guides like: What is Yoga Guide, How to Yoga Guide, Yoga Lingo Guide\n\u2022Access on all devices: iOS, Android, Desktop, Roku, AppleTV, FireTV\n\nLearn more about the SarahBethYoga APP & join us at: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e BEGINNER YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyBeginners\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\n\nSarah Beth from Sarah Beth Yoga LLC strongly recommends that you consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.

                    "description": "Get on your mat for this simple 15 minute yoga for beginners WEIGHT LOSS & TONING yoga routine \ud83d\udd25 for a fat-burning beginners yoga workout to tone, strengthen & stretch. \n\u2b50\ufe0f FREE GIFT:  Beginner Yoga Calendar https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/byc\n\nYou'll practice basic power yoga poses including properly setting up a lunge and modified planks to help you build core strength, and BURN *I mean tone* your hips, core, back & arms. \n\nBUT LET'S BE CLEAR: Yoga is not a cure. Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body. So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\nCHAPTERS:\n00:00 welcome\n00:45 Child's Pose\n01:57 Swimmers\n03:22 Downdog\n04:25 Chair Pose\n05:16 Crescent Lunge\n09:39 Modified planks\n11:31 Feel the BURN \ud83d\udd25\n12:50 Low Cobra\n14:00 Child's Pose\n15:05 Namaste\n15:40 Try the FREE 7 day Beginner Yoga Challenge\n\nWELCOME to your \"Modern Day Yoga\" YouTube channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss-free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga  \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\ud83d\udc99 DOWNLOAD & Take your favorite yoga videos with you in the SarahBethYoga App and get the entire SBY library of 700+ ad-free & downloadable yoga videos, +250 exclusive videos, classes & calendars including:\n\u20226 week Beginner Yoga Program\n\u202260+ full-length 45 minute & 60 minute yoga classes\n\u202240+ monthly yoga calendars\n\u2022Yoga Pose Breakdowns\n\u2022Yoga Tips series\n\u2022Live calls in our private Facebook group\n\u2022Printable PDF guides like: What is Yoga Guide, How to Yoga Guide, Yoga Lingo Guide\n\u2022Access on all devices: iOS, Android, Desktop, Roku, AppleTV, FireTV\n\nLearn more about the SarahBethYoga APP & join us at: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e BEGINNER YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyBeginners\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\n\nSarah Beth from Sarah Beth Yoga LLC strongly recommends that you consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.

Great power yoga workout for weight loss. \ud83d\udd25 GET THE 5 MIN QUICK ABS: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/5-minute-quick-abs\n\nBUT LET'S BE CLEAR: Yoga is not a cure. Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body. So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd WELCOME to your modern day yoga channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga  \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e POWER YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyPower\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\n\nSarah Beth from Sarah Beth Yoga LLC strongly recommends that you consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.

Great power yoga workout for weight loss. \ud83d\udd25 GET THE 5 MIN QUICK ABS: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/5-minute-quick-abs\n\nBUT LET'S BE CLEAR: Yoga is not a cure. Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body. So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd WELCOME to your modern day yoga channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga  \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e POWER YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyPower\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\n\nSarah Beth from Sarah Beth Yoga LLC strongly recommends that you consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.

Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body.

Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body. So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd WELCOME to your modern day yoga channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \n\n\ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga  \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\u25b6\ufe0e POWER YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyPower\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\n\nDisclaimer: Some links may be affiliate links which help support Sarah Beth to create content, however Sarah Beth only promotes products she truly likes and all opinions are her own.

Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot.

It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body.

Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body. So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd WELCOME to your modern day yoga channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \n\n\ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga each week: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e MORNING YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyMorning\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\n\nDisclaimer: Some links may be affiliate links which help support Sarah Beth to create content, however Sarah Beth only promotes products she truly likes and all opinions are her own.

Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body. So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\nWELCOME to your \"Modern Day Yoga\" YouTube channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss-free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga  \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\ud83d\udc99 DOWNLOAD & Take your favorite yoga videos with you in the SarahBethYoga App and get the entire SBY library of 700+ ad-free & downloadable yoga videos, +250 exclusive videos, classes & calendars including:\n\u2022Beginner, Prenatal & Tone Yoga Programs\n\u202240+ full-length 45 minute & 60 minute yoga classes\n\u202240+ monthly yoga calendars\n\u2022Yoga Pose Breakdowns\n\u2022Yoga Tips series\n\u2022Live calls in our private Facebook group\n\u2022Printable PDF guides like: What is Yoga Guide, How to Yoga Guide, Yoga Lingo Guide\n\u2022Access on all devices: iOS, Android, Desktop, Roku, AppleTV, FireTV\n\nLearn more about the SarahBethYoga APP & join us at: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e MORNING YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyMorning\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\n\nSarah Beth from Sarah Beth Yoga LLC strongly recommends that you consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.

Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body. So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\nWELCOME to your \"Modern Day Yoga\" YouTube channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss-free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga  \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\ud83d\udc99 DOWNLOAD & Take your favorite yoga videos with you in the SarahBethYoga App and get the entire SBY library of 700+ ad-free & downloadable yoga videos, +250 exclusive videos, classes & calendars including:\n\u2022Beginner, Prenatal & Tone Yoga Programs\n\u202240+ full-length 45 minute & 60 minute yoga classes\n\u202240+ monthly yoga calendars\n\u2022Yoga Pose Breakdowns\n\u2022Yoga Tips series\n\u2022Live calls in our private Facebook group\n\u2022Printable PDF guides like: What is Yoga Guide, How to Yoga Guide, Yoga Lingo Guide\n\u2022Access on all devices: iOS, Android, Desktop, Roku, AppleTV, FireTV\n\nLearn more about the SarahBethYoga APP & join us at: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e MORNING YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyMorning\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\n\nSarah Beth from Sarah Beth Yoga LLC strongly recommends that you consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program.

Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time. I know from personal experience how that feels, as I have lost 40 & 50 lbs from both of my pregnancies and the weight didn't just melt off after. It took at least a year of focused effort, exercise, healthy eating, a mild calorie deficit and this exact type of yoga for me to lose the weight and feel strong and confident in my body. So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\nWELCOME to your \"Modern Day Yoga\" YouTube channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss-free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga  \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\ud83d\udc99 DOWNLOAD & Take your favorite yoga videos with you in the SarahBethYoga App and get the entire SBY library of 700+ ad-free & downloadable yoga videos, +250 exclusive videos, classes & calendars including:\n\u2022Beginner, Prenatal & Tone Yoga Programs\n\u202240+ full-length 45 minute & 60 minute yoga classes\n\u202240+ monthly yoga calendars\n\u2022Yoga Pose Breakdowns\n\u2022Yoga Tips series\n\u2022Live calls in our private Facebook group\n\u2022Printable PDF guides like: What is Yoga Guide, How to Yoga Guide, Yoga Lingo Guide\n\u2022Access on all devices: iOS, Android, Desktop, Roku, AppleTV, FireTV\n\nLearn more about the SarahBethYoga APP & join us at: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\u25b6\ufe0e POWER YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyPower\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nYOGA PROPS, YTT, RETREATS:\n\nCheck out my recommendations for yoga mats, bolster, blocks, yoga teacher training, retreats and more in the SarahBethYoga Resource Center: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/resource-center\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nPlease mail letters, packages & PR to: \n\nSarahBethYoga\nP.O.

So I created these videos to meet the viewers where they are, help them along in their weight loss journey and hopefully teach them self-love, strength & mindfulness along the way. \ud83d\udc99\n\nWELCOME to your \"Modern Day Yoga\" YouTube channel by Sarah Beth Yoga where you can find clear & fuss-free yoga videos ranging from short 10 minute yoga routines to longer 30 minute yoga practices for all levels to help you get stronger, happier & healthier. \ud83d\ude0d SUBSCRIBE for MORE free yoga: http://bit.ly/sarahbethyoga  \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nMORE YOGA: \n\n\u2728SarahBethYoga APP \u2728\nhttps://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\ud83d\udc99 DOWNLOAD & Take your favorite yoga videos with you in the SarahBethYoga App and get the entire SBY library of 700+ ad-free & downloadable yoga videos, +250 exclusive videos, classes & calendars including:\n\u2022Beginner, Prenatal & Tone Yoga Programs\n\u202240+ full-length 45 minute & 60 minute yoga classes\n\u202240+ monthly yoga calendars\n\u2022Yoga Pose Breakdowns\n\u2022Yoga Tips series\n\u2022Live calls in our private Facebook group\n\u2022Printable PDF guides like: What is Yoga Guide, How to Yoga Guide, Yoga Lingo Guide\n\u2022Access on all devices: iOS, Android, Desktop, Roku, AppleTV, FireTV\n\nLearn more about the SarahBethYoga APP & join us at: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/join\n\n\u25b6\ufe0e YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyWEIGHTLOSS\n\u25b6\ufe0e POWER YOGA PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/sbyPower\n\n\ud83d\udc99  Facebook: /sarahbethyoga\n\ud83d\udc9c  Instagram: @sarahbethyoga\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nYOGA PROPS, YTT, RETREATS:\n\nCheck out my recommendations for yoga mats, bolster, blocks, yoga teacher training, retreats and more in the SarahBethYoga Resource Center: https://www.sarahbethyoga.com/resource-center\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\nPlease mail letters, packages & PR to: \n\nSarahBethYoga\nP.O.

Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time.

Yoga is a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can get into a fat burning heart rate zone, sweat, strengthen & burn ample calories with power yoga and power vinyasa yoga flows, but if you want to lose weight and practice yoga you must accompany the practice with self-care and healthy habits off the mat. Yoga can be a wonderful practice for de-stressing, connecting mind with body, improving body awareness & learning to love yourself. And guess what? You can love yourself and be a work in progress at the same time! The term \"Yoga for weight loss\" is a high ranking SEO term, as in it is searched a lot. I use the term to reach a wider audience to help people who are looking for a way to lose excess weight and practice yoga at the same time.
