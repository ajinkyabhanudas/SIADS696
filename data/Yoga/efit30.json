                    "description": "Join our January Workout Challenge here: https://efit30.com/blog/january-workout-calendar\n\nThe Pilates 100 is one of the basic, staple Pilates exercises used to strengthen the abdominal muscles, build body stability and strengthen the lower back. The Pilates 100 also reinforces proper Pilates breathing techniques. \n\nOne modification for the Pilates 100 is to keep your knees at a bent position the entire time. Alternatively if your hip flexors are bothering you, place your feet on the floor and practice the exercise with your legs down.\n\nUse this video as a finisher to another workout or when you have five minutes to focus on core! \n\nPilates doesn\u2019t just give you strong abs, these amazing exercise also strengthen your deep postural muscles that support alignment and encourage you to stay strong, long and walking tall.\n\nJoin our free WORKOUT CHALLENGE today.

It travels up the entire posterior (back) side of the body, moving up over the head and finishes at the brow bone.\n \nThe function of this line is to extend the body. It brings the body into an erect an upright position and gives it strength.\n \nThis line is considered to be the original primary curve of the body. As we develop from infancy with movements of extension (ie, raising the head and neck) we develop opposing curves that help create balance. These other curves are known as secondary curves.\n \nThe body is balanced from head to toe using the primary and secondary curves.\n \nThe secondary curves consist of the Neck curvature, lower back curvature, knee curvature and feet curvature.\n \nDysfunctions in the Superficial Back Line usually occur in these secondary curve regions.\n \nDysfunctions in the SBL can lead to many diferent injuries and generalized weakness that can perpetuate dysfunctions in other regions of the body.\n \nCompensatory patterns can also develop and the strain through this fascial line can be directed by other fascial lines of pull.  \n \nIt is important to note that dysfunctions can occur anywhere along the fascial line and that it can create pain or symptoms far from the source.  Your Therapist is trained to assess and treat the dysfunctions.\n \nAlthough the Therapist may not necessarily work over the area where you are feeling the greatest amount of pain, her intent is always to search for and treat the primary area of restriction.\n \nBecause fascia is all connected, treatment in one area will always affect another area. #eFit30 #fitness #yoga #Pilates #exercise #health\n\n For promotional opportunities or YouTube company consulting work contact John Dawson here;  https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndawson101\n\nJoin us for our FREE Monthly Workout Challenge.

It travels up the entire posterior (back) side of the body, moving up over the head and finishes at the brow bone.\n \nThe function of this line is to extend the body. It brings the body into an erect an upright position and gives it strength.\n \nThis line is considered to be the original primary curve of the body. As we develop from infancy with movements of extension (ie, raising the head and neck) we develop opposing curves that help create balance. These other curves are known as secondary curves.\n \nThe body is balanced from head to toe using the primary and secondary curves.\n \nThe secondary curves consist of the Neck curvature, lower back curvature, knee curvature and feet curvature.\n \nDysfunctions in the Superficial Back Line usually occur in these secondary curve regions.\n \nDysfunctions in the SBL can lead to many diferent injuries and generalized weakness that can perpetuate dysfunctions in other regions of the body.\n \nCompensatory patterns can also develop and the strain through this fascial line can be directed by other fascial lines of pull.  \n \nIt is important to note that dysfunctions can occur anywhere along the fascial line and that it can create pain or symptoms far from the source.  Your Therapist is trained to assess and treat the dysfunctions.\n \nAlthough the Therapist may not necessarily work over the area where you are feeling the greatest amount of pain, her intent is always to search for and treat the primary area of restriction.\n \nBecause fascia is all connected, treatment in one area will always affect another area. #eFit30 #fitness #yoga #Pilates #exercise #health\n\n For promotional opportunities or YouTube company consulting work contact John Dawson here;  https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndawson101\n\nJoin us for our FREE Monthly Workout Challenge.

The Superficial Front Line functionally balances the Superficial Back Line in the sagittal (anterior-posterior) plane.  As we saw earlier, the SBL acts to contract the back of the body and then stretches during forward bends.  The SFL, antagonistic to this, acts to contract the front of the body and then stretches during backbending activities.\nThe SFL begins on the dorsal surface of the toes through the short and long toe extensor muscles.  This includes the anterior crural compartment and the anterior tibialis muscle.  The boney station that the meridian attaches to is the tibial tuberosity. #eFit30 #fitness #yoga #Pilates #exercise #health\n\n For promotional opportunities or YouTube company consulting work contact John Dawson here;  https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndawson101\n\nJoin us for our FREE Monthly Workout Challenge.

The Superficial Front Line functionally balances the Superficial Back Line in the sagittal (anterior-posterior) plane.  As we saw earlier, the SBL acts to contract the back of the body and then stretches during forward bends.  The SFL, antagonistic to this, acts to contract the front of the body and then stretches during backbending activities.\nThe SFL begins on the dorsal surface of the toes through the short and long toe extensor muscles.  This includes the anterior crural compartment and the anterior tibialis muscle.  The boney station that the meridian attaches to is the tibial tuberosity. #eFit30 #fitness #yoga #Pilates #exercise #health\n\n For promotional opportunities or YouTube company consulting work contact John Dawson here;  https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndawson101\n\nJoin us for our FREE Monthly Workout Challenge.

On a personal level yoga has help me find balance and forgiveness through tough times. It has also aided in the recovery of major injuries from years of performing and training. Mentally it has given me a quiet space to let go and reset my busy mind. I am so lucky to be able to share my journey and passion everyday.\n\nMy greatest reward as a Yoga teacher is watching clients make changes in their lives, teaching simple techniques that you can then apply to your daily life. Its so exciting to watch people relax & unwind on a yoga retreat, or master a headstand during a workshop, or learning to manage a tough injury over the course of private yoga tuition. \n\nhttp://www.chloepotteryoga.com.au\n\n For promotional opportunities or YouTube company consulting work contact John Dawson here;  https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndawson101\n\nJoin us for our FREE Monthly Workout Challenge.

On a personal level yoga has help me find balance and forgiveness through tough times. It has also aided in the recovery of major injuries from years of performing and training. Mentally it has given me a quiet space to let go and reset my busy mind. I am so lucky to be able to share my journey and passion everyday.\n\nMy greatest reward as a Yoga teacher is watching clients make changes in their lives, teaching simple techniques that you can then apply to your daily life. Its so exciting to watch people relax & unwind on a yoga retreat, or master a headstand during a workshop, or learning to manage a tough injury over the course of private yoga tuition. \n\nhttp://www.chloepotteryoga.com.au\n\n For promotional opportunities or YouTube company consulting work contact John Dawson here;  https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndawson101\n\nJoin us for our FREE Monthly Workout Challenge.

My passion is bringing balance, clarity, strength and joy to the day-to-day lives of everybody through the practice of yoga. Drawing on my strong anatomical knowledge and experience of yoga philosophy, my aim is to provide a safe place for students to discover their strength and flexibility both on and off the mat.\n\nInitially learning yoga in Sydney, I began to develop my own self-practice whilst living in remote locations around Australia and Thailand. I completed my first official yoga teacher training in Singapore with Tirisula Yoga and recently completed my 500hr training at Absolute Yoga Academy in Thailand.\n\nMy passion for teaching is absolute and my classes are different to most. I invite you to come and experience one of my classes with a single class session if you are new or unsure. I believe in sharing yoga not only as a series of movements, but as a philosophy and a way of life.\n\nMay the light from your practice follow you throughout your journey~\n\nhttps://www.rhyannavl.com/ \n\nSpecial Thanks to Zanny Media http://www.zannymedia.com.au/ #eFit30 #fitness #yoga #Pilates #exercise #health\n\n For promotional opportunities or YouTube company consulting work contact John Dawson here;  https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndawson101\n\nJoin us for our FREE Monthly Workout Challenge.

My passion is bringing balance, clarity, strength and joy to the day-to-day lives of everybody through the practice of yoga. Drawing on my strong anatomical knowledge and experience of yoga philosophy, my aim is to provide a safe place for students to discover their strength and flexibility both on and off the mat.\n\nInitially learning yoga in Sydney, I began to develop my own self-practice whilst living in remote locations around Australia and Thailand. I completed my first official yoga teacher training in Singapore with Tirisula Yoga and recently completed my 500hr training at Absolute Yoga Academy in Thailand.\n\nMy passion for teaching is absolute and my classes are different to most. I invite you to come and experience one of my classes with a single class session if you are new or unsure. I believe in sharing yoga not only as a series of movements, but as a philosophy and a way of life.\n\nMay the light from your practice follow you throughout your journey~\n\nhttps://www.rhyannavl.com/ \n\nSpecial Thanks to Zanny Media http://www.zannymedia.com.au/ #eFit30 #fitness #yoga #Pilates #exercise #health\n\n For promotional opportunities or YouTube company consulting work contact John Dawson here;  https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndawson101\n\nJoin us for our FREE Monthly Workout Challenge.

Total time for the entire circuit workout is approximately 7 minutes. The circuit can be repeated 2 to 3 times.\n\nFor more health tips and weight loss tools like recipes, calorie counters, apps etc, see our website. www.efit30.com.au Our trainers are dressed by Lululemon Athletica #eFit30 #fitness #yoga #Pilates #exercise #health\n\n For promotional opportunities or YouTube company consulting work contact John Dawson here;  https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndawson101\n\nJoin our new super effective 30 Day SQUAT CHALLENGE.

This is an intense routine!\n\nYou will need a mat.\n\nWhat Are Plyometrics?\n\nUnlike typical strength training exercises that involve long, slow movements designed to increase muscular strength and mass, plyometric exercises involve quick, explosive movements designed to increase speed and power.\n\nA plyometric exercise consists of three phases. The first is a rapid muscle lengthening movement called the eccentric phase. Second comes a short resting period called the amortization phase. Finally, the athlete engages in an explosive muscle shortening movement called the concentric phase. The athlete repeats this three-part cycle as quickly as he can.\n\nThe goal of plyometric exercises is to decrease the amount of time in-between the eccentric and concentric movements. By reducing the time in-between these two movements, a man can become faster and more powerful.\n\n\nDo 15, 30 or 45 minutes by adding in more eFit30 routines at the end of this, This is part of the superset series workout 3, Choose to do 15, 30, or 45 minutes of exercise!
