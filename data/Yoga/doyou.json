You'll build strength, increase flexibility, and improve blood flow in your entire body.\n\nAfter this session you'll feel fresh and strong from head to toe.\n\nYou can pair this video Day 1 of our 30-Day Yoga Challenge to stretch out after your workout: https://youtu.be/LhX7VJxkTyU\n\nThe sequence uses focused activation, anatomical awareness, and targeted movements to build power and stamina in the core muscles.\n\nAn engaged core is very important not just for your yoga practice but in live in general. Come back to this video whenever you need a core strength booster.\n\nLet me know how it went in the comments :-)",

                "description": "Meagan McCrary offers a quick guide to using yoga blocks for yogis and yoginis with tighter shoulders and/or not enough arm and shoulder strength. For a deeper backbend, try using two blocks at the wall. Wedge the blocks a bit wider than your shoulders into where the floor meets the wall. Then lie on your back with your head between the blocks (crown of the head nearly touching the wall).\n \nPlace your feet the same as above and the heels of your hands on the blocks. Point both elbow tips up to the ceiling and draw your shoulder blades back. Then press up to the crown of your head and repeat the same actions as above. \n\nJoin the most awesome yoga community online! http://www.doyouyoga.com/community\n\nPlease subscribe! http://bit.ly/doyouyoga",

                    "description": "Meagan McCrary offers a quick guide to using yoga blocks for yogis and yoginis with tighter shoulders and/or not enough arm and shoulder strength. For a deeper backbend, try using two blocks at the wall. Wedge the blocks a bit wider than your shoulders into where the floor meets the wall. Then lie on your back with your head between the blocks (crown of the head nearly touching the wall).\n \nPlace your feet the same as above and the heels of your hands on the blocks. Point both elbow tips up to the ceiling and draw your shoulder blades back. Then press up to the crown of your head and repeat the same actions as above. \n\nJoin the most awesome yoga community online! http://www.doyouyoga.com/community\n\nPlease subscribe! http://bit.ly/doyouyoga"
