Today's vinyasa flow yoga class is intermediate and leads to the peak pose called eka pada koundinyasana (aka scissors pose). I have also created a playlist of yoga practices for each day of the week here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEs9dX8UXFZqjEiNK8M1c6A6SQ0xZCSp1 Eka means \"one,\" \"pada\" means foot and Koundinya was a scholar who became a buddhist monk after learning about the \"middle way\" from the Buddha. To practice the yoga pose eka pada koundinyasana we need to warm up the hips and shoulders with vinyasa flow. We also need to connect to our core muscles to find the \"middle way.\" Scissors yoga pose is less about strength and more about leverage and balance. I find the idea of a fulcrum to be helpful. Remember being at the playground enjoying the teeter-totter or seesaw with a friend? It was important that you both weighed about the same amount and it was also important that one of you didn't decide to hop off while the other was in the air! Remember when you could find that perfect balance?  It was pretty effortless, right? There's a center point in the peak yoga pose eka pada koundinyasana that you'll find after practicing vinyasa for a while. You find it in your body. Balance. The Middle Way. You may need to test the extremes first to find balance, but once you've tested the extremes. you'll find that the point of balance will come with much less effort. Lean yourself forward enough to get your back leg to lift. If you don't have the flexibility to straighten your front leg, don't worry...you can practice the posture with the front leg bent. Most importantly, practice with your breath, attention and intention and enjoy the journey. Yoga poses come and poses go...enjoy the ride.

My yoga videos are to keep you strong and healthy. My mission is to surround you with a supportive Fightmaster Yoga community.\n\nHandstands are difficult and can be scary to attempt whether it's in a live yoga class or not. You've seen beautiful photos or yoga videos of others doing handstands. You might be thinking, \"why can't I do it?\" \"What's wrong with me?!?\"\n\nBut, the truth is that doing a handstand isn't the \"goal\" of this free yoga video because yoga is never about the pose.\n\nI know handstands are difficult. I've been practicing them for years and still struggle sometimes.\n\nI'll teach you my tips and tricks in this full length live yoga video about practicing them safely. Remember, if you have any injuries in your back, shoulders or wrists, handstands aren't for you right now. If you're on your monthly cycle, or; if you have glaucoma, uncontrolled blood pressure, or had a recent surgery, skip the handstand part. Put your legs up against a wall instead...you'll get great benefits as you take care of yourself.\n\nHere are some steps to practicing handstands:\n1. Put on some comfy clothes, grab your yoga mat, blocks and strap.\n2. Clear away a space to practice yoga that includes access to a wall.\n3. Do your best and let go of any expectations.\n\nRemember, handstands are challenging. It doesn't matter if you get into one or not. If just matters that you keep your breath steady while giving it your best effort. When you focus on your breath and best effort, you mind will become quieter and you'll feel strong and connected.\n\nHelp me make more hour-long yoga videos by becoming a Patreon member!

When you're healthy and strong, you can support and help others along the way.\n\nWhen you don't practice yoga, you don't feel as well.\n\nWith regular practice you'll be healthy and strong.

My yoga videos are to keep you strong and healthy. My mission is to surround you with a supportive Fightmaster Yoga community.\n\nHandstands are difficult and can be scary to attempt whether it's in a live yoga class or not. You've seen beautiful photos or yoga videos of others doing handstands. You might be thinking, \"why can't I do it?\" \"What's wrong with me?!?\"\n\nBut, the truth is that doing a handstand isn't the \"goal\" of this free yoga video because yoga is never about the pose.\n\nI know handstands are difficult. I've been practicing them for years and still struggle sometimes.\n\nI'll teach you my tips and tricks in this full length live yoga video about practicing them safely. Remember, if you have any injuries in your back, shoulders or wrists, handstands aren't for you right now. If you're on your monthly cycle, or; if you have glaucoma, uncontrolled blood pressure, or had a recent surgery, skip the handstand part. Put your legs up against a wall instead...you'll get great benefits as you take care of yourself.\n\nHere are some steps to practicing handstands:\n1. Put on some comfy clothes, grab your yoga mat, blocks and strap.\n2. Clear away a space to practice yoga that includes access to a wall.\n3. Do your best and let go of any expectations.\n\nRemember, handstands are challenging. It doesn't matter if you get into one or not. If just matters that you keep your breath steady while giving it your best effort. When you focus on your breath and best effort, you mind will become quieter and you'll feel strong and connected.\n\nHelp me make more hour-long yoga videos by becoming a Patreon member!

                "description": "20 Minute Morning Yoga Flow (AM For Energy) is a great way to start the AM of the day. So energizing yoga for morning is here for you! We'll begin this YouTube yoga class seated, to settle into our morning yoga practice and we'll start with a breathing practice (kabalabhati breath). Remember, when practicing kabalabhati breath, the inhales are passive and the exhales are more pronounced and forceful through the nose. Do remember to inhale though! If you don't, you'll run out of breath. I heard someone describe this type of breathing practice as blowing a candle out through the nose. We'll practice 3 rounds of this breath and it's great for warming the body up and for increasing energy throughout the body. Next we'll begin moving, slowly warming up and getting the body ready to (yoga) flow. We add yoga standing poses like warrior 2, reverse warrior and side angle. These standing yoga postures help to strengthen and stretch the legs and hips. If you happen to sit a lot (at a desk, in a car, etc...like most of us),  practicing these standing yoga poses help to keep the body flexible and strong. Next we'll come into a dynamic variation of twisted triangle / wide legged forward fold twist. Twisting is great anytime but in the morning there's added benefit to get the digestion \"moving.' After the standing posture, we begin some yoga backbends or extension of the spine. These postures will really increase and move your energy throughout your body, so enjoy. After our backbends, we'll unwind with some forward folds and gentle twists to re-balance the spine. Then our final resting poses...savasana to help you relax this morning. Try to stick with your whole savasana because it's sooooo important to integrate your whole morning yoga practice. Most importantly, have a great morning and day! :-)\n\nIf you want to get a daily inspirational email from me and a free core class click here https://www.myyogapal.com/core-sign-up\n\nWe Would Love To Have YOU As A Part Of Our Intro\nEmail fightmasteryogaintro@gmail.com your horizontal clip saying \"Hi I'm __ from __ and your practicing Fightmaster Yoga\" to be featured \n\nFightmaster Yoga is made possible by the support of generous yogi's like you.

To prepare for this challenging vinyasa yoga posture, we must correctly warm up and educate our bodies. In this vinyasa flow, we do that by stretching the shoulders, upper back, and hip flexors. It's also important to keep the belly muscles engaged, the hip bones lifting toward the lower ribs and the sitting bones lengthening toward the backs of the knees as you spiral your inner thighs in toward each other.

Fightmaster yoga is the best place on youtube to find any yoga class that meets your needs. If you want to get strong and build more strength through yoga then this is your youtube go to yoga channel. If you want to find yoga for abs and core workouts then Fightmaster Yoga is the perfect fix. If you want to build flexibility you are in the right place. We deliver free youtube yoga videos every Monday. Remember to subscribe to the Fightmaster Yoga channel and hit the bell so you never miss a free full yoga vinyasa class. We have yoga videos of every length to fit into your schedule. Fightmaster yoga is the best place to develop a home yoga practice. We are also developing a new subscription app called yoga fix 30. Comment below what you would like to see on our Fightmaster yoga app. Thanks. Enjoy! Yoga for strength and flexibility with core focusing on the upper body. This free yoga video is 20 minutes and was made to help you create a healthy habit. A yoga fix. We'll begin with an affirmation to get you into the right mind-set for your practice. Affirmations are wonderful tools to help create positivity throughout your life and when used regularily, you'll absolutely notice a difference in how you feel. If you like this affirmation, or if you find any affirmations that really resonate with you. Take a moment to write them down and practice saying them and writing them 10 to 15 times per day. After the opening of our class, we'll warm up our shoulders and triceps. Next, we'll start to strengthen. You might find the triceps strengthening in reverse table (purvottanasana variation) to be challenging. I found it challenging as well! Always do the best you can and rest whenever you need to. Push the pause button! We'll move to table position next and practice some balance, as we practice stabilizing the core muscles and then we'll start to strengthen the core muscles as well. There are a lot of chatturanga push-ups in this class. If you find it to be too much, please practice them with your knees on the mat or hold plank position.

                "description": "1 Hour Total Body Yoga Workout (Vinyasa Flow to Bird Of Paradise). Today\u2019s free one hour total body yoga video will prepare you for this challenge posture Bird of Paradise. In order to be ready to attempt Bird of Paradise, we need to warm up and educate many parts of the body, including our shoulders, hips, hamstrings and core muscles (total body yoga). There\u2019s a slight twist in the yoga posture as well and we\u2019ll be practicing some twisting postures that will help to keep the pelvis and hips neutral and we twist the spine from above the waist. Balance is also a component of practicing Bird of Paradise. We\u2019ll start off balancing in tree pose and you\u2019re always welcome to practice tree instead of moving into Bird of Paradise if it seems too difficult in today's yoga practice. Remember, balance is different day to day. One day your balance will feel solid and stable, another day it will feel frustratingly impossible. Don\u2019t take it personally...most days it falls in between the two extremes. Yoga asanas or postures are a great way to keep your total body strong and flexible. When connected with your breath, your yoga practice helps to unblock energy in your body and increase the circulation so that your total body and mind stay healthy and active. Do your best and let go of any expectations about your yoga poses.

                    "description": "1 Hour Total Body Yoga Workout (Vinyasa Flow to Bird Of Paradise). Today\u2019s free one hour total body yoga video will prepare you for this challenge posture Bird of Paradise. In order to be ready to attempt Bird of Paradise, we need to warm up and educate many parts of the body, including our shoulders, hips, hamstrings and core muscles (total body yoga). There\u2019s a slight twist in the yoga posture as well and we\u2019ll be practicing some twisting postures that will help to keep the pelvis and hips neutral and we twist the spine from above the waist. Balance is also a component of practicing Bird of Paradise. We\u2019ll start off balancing in tree pose and you\u2019re always welcome to practice tree instead of moving into Bird of Paradise if it seems too difficult in today's yoga practice. Remember, balance is different day to day. One day your balance will feel solid and stable, another day it will feel frustratingly impossible. Don\u2019t take it personally...most days it falls in between the two extremes. Yoga asanas or postures are a great way to keep your total body strong and flexible. When connected with your breath, your yoga practice helps to unblock energy in your body and increase the circulation so that your total body and mind stay healthy and active. Do your best and let go of any expectations about your yoga poses.

                "description": "20 Minute Hatha Yoga (Heart Opening Flow Yoga). Today is a heart opening yoga flow. Welcome to day 30!! You did it!! If you weren't already addicted to yoga, I bet that you are now!! Congratulations on continuing to practice until the end! If it took you 30 days, that's great! If it took you 300 days to get here, that's awesome too! You did it and I'm so proud of you!  This vinyasa flow will focus on opening the upper back and stretching out the whole front of your body. When practicing any backbending posture, be sure to keep a slight internal rotation in your legs (as if you're holding a bock between your thighs), lengthen your butt bones toward the backs of your knees, draw your front bottom ribs down toward your waist, lift your back ribs up toward your head and widen your collarbones.

As we move through our standing poses today, be sure to keep your focus on your legs so that they're aligned and engaged. We'll make our way to to the floor as we practice some back strengthening back bends like salabhasana (locust pose) and dhanurasana (bow pose). Remember to keep your hip points lifting toward your lower ribs, your sitting bones lengthening toward the backs of your knees and lifting your inner thighs toward the ceiling. Also, lift your lower belly in and up.

You can expect some more Agni Sara pranayama practice...notice if it's a bit easier today...no judgement, just notice! Every day you're getting stronger. Some days you might feel it and other days you might not, but you are. We're also going to practice bakasana or crow pose. This is a fun arm balance that many people love, even though most of us find it super challenging. Remember, it doesn't matter if you're able to do the pose. The only thing that matters is giving it your best shot today. If you balance or not doesn't matter because when you try your best, your mind is focused and quiet and that's where we experience \"yoga.\" See you tomorrow!!!

                "description": "20 Minute Full Body Yoga Stretch (For an energizing Morning) is great to practice in the morning or really any time of day. It's a nice way to start, and end your day. It's short enough that you can do it before or after a workout. As we get into the holidays, it's nice to slow down a bit. Plus, it's \"mercury retrograde\" so sometimes we have to slow down even when we don't want to (if you've been experience communication issues, electrical or mechanical mishaps, Mercury may be to blame).

It's a nice way to start, and end your day. It's short enough that you can do it before or after a workout. As we get into the holidays, it's nice to slow down a bit. Plus, it's \"mercury retrograde\" so sometimes we have to slow down even when we don't want to (if you've been experience communication issues, electrical or mechanical mishaps, Mercury may be to blame).

If it's not your birthday today, then happy un-birthday...either way, let's practice some yoga together. We happened to film this video on my birthday, so thank you for sharing my birthday with me! We'll focus on inversions because as we celebrate our journeys around the sun, our bodies become more and more affected by gravity. Inversions help us to counter those effects (like spinal compression, etc). Any yoga pose or posture where the head is lower than the heart is considered an inversion, so get ready for lots of forward folds, downward dogs and maybe even a handstand or two!\n\n\nTo support Fightmaster yoga: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=VNCTTYTH5MX2C\n\nFor Amazon purchases please use this link http://www.amazon.com/?tag=fightyoga-20\n\nPlease subscribe! http://bit.ly/1mzfCpl\n\nAll your strength comes from the core.

If it's not your birthday today, then happy un-birthday...either way, let's practice some yoga together. We happened to film this video on my birthday, so thank you for sharing my birthday with me! We'll focus on inversions because as we celebrate our journeys around the sun, our bodies become more and more affected by gravity. Inversions help us to counter those effects (like spinal compression, etc). Any yoga pose or posture where the head is lower than the heart is considered an inversion, so get ready for lots of forward folds, downward dogs and maybe even a handstand or two!\n\n\nTo support Fightmaster yoga: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=VNCTTYTH5MX2C\n\nFor Amazon purchases please use this link http://www.amazon.com/?tag=fightyoga-20\n\nPlease subscribe! http://bit.ly/1mzfCpl\n\nAll your strength comes from the core.

Sitting causes the hip flexor muscles to shorten and many people experience the lower back over-arching (moving the pelvis into an anterior tilt) which causes lower back pain.

                "description": "40 Minutes Hatha Yoga Happiness: Never take anyone personally Day 10. Today's topic/tool is to never take anyone personally. Many times we react to other people's issues when there's absolutely no need. We all have pain inside of us. Sometimes, someone will come along and trigger it with words, or a look or actions. If we didn't have that pain already within us, the situation wouldn't even bother us and the same it true for others. They have the pain of an old wound within them and we say or do something to trigger it. They lash out at us, but unless we're deliberately trying to be hurtful, the situation really isn't about us at all and there's no reason to take it personally or to be hurt.

                    "description": "40 Minutes Hatha Yoga Happiness: Never take anyone personally Day 10. Today's topic/tool is to never take anyone personally. Many times we react to other people's issues when there's absolutely no need. We all have pain inside of us. Sometimes, someone will come along and trigger it with words, or a look or actions. If we didn't have that pain already within us, the situation wouldn't even bother us and the same it true for others. They have the pain of an old wound within them and we say or do something to trigger it. They lash out at us, but unless we're deliberately trying to be hurtful, the situation really isn't about us at all and there's no reason to take it personally or to be hurt.

Each class is designed to enhance the lecture on the poses that we're studying but the classes are also well-rounded. We'll begin with  the heart of the practice, the breath and then we'll practice the \"blueprint\" pose for all of our standing poses, Tadasana or Mountain Pose.  Next, we'll breakdown and practice warror 2, triangle pose, half moon pose and tree pose. You'll learn all of the sanskrit names for the poses as well. We will practice and learn the components to Surya A and B (Sun Salutations). There is a full section on inversions including handstands, headstands and forearm balance as well as shoulderstand.  We'll also look at and practice some arm balances.  The course is like a mini-teacher training! I'll be sharing with you tons information that I've learned and taught as a teacher trainer!!\n\nHere's what students are saying about the course:\n\"Just wanted to say how much I'm enjoying your course Lesley it's invaluable for someone like me who practices using your YouTube videos at home without an instructor. It's giving me a lot more confidence in making sure I am aligned properly. So much gratitude.\"\n-Kathleen O.\n\nEllie:  I'm really enjoying the course. I'm learning a lot and hopefully adjusting some old bad habits that I have acquired along the way. Finding that I don't have to square my hips has made some poses far more accessible and much less of a struggle. A shorter stance in trikonasana has made it easier to place the weight more in my big toe, something I always struggled to understand or do before. The videos are paced really well for me, I can digest the information at the same time as practicing. I'm eager to keep learning more about alignment which may explain why I'm going through the videos quickly. \n\nMohammed R.: \u201cLesley is an amazing teacher I have learnt yoga thru her youtube channel and to get deeper I have joined this course so far I have enjoyed every moment of being a good student. I would highly recommend it to anyone\"\n\nThe course is designed for everyone, but if you're a beginner, please don't attempt the more difficult postures until you feel that you're ready.

It's not intended for beginners.  This class was made for intermediate and advanced yoga practitioners who want to practice a led Ashtanga Class in their own home.  The method is based on the teachings of Sri K. Pattabhi Jois where the Vinyasas are counted in Sanskrit and the names of the poses are also in Sanskrit.  The breath count is included as well but there isn't much instruction on how to practice the poses as this practice is meant to be a moving meditation without many distractions. If you're newer to Ashtanga, please start with either the 30-minute: https://youtu.be/vBaQlOq1KoU or the 60-minute practice: https://youtu.be/2wYN1IhnXT4\nPlease visit fightmasteryoga.com and join our new email list. :-)\n\nPlease donate and help us on our mission to offer free yoga to as many people around the world as possible: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=VNCTTYTH5MX2C\nBecause we believe that yoga helps to make the world a better place.\n\nPlease subscribe! http://bit.ly/1mzfCpl\n\nYou need a BREAK, so join me on a retreat!

It's not intended for beginners.  This class was made for intermediate and advanced yoga practitioners who want to practice a led Ashtanga Class in their own home.  The method is based on the teachings of Sri K. Pattabhi Jois where the Vinyasas are counted in Sanskrit and the names of the poses are also in Sanskrit.  The breath count is included as well but there isn't much instruction on how to practice the poses as this practice is meant to be a moving meditation without many distractions. If you're newer to Ashtanga, please start with either the 30-minute: https://youtu.be/vBaQlOq1KoU or the 60-minute practice: https://youtu.be/2wYN1IhnXT4\nPlease visit fightmasteryoga.com and join our new email list. :-)\n\nPlease donate and help us on our mission to offer free yoga to as many people around the world as possible: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=VNCTTYTH5MX2C\nBecause we believe that yoga helps to make the world a better place.\n\nPlease subscribe! http://bit.ly/1mzfCpl\n\nYou need a BREAK, so join me on a retreat!

                "description": "Vinyasa Flow Yoga for Stress Relief: Yin and Yang is a 40 minute class for everyone.  Just in time for the holiday season to help us let go of stress.  This can be a difficult time of year for many.  This class starts with a \"Yang\" practice which heats up the body.  Yang is associated with heat and light.  It is male-dominated energy according to Chinese philosophy.  Much of our world seems to be Yang dominant.  Where I live in Southern California, there is so much Yang energy.  A lot of competition to succeed...to \"keep up with the Joneses\" and to work, work, work.  This creates stress for many.  Our bodies spend way too much time in the \"fight or flight\" mode which wreaks havoc on our physical and emotional systems.  Yin is the feminine passive energy associated with cold and darkness.  It is a calming energy that allows us to relax and renew ourselves.  Yin is as important as Yang and we need both in order to find balance in our lives and in our bodies and minds.\n\nI highly recommend reading \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho.  It's a wonderful \"hero's journey\" that describes the importance of following your heart's desire, or dream, or \"Personal Legend.\"  It's so important to follow your heart to find your \"Dharma\" or what you were meant to do with your life.  By following this, we all add love to the world. \nTo check out \"The Alchemist\" on Amazon:  \ngoo.gl/iJ36er Thank you for your support!! :-)\n\n\nFor information on upcoming yoga retreats, please email me: lesleyfightmaster@gmail.com  Scheduled are a women's retreat in Isla Mujares (off the coast of cancun) February 19--25.   Also co-ed retreats in Sedona, AZ in April 2015 and Ojai, CA in August, 2015\n\nFor information on Teacher Trainings, please email me: lesleyfightmaster@gmail.com\n\nPlease donate if you can!

                    "description": "Vinyasa Flow Yoga for Stress Relief: Yin and Yang is a 40 minute class for everyone.  Just in time for the holiday season to help us let go of stress.  This can be a difficult time of year for many.  This class starts with a \"Yang\" practice which heats up the body.  Yang is associated with heat and light.  It is male-dominated energy according to Chinese philosophy.  Much of our world seems to be Yang dominant.  Where I live in Southern California, there is so much Yang energy.  A lot of competition to succeed...to \"keep up with the Joneses\" and to work, work, work.  This creates stress for many.  Our bodies spend way too much time in the \"fight or flight\" mode which wreaks havoc on our physical and emotional systems.  Yin is the feminine passive energy associated with cold and darkness.  It is a calming energy that allows us to relax and renew ourselves.  Yin is as important as Yang and we need both in order to find balance in our lives and in our bodies and minds.\n\nI highly recommend reading \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho.  It's a wonderful \"hero's journey\" that describes the importance of following your heart's desire, or dream, or \"Personal Legend.\"  It's so important to follow your heart to find your \"Dharma\" or what you were meant to do with your life.  By following this, we all add love to the world. \nTo check out \"The Alchemist\" on Amazon:  \ngoo.gl/iJ36er Thank you for your support!! :-)\n\n\nFor information on upcoming yoga retreats, please email me: lesleyfightmaster@gmail.com  Scheduled are a women's retreat in Isla Mujares (off the coast of cancun) February 19--25.

Twists are great to help keep our spine healthy and lubricated and to help aid in proper digestion.  Always remember to inhale and lengthen your spine first, before exhaling into the twist.  Twists should be performed above the waist while keeping the hips and pelvis neutral.  By keeping the pelvis stable and neutral, we'll avoid the tendency to \"crank\" the lower back into the twist.

                "description": "30 minute Vinyasa Yoga Overhand Grip in Dhanurasana (Bow) pose with Shireen Kaviani.  This is an intermediate to advanced class leading to Padanguthasana Dhanuransana.  Shireen does a beautiful job with this difficult variation of Dhanurasana.  In order to get into this pose, the shoulders, upper back and hip flexors need to be warmed up.  Please pay attention to your body.  The full pose is advanced.  If it isn't available to you today, stay with regular bow pose.  Stop if you experience any pain.  Shireen has a beautiful practice and she's very flexible, so she makes it look easy.  I have tightness in my shoulders which makes this pose really difficult for me.  It's a pose that I don't practice very much because if I don't get my shoulders and hip flexors open enough, my lower back gets too compressed...ouch!! This is why we get to see our lovely Shireen practice this pose! \n\nAs always, work at your own pace, rest if you need to rest and stop if you experience any pain.

                    "description": "30 minute Vinyasa Yoga Overhand Grip in Dhanurasana (Bow) pose with Shireen Kaviani.  This is an intermediate to advanced class leading to Padanguthasana Dhanuransana.  Shireen does a beautiful job with this difficult variation of Dhanurasana.  In order to get into this pose, the shoulders, upper back and hip flexors need to be warmed up.  Please pay attention to your body.  The full pose is advanced.  If it isn't available to you today, stay with regular bow pose.  Stop if you experience any pain.  Shireen has a beautiful practice and she's very flexible, so she makes it look easy.  I have tightness in my shoulders which makes this pose really difficult for me.  It's a pose that I don't practice very much because if I don't get my shoulders and hip flexors open enough, my lower back gets too compressed...ouch!! This is why we get to see our lovely Shireen practice this pose! \n\nAs always, work at your own pace, rest if you need to rest and stop if you experience any pain. Please like and share this class if you enjoy it! Thank you for all of your support!! I love our \"Fightmaster Yoga\" community.
