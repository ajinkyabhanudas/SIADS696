And, this is something you want to uncover, to be fully you.\n\nThere are a few things every super hero knows and embodies. A real hero knows how to be truly strong, while a pretend hero flexes and puts on a show of strength. A real hero knows how to be movable, while a pretend hero tries control every moment. A real hero knows how to be at ease, especially when things get tough, while a pretend hero depletes themselves by going to war with challenge before the challenge even begins.\n\nThis practice gives you a way to make these qualities real in your life. And along the way it uncovers who you truly are, who you are meant to be. A super hero in your whole self.\n\nAnd of course if you're pregnant, and for everyone, please always check with your doctor first.
