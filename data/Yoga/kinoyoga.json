Let me know how it goes. Help us spread the word as we get close to 3,000 yogis!!\n\n_ \nWhat I learned on my journey to #bestrong changed my life. Yeah, it was fun to learn to balance upside down, but the real transformation happened internally. When I took the lessons off the mat into everyday life,  I started to reap the rewards of all the effort I put in on the mat. That\u2019s what it\u2019s really about\u2014using the experience of life in the poses to make you a better person when you\u2019re living your life off the mat.\n_\nLessons to learn in Dolphin and Pinchamayurasana\u2014\n1. The long view\u2014Be willing to put in whatever it takes, for however long it takes, no matter how long it takes. Commit yourself to a 100 year journey and stay the course\n2. It\u2019s not over when you think it\u2019s over. It\u2019s not over when you\u2019re tired or sore or bored or frustrated. It\u2019s not over when you want it to be over. It\u2019s over when it\u2019s over, and in the meanwhile all you can do is keep trying and never give up.\n2. Fall 1,000 times, get up 1,001 times. No matter how many times you tumble out of yo Pincha attempts, get back up, dust yourself off and try again. You\u2019ll learn how to build unshakable faith and determination.\n3. Just try\u2014don\u2019t judge your worthiness as a human being by what shapes you make. Learn to value the effort and have fun trying. \n4. Fail\u2014be willing to fail properly rather than fake succeed. That means if you\u2019re compromising your form to get up for a quick second, it\u2019s better to stay down and focus on good alignment and technique.\n_\n\nOutfit is one of my favorite bikini designs by @liquidoactive \n#practiceyogachangeyourworld\n#onebreathatatime \ud83d\ude4f\n_\nNext workshops\u2014\nUtah\nAlabama \nToronto\nShanghai \nBeijing \ud83d\udc97\n_\nEnd of year sale for just $5 for new students to join @omstarsofficial Only 48 hours left!!\n\ud83c\udf1f",

Let me know how it goes. Help us spread the word as we get close to 3,000 yogis!!\n\n_ \nWhat I learned on my journey to #bestrong changed my life. Yeah, it was fun to learn to balance upside down, but the real transformation happened internally. When I took the lessons off the mat into everyday life,  I started to reap the rewards of all the effort I put in on the mat. That\u2019s what it\u2019s really about\u2014using the experience of life in the poses to make you a better person when you\u2019re living your life off the mat.\n_\nLessons to learn in Dolphin and Pinchamayurasana\u2014\n1. The long view\u2014Be willing to put in whatever it takes, for however long it takes, no matter how long it takes. Commit yourself to a 100 year journey and stay the course\n2. It\u2019s not over when you think it\u2019s over. It\u2019s not over when you\u2019re tired or sore or bored or frustrated. It\u2019s not over when you want it to be over. It\u2019s over when it\u2019s over, and in the meanwhile all you can do is keep trying and never give up.\n2. Fall 1,000 times, get up 1,001 times. No matter how many times you tumble out of yo Pincha attempts, get back up, dust yourself off and try again. You\u2019ll learn how to build unshakable faith and determination.\n3. Just try\u2014don\u2019t judge your worthiness as a human being by what shapes you make. Learn to value the effort and have fun trying. \n4. Fail\u2014be willing to fail properly rather than fake succeed. That means if you\u2019re compromising your form to get up for a quick second, it\u2019s better to stay down and focus on good alignment and technique.\n_\n\nOutfit is one of my favorite bikini designs by @liquidoactive \n#practiceyogachangeyourworld\n#onebreathatatime \ud83d\ude4f\n_\nNext workshops\u2014\nUtah\nAlabama \nToronto\nShanghai \nBeijing \ud83d\udc97\n_\nEnd of year sale for just $5 for new students to join @omstarsofficial Only 48 hours left!!\n\ud83c\udf1f"

I kicked up with so much force that there was no option other than to land all the way over in a backbend. Seeing as I didn\u2019t hurt myself, but confused as to why I wasn\u2019t in a headstand, I tried again. And again. And again. A year later I managed to find a balance.\n\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/KinoYoga\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/KinoYoga\nBlog - http://www.kinoyoga.com"

Join HERE:\nhttps://omstars.com/challenges/handstandmechanics\n\nThis yoga challenge pairs with my all-new 14 class course on OMstars.com that breaks down the basics of handstands, starting from the foundational strength work and building up to handstand press. Whether you feel like you\u2019ll never be able to do a handstand or you\u2019re looking to refine your handstand skills this course is for you. Yoga is not a game of extreme ableism, and yet it\u2019s fun to try challenging poses like handstands because they teach you something about yourself. It\u2019s not about perfection, it\u2019s about being strong enough to find a little piece of wisdom and humility with every breath. You learn physical skills, but the real journey is always inward. It doesn\u2019t matter if you ever hold a perfect handstand, it only matters that you expand your heart when you try. Click the link in my bio to join my all new handstand course on www.omstars.com\n\nThe BEST part is that this course is a FREE #yogachallenge for charity starting July 1st. With the help of our awesome sponsor MiiR we can raise up to $15,000 for Splash and help bring clean water to Nepalese villages. \n\nI\u2019ve always said that we can practice yoga and change the world. Now, you can play an active role in that just by getting on your mat and practicing handstands with me!

                    "description": "Are you ready for #HandstandMechanics FREE yoga challenge? Join HERE:\nhttps://omstars.com/challenges/handstandmechanics\n\nThis yoga challenge pairs with my all-new 14 class course on OMstars.com that breaks down the basics of handstands, starting from the foundational strength work and building up to handstand press. Whether you feel like you\u2019ll never be able to do a handstand or you\u2019re looking to refine your handstand skills this course is for you. Yoga is not a game of extreme ableism, and yet it\u2019s fun to try challenging poses like handstands because they teach you something about yourself. It\u2019s not about perfection, it\u2019s about being strong enough to find a little piece of wisdom and humility with every breath. You learn physical skills, but the real journey is always inward. It doesn\u2019t matter if you ever hold a perfect handstand, it only matters that you expand your heart when you try. Click the link in my bio to join my all new handstand course on www.omstars.com\n\nThe BEST part is that this course is a FREE #yogachallenge for charity starting July 1st. With the help of our awesome sponsor MiiR we can raise up to $15,000 for Splash and help bring clean water to Nepalese villages. \n\nI\u2019ve always said that we can practice yoga and change the world. Now, you can play an active role in that just by getting on your mat and practicing handstands with me!

A lightbulb went off in my head: what if there was Netflix for yogis? The first thing I did was text my best friend, Kerri, and ask if she wanted to build this dream with me. When she said \u2018yes\u2019 we started the two year process of putting it all together. Now after countless hours of work, that dream is now a reality.\n\nAll those years falling out of handstands and picking myself back up to try again gave me the perseverance, determination and strength to stay the course to build this dream. And now we are so excited to share our dream with you--OmStars. And with your help we are going to make this dream come true!\n\nOmStars is the world's first yoga channel with content created for yogis by yogis. All our content is organized into seasons and courses. We developed four categories of content: practice where you get to practice with us, insight where you get to study with us, wellness where you get to learn balanced living and diet, and culture where you get to play, have fun and travel the world with us. Our platform has a unique practice tracker that logs practice hours which convert into reward points to incentivize your practice and create accountability. We have hundreds of classes that need to be edited. We need a team of editors, TV filming and production equipment, an office space and to finish our website.\n\nWe can only do this with your support. Please click the link get behind this project today. You can choose some of our awesome rewards or you can even pledge without a reward.\n\nWe have been blown away by the positive response for our community--you! And now is the time for action to make this all come to fruition. Remember, projects that are well funded within the first 24 hours have a 10x greater likelihood of succeeding. Will you pledge today?\n\nAfter you get involved, I'd love for you to share the campaign on your social media and tell everyone about it!

This deep present lunge will unlock your hips and psoas and give you access to your lower back. One of the most common reason people feel crunching sensations in the lower back in backbends is because they haven't taken the time to fully open the hips and release the psoas. If the front of the hip is tight it will literally pull the joints of the lumbar vertebrae down and create a feeling of compression. Use today's class to really dig deeply into the inner space of the pelvis. As an extra challenge the class ends with Natarajasana, in its easiest form.

Big congrats!!! \n\nToday's practice builds up to Parsvakonasana, Extended Side Angle. But first, ask yourself this: what is yoga? What does it mean to be a yogi? Patience, tolerance, kindness, gentleness, peace and humility are the qualities of a yogi's heart. Look inside and see you can find those seeds within. Look around at your world and see if you can see the fruits of your practice around you. \ud83d\ude4f\n.\n\nThe physical part is only one portion of the yoga journey. For Parsvakonasana you need strong legs, a strong core, good hip rotation and external rotation of the shoulders. You have all the tools by now so put it all together in this sequence for a complete practice. And with each practice you will be nurturing the seeds of a more peaceful life, one breath at a time.\n\nWelcome to this One Month Beginner Yoga Challenge.

Big congrats!!! \n\nToday's practice builds up to Parsvakonasana, Extended Side Angle. But first, ask yourself this: what is yoga? What does it mean to be a yogi? Patience, tolerance, kindness, gentleness, peace and humility are the qualities of a yogi's heart. Look inside and see you can find those seeds within. Look around at your world and see if you can see the fruits of your practice around you. \ud83d\ude4f\n.\n\nThe physical part is only one portion of the yoga journey. For Parsvakonasana you need strong legs, a strong core, good hip rotation and external rotation of the shoulders. You have all the tools by now so put it all together in this sequence for a complete practice. And with each practice you will be nurturing the seeds of a more peaceful life, one breath at a time.\n\nWelcome to this One Month Beginner Yoga Challenge. New videos will be posted daily at 9 AM EST during the month of May. Pair these videos perfectly with #MayIBeginYoga2016 to support your daily practice and share on Instagram. Videos will publish on the day before the calendar date to give you time to practice and post on IG. Subscribe, comment, like and share to stay involved in the yoga challenge. \n\nWe designed this month\u2019s challenge to be the perfect introduction to yoga, just like a 30 Day Yoga Course, but we want ALL levels to join and share their practice. This is the same challenge as last year so it's perfect for those who participated to see how far you've come!\n\nBlog, Events and News - http://www.kinoyoga.com\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/KinoYoga\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/KinoYoga\nLive Broadcasts - http://www.periscope.tv/kinoyoga\nSnapchat - KinoYoga"

As a beginner it's important to learn how to try things that you will not succeed at on the first try and then develop the emotional, spiritual and mental fortitude to try anyway and accept the long road of the journey of yoga. You will succeed one day with patient, sustained effort and in the meanwhile you will learn how to be strong, how to love your perfectly imperfect self and be gentle and kind to yourself along the way. If it's all easy from the first breath then you have nowhere to challenge yourself to grow from.\n\nForward bends are deep cleansing poses. As you draw the lower belly in and create emptiness in the pelvic bowl you will be move through a detox and cleanse of the body's digestive system. Take your time! Focus on the technique.

Arm balances are challenging and you might feel like you just want to quit, but remember that yoga is a personal practice and you never get \"there\".

Start your yoga journey off with this basic instructional video and practice based around Downward Facing Dog. Called Addho Muka Svanasana in Sanskrit, Downward Facing Dog is one of the more foundational yoga poses. Used in the Sun Salutations and in the transitions of most seated poses, setting yourself up for good alignment in Downward Facing stretches and strengthens the shoulders, releases the back and gives you access to a deeper forward fold and hip flexion. \n\nWe designed this month\u2019s challenge to be the perfect introduction to yoga, just like a 30 Day Yoga Course, but we want ALL levels to join and share their practice. This is the same challenge as last year so it's perfect for those who participated to see how far you've come!\n\nBlog, Events and News - http://www.kinoyoga.com\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/KinoYoga\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/KinoYoga\nLive Broadcasts - http://www.periscope.tv/kinoyoga\nSnapchat - KinoYoga"
