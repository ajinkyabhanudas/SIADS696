This is because the space created each day only becomes stronger and more clear over time, and therefore more valuable for you to come back to yourself each time, strengthen your conscious focus, and then continue on with clarity and momentum into all that needs to be done in the day ahead. \n\nMay you have the best day that you deserve. \n\nLove & Light....\n\n\nInstructor- Mark Spicoluk\nLocation- Rio Perdido, Costa  https://www.rioperdido.com\n\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\n\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App\nhttps://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now!\nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here!\nhttps://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat\nhttps://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\n#BohoBeautiful #morningmeditation #meditation\n\nBoho Beautiful is Juliana Spicoluk & Mark Spicoluk\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBoho Beautiful Yoga is a yoga fitness lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

There is a innate balance that will slowly reveal itself to you. Do not force anything. Just let it all come forward and find stillness inside of it.

This easy and gentle yin yoga practice is a beautiful way to deeply stretch your body after a long day, or help let go of any stress and negative energy that may be stored within you. \n\nThis slow and restorative yin yoga practice will not only release physical soreness and stiffness but also welcome any release of emotional and mental stress that you may be holding within the hips and lower body. It's important to surrender to each yin yoga posture and accept any type of emotional release that may come your way.

How do I hold my planks without wrist pain? \n\nA lot of the time people experience wrist pain in planks, downward dogs, chaturangas, or just generally when bearing a lot of body weight on their hands. There are ways to cope with this wrist pain by using different wrist strengthening exercises, and wrists stretching movements and postures. \n\nTry to include these different wrist pain solutions before or after your yoga practice and/or workouts. With time and patience the pain will get less as the body gets stronger. \n\nWe took 10 minutes on set of our new program Boho Beautiful Retreat (http://www.bohobeautiful.life/retreat) and answered some of your questions and concerns about everything to do with wrist pain and how to manage it. \n\nOur New Boho Beautiful Retreat Program: https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat/\n\nNew Full Length Fitness Program: https://bohobeautiful.life/transform/\n\n#BohoBeautiful #yoga #wristpain\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

                "description": "This new year 2020 is a perfect opportunity to set your dreams, visions, and goals back up and in the direction you want. For the last seven years we have been implementing one strategy to take back control of our lives which at the beginning of this wild ride together, seemed so far out of step with what we really wanted from our life. \n\nBut it's not a race. It's clarity. It's creating a map. And every day checking back in on whether or not you are still on course, and then making slight adjustments always. Getting where or what you want out of life, and becoming the person you believe you can be, is a quiet and slow process of many steps. And it is a constant battle with falling down or out of step, understanding it to be a part of the journey, and then recognizing the changes to your behaviour you have to make to get back on track again. Acceptance, forgiveness, perseverance, and most of all: grace. \n\nThat's why every new year we create a vision board.  Also known as a dream board, this single one strategy has allowed us to slowly and methodically design a life and a design for ourselves as people that we are proud to constantly be walking towards. It's not magic. There is no secret. And it takes intense amounts of patience, belief, and determination. \n\nBut most of all after this many years I think the most important idea is that we have found a deep surrender to the process... because the process is the journey... and if you get too comfortable the journey can so easily take control of you, so once in a while you have to spend a little time remembering where it is you want to go, so that you can take back control of it. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful is a yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

Simply surrender to the idea that you are exactly where you are supposed to be, and that with time, patience, dedication, and hard work your body will naturally respond and increase in flexibility, strength, and fluidity.\n\nSo roll out that mat and have fun. \n\nNamaste xx\n\nJuliana \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\nLocation: Tibet \n#Yoga #BohoBeautiful #YogaForAllLevels #YogaToStretchTheBody\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

Simply surrender to the idea that you are exactly where you are supposed to be, and that with time, patience, dedication, and hard work your body will naturally respond and increase in flexibility, strength, stamina, and endurance. \n\nSo roll out that mat. Work hard and have fun. \n\nNamaste xx\n\nYoga Instructor: Juliana Spicoluk\nVideo Creator: Mark Spicoluk\n\nLocation: Mardi Himal Trek, Nepal \n#Yoga #BohoBeautiful #MorningYoga #YogaToToneTheBody\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n* Boho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

                "description": "We found a beautiful way to spend less travelling and acquire more. Not more in experience, but more in depth. Nepal backpack travel offers so many unique ways to experience the incredible culture, mountains, trekking, and the overall Nepalese way of life. So we decided to start our backpacking Asia trip by bringing our lives to a screeching halt and committing 10 days to a Tibetan Buddhist Monastery. Our lives sometimes seem out of control. All about our devices, all about our channel, all about focussing away from ourselves and too much towards things that have unconsciously sucked us in... so every now and then we have to do something to stop and find the reset button. To breathe and to look inside again, and see what is left to be discovered. And there is always so much. \n\nSo there we were. At Kopan Monastery living, eating, and meditatiting with all the other students, and  hundreds of Tibetan monks while taking a Discovering Buddhism Course. What a wild, deep, and meaningful experience. \n\nAt times it was tough... structured religion and dogmatic plausible contractictions.  And at other times it was perspective altering and incredibly valuable to our own spirituality. Just like anything in life, we took what we needed from this wonderful experience of monk life. We discovered the fundamentals of Tibetan Buddhism that placed a lot of life into a beautiful perspective. We cried, we laughed, we were challenged, and we overcame it everything that was brought forward to learn a little bit more of what our Boho Beautiful life is all about. \n\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n#travelNepal #digitalnomads #BohoBeautiful #travelbloggers\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

How our appearance, the way we look, the way we dress, the job we hold, all of these and more create this identity that we tend to become attached to. An attachment that later on begins to bring anxiety and stress into our life as we begin to witness this body of ours change. And that's the thing, change....the undeniable truth that each and everyone one of us will encounter. The more we realize that we are not these bodies, that we are not these avatars that we create, but that we are so much greater than our surface. We are energy that was energy before we came into this life and consciousness, and we are the energy that will remain after our eventual end. Once we truly accept that, maybe we can realize that life is just play and that this beautiful existence is simply just one incredible dance and experience in itself. \n\n#hairtutorial #hairhacks #hairvideo\n lol. smh.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

How our appearance, the way we look, the way we dress, the job we hold, all of these and more create this identity that we tend to become attached to. An attachment that later on begins to bring anxiety and stress into our life as we begin to witness this body of ours change. And that's the thing, change....the undeniable truth that each and everyone one of us will encounter. The more we realize that we are not these bodies, that we are not these avatars that we create, but that we are so much greater than our surface. We are energy that was energy before we came into this life and consciousness, and we are the energy that will remain after our eventual end. Once we truly accept that, maybe we can realize that life is just play and that this beautiful existence is simply just one incredible dance and experience in itself. \n\n#hairtutorial #hairhacks #hairvideo\n lol. smh.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

Enjoy and breathe. \n\nLove & Light...\nJuliana & Mark**\n\nVideo Location: Lumeria Wellness Retreat (Maui, Hawaii)\nhttps://lumeriamaui.com \n\n#BohoBeautiful #YogaForBackPain #BeginnerYoga\n\nIf you enjoy this easy flow, feel free to check out some of our other beginner easy flow classes to help you get into that super relaxed and calm state of mind: \n\nPerfect Morning Yoga \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA6vjBPlmCE\n\nYin Yoga For Flexibility  \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IeS84sb3ZQ\n\nYoga For All Levels \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BQH1-tG61A\n\nYoga For Digestion \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdcmIkFCzfI\n\nMusic By: Michael FK.  \n\u25cf Youtube \u25b8 http://www.youtube.com/michaelfk\n\u25cf Spotify \u25b8 http://smarturl.it/MichaelFKSpotify\n\u25cf AppleMusic  \u25b8  http://smarturl.it/MichaelFKAppleMusic\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

This slow and restorative yin yoga practice will not only release physical soreness and stiffness but also welcome any release of emotional and mental stress that you may be holding within the hip area of your body. It's important to surrender to each yin yoga posture and accept any type of emotional release that may come your way. Be patient with your body and let go. \n\nRemember, breathing is a very important factor in any Yin Yoga class so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out.

Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nYin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:\n\n-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body\n-Stress and anxiety reduction\n-Increased circulation\n-Improved flexibility\n-Fascial release\n\nEnjoy and let go of all that no longer serves you,\n\nJuliana & Mark \n#BohoBeautiful #Yoga #YinYoga\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

It was such an eye opening experience to be immersed in the Peruvian Inca culture, to meet so many wonderful local people, and to hear their stories of how they truly feel about this commercial boom that has been steadily transforming their world. The exploitation of their sacred plant medicine which is now offered on almost every corner, Starbucks taking out the local coffee shops, McDonalds providing jobs but at the same time destroying other local restaurants, and so many foreign companies creeping their way in to siphon so many dollars away. All of this to serve the massive amount of growing travellers descending upon their sacred spaces.  \n\nSo what's the best way to travel in Peru? Or anywhere for that matter? How do you experience the Sacred Valley but at the same time not support the elimination of their culture by the commercialistic ways of the Western world? Should we all just stay at home? Is it better to leave it all be and read about our wonderful world only in Nat Geo? Is there a solution? \n\nWe believe there is. And not just abroad, but in our own communities too. Shop local wherever you go, support community businesses, contribute to the culture that you are surrounding yourself with. Vote with your dollars to keep them in the pockets of those who need it most. And realize that the world has so much to offer with its deep diversity and endless cultural beauty that taking a chance on something new is far more rewarding than the safe familiar road.

Focusing on deep hip opening yoga postures this class will allow you to release tension and stress that you've been holding within that area of your body as well as help you gain more flexibility in your hips and hamstrings. The perfect yoga class to paid with any of our Pilates workouts or your own personal workout programs. \n\n\nRemember, breathing is a very important factor in any Yin Yoga class so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make. \n\n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nEach posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1-2 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. \n\nYin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:\n\n-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body\n-Stress and anxiety reduction\n-Increased circulation\n-Improved flexibility\n-Fascial release\n\nEnjoy and let go of all that no longer serves you,\n\nJuliana & Mark \n#BohoBeautiful #Yoga #YinYoga\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

                    "description": "To Get The Full Program:\nhttp://www.bohobeautiful.life/complete/ \n\nThis Yin Yoga class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. Focusing on deep hip opening yoga postures this class will allow you to release tension and stress that you've been holding within that area of your body as well as help you gain more flexibility in your hips and hamstrings. The perfect yoga class to paid with any of our Pilates workouts or your own personal workout programs. \n\n\nRemember, breathing is a very important factor in any Yin Yoga class so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make. \n\n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nEach posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1-2 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. \n\nYin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:\n\n-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body\n-Stress and anxiety reduction\n-Increased circulation\n-Improved flexibility\n-Fascial release\n\nEnjoy and let go of all that no longer serves you,\n\nJuliana & Mark \n#BohoBeautiful #Yoga #YinYoga\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

We came into it with no idea of what to expect and were surprisingly blown away but the amazing energy that filled this entire festival. \n\nFrom the Envision Fest yoga classes, to the inspiring talks and speeches, amazing vegan food, their garbage program that leaves no waste behind after the festival is done, and of course our favourite Xavier Rudd. We hope that there will continue to be more festivals like this that raise the conciseness of the people, that provide gatherings for like minded people, and that honour the guiding divine light that leads us along our paths.

We came into it with no idea of what to expect and were surprisingly blown away but the amazing energy that filled this entire festival. \n\nFrom the Envision Fest yoga classes, to the inspiring talks and speeches, amazing vegan food, their garbage program that leaves no waste behind after the festival is done, and of course our favourite Xavier Rudd. We hope that there will continue to be more festivals like this that raise the conciseness of the people, that provide gatherings for like minded people, and that honour the guiding divine light that leads us along our paths. Thank you for this unforgettable time Envision Festival, we will be back!\n\n#BohoBeautiful #Envision #CostaRica\n\nMusic By: Medeuxa\nhttps://soundcloud.com/kill_medeuxa/broken-system\n(created- Mark Spicoluk & Anthony Cali)\n\n(Yoga Class Music) by DJ Chris Hawk \nhttps://m.mixcloud.com/chris-hawk/ \nhttps://www.instagram.com/therealchrishawk\n\nLuv Burger- https://www.luvburger.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/luv_burger\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

                "description": "This gentle Yin Yoga class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch and relaxation you need. This is a perfect yoga class to do after a long day at work or a stressful week. By using different yin yoga postures we will focus on releasing tension and stiffness out of the back and hips. Remember, breathing is a very important factor in Yin Yoga so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. This yin yoga class is great for beginners or anyone that is looking for something very gentle on the body.  You can even do this yoga class in bed if you like. \n \nDedicate this 20 minutes to yourself, because you deserve it! Put your own self care as a priority. Breathe, let go of all the negativity in your life, and welcome new positive and vibrant energy with every new breath. \n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles.

                    "description": "This gentle Yin Yoga class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch and relaxation you need. This is a perfect yoga class to do after a long day at work or a stressful week. By using different yin yoga postures we will focus on releasing tension and stiffness out of the back and hips. Remember, breathing is a very important factor in Yin Yoga so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. This yin yoga class is great for beginners or anyone that is looking for something very gentle on the body.  You can even do this yoga class in bed if you like. \n \nDedicate this 20 minutes to yourself, because you deserve it! Put your own self care as a priority. Breathe, let go of all the negativity in your life, and welcome new positive and vibrant energy with every new breath. \n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nEach posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture.

What you think about is what you become. And what you focus on regularly is what you will accomplish. So weather its a fitness or yoga goal, or a general better balance of health and wellness, or any type of dream or goal in your life... write it down, set your intention, and every day ask yourself what you can do to focus on one more small baby step to get you where you need to be. Each day is an inch in the journey, and in time the inches get easier, and eventually turn into feet and then miles. It won't be easy, but commit to the idea, write it down, and every day remind yourself again and again. Before you know it the results will give you momentum.

                "description": "To Get The Full Program:\nhttp://www.bohobeautiful.life/complete/\n\nThis 20 min Yin Yoga class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. By using different yin yoga postures we will focus on releasing tension and stiffness out of the upper back, hips, and glutes. Remember, breathing is a very important factor in Yin Yoga so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make.\n \nDedicate this 20 minutes to yourself, because you deserve it! Put your own self care as a priority. Breathe, let go of all the negativity in your life, and welcome new positive and vibrant energy with every new breath. \n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nEach posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. \n\nYin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:\n\n-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body\n-Stress and anxiety reduction\n-Increased circulation\n-Improved flexibility\n-Fascial release\n\n\nRelax, go deep, enjoy xo\n\nJuliana\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

                    "description": "To Get The Full Program:\nhttp://www.bohobeautiful.life/complete/\n\nThis 20 min Yin Yoga class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. By using different yin yoga postures we will focus on releasing tension and stiffness out of the upper back, hips, and glutes. Remember, breathing is a very important factor in Yin Yoga so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make.\n \nDedicate this 20 minutes to yourself, because you deserve it! Put your own self care as a priority. Breathe, let go of all the negativity in your life, and welcome new positive and vibrant energy with every new breath. \n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nEach posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. \n\nYin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:\n\n-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body\n-Stress and anxiety reduction\n-Increased circulation\n-Improved flexibility\n-Fascial release\n\n\nRelax, go deep, enjoy xo\n\nJuliana\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

                "description": "This Yin Yoga Flow class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. Focusing on fusing Vinyasa based flow (Yang) with slow and tension releasing postures (Yin), this class is great to do in morning as well as anytime during the day as we focus on first warming up the body with a flow, and then taking it into a deep release of the glutes and hamstrings. \n\nRemember, breathing is a very important factor in any Yin Yoga class so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make. \n\n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles.

                    "description": "This Yin Yoga Flow class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. Focusing on fusing Vinyasa based flow (Yang) with slow and tension releasing postures (Yin), this class is great to do in morning as well as anytime during the day as we focus on first warming up the body with a flow, and then taking it into a deep release of the glutes and hamstrings. \n\nRemember, breathing is a very important factor in any Yin Yoga class so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make. \n\n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nEach posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1-2 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture.

I eat a plant based diet which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... you have to commit yourself everyday to the idea of achieving whatever healthy look you desire. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nMusic: epidemicsound.com\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

                "description": "This Yin Yoga class is one of the best ways to not only increase flexibility in your legs and hips but it will also help you release any stored up negative energy in your body. Emotional energy, (if not dealt with or released) overtime will manifest as physical illness in your body. Whether that is as sickness, or simple muscles aches and tension. \nBy holding each posture in this yin yoga class bring your awareness to anything that you believe no longer serves you. As you exhale, visualize this negative energy leaving your body and breath in positive and peaceful energy. Releasing any stress or worry and filling your mind and body with positive high frequency vibrations. \n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nEach posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1-2 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. \n\nYin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:\n\n-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body\n-Stress and anxiety reduction\n-Increased circulation\n-Improved flexibility\n-Fascial release\n\nEnjoy and let go of all that no longer serves you,\n\nJuliana & Mark \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nConnect With Us!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\nMusic By: www.epidemicsound.com\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

                "description": "This 21 day Ab Challenge is a little different then some of the other challenges that we've done before. So read the description carefully, and get ready to sweat!\n\n\nThe Rules:\nThe only rule to this challenge is that everyday you're going to push yourself a little further then the day before. So grab a pen and paper so at the end of each day you can keep track of where you stopped to reference when you start the next day. \n\n\nThe Schedule: \nThe schedule for this challenge will be 2 days of core work and 1 day of yoga for 3 weeks. which will mean your core is becoming stronger and stronger with each day! \n\n\nThe Goal:\nThe goal here is to build the strength in your core, to trim the waistline, and to help you get that ab definition a lot of us strive to achieve. \n\n\nDAY ITINERARY:\n\nDay 1: \nDo this workout as far as your feel the strength of your body can take you, and then stop. If you stop three minutes in, thats completely ok. If you finish the entire class once through completely, start it up a second time and continue till you have to stop. Listen to your body, and make sure to stop when it tells you. \n\nDay 2: \nDo it again, but use the day before as a marker point and make sure you make it to at least to the same spot if not further. \n\nDay 3: \nTake a break and replace this workout with any of the following yoga classes below...\n\nRelaxing Yoga For Peace \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYiV4ztPVu0\n\nStress Relief Yoga \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHdwAsUtRBg\n\nYin Yoga Class \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsKUBO_TPRk\n\nPerfect Yoga For Everyone \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA6vjBPlmCE\n\nBest Yoga For The Heart \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b794DpXLJw\n\nYoga For Sleep \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txasA5fOtGI\n\nEasy Yoga For Beginners \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F0l9lVnKdQ\n\n\nDay 4: \nCome back to this class and make sure you go even further than the last time you did it (Day 2). \n\nDay 5 & Onward:\nContinue to cycle two days of this video and one day of yoga for 21 days. Always mark down where you made it to. And always make sure to match that spot or go further the next day when you come back to this class. \n\nREMEMBER- \nIf you make it to the end of the class, you are not done yet! You have to start the class up again and go until you have to stop. That's the name of the game. \n\nGood luck with the challenge! Let us know how it goes for you... let's get those abs nice and strong!! \n\n- Juliana and Mark \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nSpecial thank you to the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge and the wonderful Erin for allowing us to shoot on your beautiful property!\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

                    "description": "This 21 day Ab Challenge is a little different then some of the other challenges that we've done before. So read the description carefully, and get ready to sweat!\n\n\nThe Rules:\nThe only rule to this challenge is that everyday you're going to push yourself a little further then the day before. So grab a pen and paper so at the end of each day you can keep track of where you stopped to reference when you start the next day. \n\n\nThe Schedule: \nThe schedule for this challenge will be 2 days of core work and 1 day of yoga for 3 weeks. which will mean your core is becoming stronger and stronger with each day! \n\n\nThe Goal:\nThe goal here is to build the strength in your core, to trim the waistline, and to help you get that ab definition a lot of us strive to achieve. \n\n\nDAY ITINERARY:\n\nDay 1: \nDo this workout as far as your feel the strength of your body can take you, and then stop. If you stop three minutes in, thats completely ok. If you finish the entire class once through completely, start it up a second time and continue till you have to stop. Listen to your body, and make sure to stop when it tells you. \n\nDay 2: \nDo it again, but use the day before as a marker point and make sure you make it to at least to the same spot if not further. \n\nDay 3: \nTake a break and replace this workout with any of the following yoga classes below...\n\nRelaxing Yoga For Peace \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYiV4ztPVu0\n\nStress Relief Yoga \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHdwAsUtRBg\n\nYin Yoga Class \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsKUBO_TPRk\n\nPerfect Yoga For Everyone \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA6vjBPlmCE\n\nBest Yoga For The Heart \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b794DpXLJw\n\nYoga For Sleep \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txasA5fOtGI\n\nEasy Yoga For Beginners \u2665 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F0l9lVnKdQ\n\n\nDay 4: \nCome back to this class and make sure you go even further than the last time you did it (Day 2). \n\nDay 5 & Onward:\nContinue to cycle two days of this video and one day of yoga for 21 days. Always mark down where you made it to. And always make sure to match that spot or go further the next day when you come back to this class. \n\nREMEMBER- \nIf you make it to the end of the class, you are not done yet! You have to start the class up again and go until you have to stop. That's the name of the game. \n\nGood luck with the challenge! Let us know how it goes for you... let's get those abs nice and strong!! \n\n- Juliana and Mark \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nSpecial thank you to the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge and the wonderful Erin for allowing us to shoot on your beautiful property!\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nConnect With Us!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

We have sold all of our belongings, quit our jobs in Toronto, bought a used van, got our dog, a suitcase each, some filming gear and off we go.\n\nLife has blessed us with opportunities so that we can make a step forward in exploring this beautiful unpredictable adventure called life. And our hearts are filled with pure gratitude for how this amazing adventure has opened up for us.\n\nIs it scary to leave like that? I can\u2019t say it\u2019s not. Its scary changing your life. Stepping forward into the complete unknown, without a plan, a security line, or a plan B ready to be played. But at the same time I\u2019ve never felt so liberated in my life. And every time someone asks so where will you go next, it\u2019s thrilling to hear ourselves stutter on the words, \u201cwe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nNo more attachments, just our love, our dog, and this beautiful experience of existence.

                    "description": "Yes, it is true. We have sold all of our belongings, quit our jobs in Toronto, bought a used van, got our dog, a suitcase each, some filming gear and off we go.\n\nLife has blessed us with opportunities so that we can make a step forward in exploring this beautiful unpredictable adventure called life. And our hearts are filled with pure gratitude for how this amazing adventure has opened up for us.\n\nIs it scary to leave like that? I can\u2019t say it\u2019s not. Its scary changing your life. Stepping forward into the complete unknown, without a plan, a security line, or a plan B ready to be played. But at the same time I\u2019ve never felt so liberated in my life. And every time someone asks so where will you go next, it\u2019s thrilling to hear ourselves stutter on the words, \u201cwe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nNo more attachments, just our love, our dog, and this beautiful experience of existence. We\u2019re about to drive upon an empty road that will lead us to beautiful, adventurous, frighting, and awakening experiences.\n\nFollow our diaries...\n\nLove,\n\nMark and Juliana \n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad--------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\n\nBoho Beautiful is a travel yoga lifestyle channel that is creating positive content for your body, mind, and the earth.

                "description": "This Yin Yoga Flow class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. Focusing on fusing Vinyasa based flow (Yang) with slow and tension releasing postures (Yin), this class is great to do in morning as well as anytime during the day as we focus on first warming up the body with a flow, and then taking it into a deep release by holding each Yin pose for 2 minutes. \n\nRemember, breathing is a very important factor in any Yin Yoga class so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out.

Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make. \n\n\n\nWhat is Yin Yoga?\n\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nEach posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1-2 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. \n\nYin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:\n\n-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body\n-Stress and anxiety reduction\n-Increased circulation\n-Improved flexibility\n-Fascial release\n\nEnjoy and let go of all that no longer serves you,\n\nJuliana & Mark \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad----------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot in Playa Hermosa, Costa Rica\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... \n\n ----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad------------------------\n\nJuliana is wearing a sports bra from Mermaid Mafia: \nhttp://www.mermaidmafia.com.au\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... \n\n ----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad------------------------\n\nJuliana is wearing a sports bra from Mermaid Mafia: \nhttp://www.mermaidmafia.com.au\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

                "description": "After reading all your amazing comments and suggestions on our last gratitude blog, meditations seemed to be highly requested so we chose this one to edit next. Thank you guys so much!\n xo MJ\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBest Guided Meditation For Inner Strength \u2665 Day 7\n\nEvery single one of us goes through rough patches in our lives. May it be in our relationships, family, career, health or financial situations. Its hard sometimes not to let life's challenges get you down however whatever situation it may be...it is the universe testing you and giving you a chance to grow, become stronger, and learn a lesson from every situation. \n\nSo in this guided meditation we are going to be focusing on finding that inner strength within yourself to help you get through whatever problems you may be facing in your life today or if you simply need a  energetic boost to start your day in a strong and powerful way. \n\nWhatever the reason may be, use this meditation to find the strength within yourself to be the best and strongest version of yourself. Its within you, you just have to look a little deeper. \n\nXO\n\nRemember...\n\nWhen you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you \"do\" in life. But meditation is not a \"doing\", it is a \"being\". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. \n\nThe trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go.  Meditation to me, and what I would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness.  \n\nWhen you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always.

                    "description": "After reading all your amazing comments and suggestions on our last gratitude blog, meditations seemed to be highly requested so we chose this one to edit next. Thank you guys so much!\n xo MJ\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBest Guided Meditation For Inner Strength \u2665 Day 7\n\nEvery single one of us goes through rough patches in our lives. May it be in our relationships, family, career, health or financial situations. Its hard sometimes not to let life's challenges get you down however whatever situation it may be...it is the universe testing you and giving you a chance to grow, become stronger, and learn a lesson from every situation. \n\nSo in this guided meditation we are going to be focusing on finding that inner strength within yourself to help you get through whatever problems you may be facing in your life today or if you simply need a  energetic boost to start your day in a strong and powerful way. \n\nWhatever the reason may be, use this meditation to find the strength within yourself to be the best and strongest version of yourself. Its within you, you just have to look a little deeper. \n\nXO\n\nRemember...\n\nWhen you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you \"do\" in life. But meditation is not a \"doing\", it is a \"being\". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. \n\nThe trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go.  Meditation to me, and what I would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness.  \n\nWhen you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. \nMore than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate. It is just acceptance. And you. \n\nThere are so many great benefits to meditation once you truly learn to love the process and practice it daily. Through mediation you will slowly begin to achieve more patience in your every day life, how to appreciate the simple things, and how to find the space in your mind to spread more love and kindness into the world around you. \n\nFind a comfortable seated position, put some headphones on, relax, and allow yourself to let go and surrender into the now. \n\nNamaste.

                "description": "What is Yin Yoga?\nYin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice.\n\nSuitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.\n\nEach posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. \n\nYin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:\n\n-Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body\n-Stress and anxiety reduction\n-Increased circulation\n-Improved flexibility\n-Fascial release\n\nThis 20 min Yin Yoga class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your body has been craving for. Do this practice after a long day at work/school or after a vigorous workout. Remember, breathing is a very important factor in Yin Yoga so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make. \n\nRelax, go deep, enjoy xo\n\nJuliana\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nConnect With Us!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad----------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot in Koh Wai, Thailand. \n\nVideo Production- Mark Spicoluk\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

Weather you've had a stressful day, or an amazing day full of excitement this meditation will help you unwind, relax and prepare your mind for a deep restful sleep. \n\nThe setting of this meditation means a lot to myself and mark, it was shot at the Elephant Nature Park's Kachanaburi locatin- Elephant Haven- right on the bank of the river Kwai. Please check out their great cause:\nhttp://www.elephantnaturepark.org\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Elephant-Haven-Thailand-\n\nRemember...\n\nWhen you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you \"do\" in life. But meditation is not a \"doing\", it is a \"being\". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. \n\nThe trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go.  Meditation to me, and what I would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness.  \n\nWhen you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. \nMore than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate. It is just acceptance. And you. \n\nThere are so many great benefits to meditation once you truly learn to love the process and practice it daily. Through mediation you will slowly begin to achieve more patience in your every day life, how to appreciate the simple things, and how to find the space in your mind to spread more love and kindness into the world around you. \n\nFind a comfortable seated position, put some headphones on, relax, and allow yourself to let go and surrender into the now. \n\nNamaste.

Both exercise and practices are great and I would recommend if you have the time to do both (first workout then yoga). However, most of us don't have that amount of time therefore a great combination of yoga and strengthening exercises will be the best way to get those results you want.  \n\nIf you are looking to cure your morning fatigue, refocus your mind or wake up every muscle in your body to start your day, this is the perfect morning yoga class for you. \n\nPair this morning yoga workout class with some of my other fitness videos to create an hour long full body workout! \n\nThe following classes below would go great with this video:\n\nBest Pilates Booty Workout | Amazing Tone & Definition In 10 Minutes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lULmgJ2vUJI\n\nBrazilian Butt Lift Challenge\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-5WsFKlKDk\n\nBeach Booty Workout\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vts-iZHyPgA\n\nBest Bikini Full Body Burn\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IyYtxdDqJw\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot In Koh Wai, Thailand\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

                    "description": "A quick but extremely effective yoga workout class aimed to target stubborn areas in your midsection through a combination of strengthening plank exercises, a yoga flow to raise the heart rate, and lengthening yoga postures to increase blood flow and speed up your metabolism. The most perfect way to start your day! Get your body awake and ready to go. \n\nhttps://www.bohobeautiful.life\nMany people wonder if starting your day with a hard workout or a yoga practice is better? Both exercise and practices are great and I would recommend if you have the time to do both (first workout then yoga). However, most of us don't have that amount of time therefore a great combination of yoga and strengthening exercises will be the best way to get those results you want.  \n\nIf you are looking to cure your morning fatigue, refocus your mind or wake up every muscle in your body to start your day, this is the perfect morning yoga class for you. \n\nPair this morning yoga workout class with some of my other fitness videos to create an hour long full body workout! \n\nThe following classes below would go great with this video:\n\nBest Pilates Booty Workout | Amazing Tone & Definition In 10 Minutes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lULmgJ2vUJI\n\nBrazilian Butt Lift Challenge\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-5WsFKlKDk\n\nBeach Booty Workout\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vts-iZHyPgA\n\nBest Bikini Full Body Burn\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IyYtxdDqJw\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot In Koh Wai, Thailand\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

                "description": "This is a 10 minute guided meditation that is meant to help you start your day in a calm and loving way. This is day four of our full meditation series and in this video we will be focusing on self-acceptance. With the idea of finding acceptance in every situation that we encounter in our lives, for ourselves and our current place in life.  \n\nIn meditation, one of the methods that helps anchor oursleves is focusing your mind on a specific mantra. The mantra becomes a wonderful tool to pull you back when your mind wanders and to allow your mind to explore the depths and emotions surrounding that idea at the same time. In this video I will be providing you with a mantra or centering thought for you to carry through your meditation and into the rest of your day. \n\n\"I am doing enough. I have enough. I am enough\". \n\nWhen you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you \"do\" in life. But meditation is not a \"doing\", it is a \"being\". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. \n\nThe trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go. Meditation to me, and what i would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness. \n\nWhen you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time it will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. \nMore than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate. It is just acceptance. And you. \n\nIf you have ever wondered how to meditate? Or were curious about meditation challenges. Wanted to know how to breathe when mediating? How to clear your thoughts? How to bring more abundance and positivity into your life? This guided mediation will help. \n\nThere are so many great benefits to meditation once you truly learn to love the process and practice it daily. Through mediation you will slowly begin to achieve more patience in your every day life, how to appreciate the simple things, and how to find the space in your mind to spread more love and kindness into the world around you. \n\nFind a comfortable seated position, relax, and follow along on this peaceful and stress releasing mediation for beginners.\n\nNamaste.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot In Picton, ON Canada\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

We aren't meant to live in the boxes they have made for us. We arent meant to stare at digital screen and pixels all day long like the rest of them. There has to be so much more to all of this. On this rock, in this mystic wondrous universe, spinning around a burning ball of gas and laughing and smiling and wondering if anything amidst this beautiful madness will ever be figured out. When finding something you love to do is the first step to everything, finding someone you love to share it with... if even for a moment... is the singular star in your life's sky. \n\nWe stayed in our home country Canada this summer and explored the beautiful surroundings like this Sandbanks Provincial Park in Picton, Ontario. We packed our car, took our gear and camping supplies and set of to shoot some videos. \n\nTravel, create memories, and see what the world has to offer.

We aren't meant to live in the boxes they have made for us. We arent meant to stare at digital screen and pixels all day long like the rest of them. There has to be so much more to all of this. On this rock, in this mystic wondrous universe, spinning around a burning ball of gas and laughing and smiling and wondering if anything amidst this beautiful madness will ever be figured out. When finding something you love to do is the first step to everything, finding someone you love to share it with... if even for a moment... is the singular star in your life's sky. \n\nWe stayed in our home country Canada this summer and explored the beautiful surroundings like this Sandbanks Provincial Park in Picton, Ontario. We packed our car, took our gear and camping supplies and set of to shoot some videos. \n\nTravel, create memories, and see what the world has to offer. Life is too precious not to. \n\nWanderlust Forever xo\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot in beautiful Picton, Ontario Canada.\n\nVideo Production- Mark Spicoluk\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

One of my favourite salad recipes:  http://ohsheglows.com/2013/11/25/the-best-shredded-kale-salad/\n\n\u2665 Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night so your muscles have time to recover and rest. \n\n\u2665 And always remember one last thing, if you want the best results you have to apply 2 rules and stick to them: You have to work hard AND eat clean.  I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... you have to commit yourself everyday to the idea of achieving whatever healthy look you desire. \n\n\nSo enjoy the challenge, sweat tons, & don't hesitate to come to me with questions, for advice, and to please tell me your story & show me your results! \n\nxo\nJuliana \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot In Sandbanks Provincial Park, Picton ON\n\nSong: Another Perspective\nArtist: Silent Partner\n\nVideo Production- Mark Spicoluk\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

                    "description": "Whether you doing this as a single exercise or committing to the 14 day challenge this 15 min butt workout is targeted to tone, sculpt, and lift your glutes to shape your own perfect butt. \n\n\n---THE 2 WEEK CHALLENGE---\n\n\n\u2665 WEEK 1 \u2665 \nOne time through the video: 15 min\n\nMonday: One Set\nTuesday: One Set\nWednesday: Day Off\nThursday: One Set\nFriday: One Set\nSaturday: Day Off\n\n\n\u2665 WEEK 2 \u2665 \nTwo times through the video: 30 min\n* Note- Use the video intro as a water break/rest before 2nd set*\n\nSunday: Two Sets\nMonday: Day Off\nTuesday: Two Sets\nWednesday: Day Off\nThursday: Two Sets\nFriday: Day Off\nSaturday: Two Sets\nSunday: Two Sets \n\n\n\u2665 DAY OFFS \u2665 \nCycle through & try various combinations of the following videos on your Day Off to ensure your glutes & body are stretched and rested:\n\nSore Glutes Yoga\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSY-doiutzo\n\nPost-Workout Yoga \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lupXygvF8jY\n\nHip Opening Yoga\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSY-doiutzo\n\nLeg Flexibility Yoga \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWCyYhczU6M\n\nMorning Yoga Workout\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3-VGAND8Aw\n\n\n\u2665 CHALLENGE GUIDELINES \u2665\n  \n\u2665 Drink at least 2 L of water per day through the challenge.\n\n\u2665 Always include this particular stretch video at the end of the workout: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IeS84sb3ZQ\n\n\u2665 Include at least one dark green leafy salad per day. One of my favourite salad recipes:  http://ohsheglows.com/2013/11/25/the-best-shredded-kale-salad/\n\n\u2665 Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night so your muscles have time to recover and rest. \n\n\u2665 And always remember one last thing, if you want the best results you have to apply 2 rules and stick to them: You have to work hard AND eat clean.  I eat a plant based diet (yes im a vegan fitness girl) which helps a lot and I highly recommend it. But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... you have to commit yourself everyday to the idea of achieving whatever healthy look you desire. \n\n\nSo enjoy the challenge, sweat tons, & don't hesitate to come to me with questions, for advice, and to please tell me your story & show me your results! \n\nxo\nJuliana \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot In Sandbanks Provincial Park, Picton ON\n\nSong: Another Perspective\nArtist: Silent Partner\n\nVideo Production- Mark Spicoluk\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.

                "description": "This is an easy ten minute guided mediation for beginners. Please put some headphones on, find a comfortable place to sit, and then just listen to my voice. \nWhen you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you \"do\" in life. But meditation is not a \"doing\", it is a \"being\". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. \n\nThe trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go.  Meditation to me, and what i would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness.  \n\nWhen you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. \nMore than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate.

                    "description": "This is an easy ten minute guided mediation for beginners. Please put some headphones on, find a comfortable place to sit, and then just listen to my voice. \nWhen you start your meditation practice its easy to not know what to expect or even to expect something from it like you might get from anything else you \"do\" in life. But meditation is not a \"doing\", it is a \"being\". It is a learning to find stillness and peace within the idea that the moment you are in, the moment you are experiencing right at that moment is enough. \n\nThe trick is that our minds are not used to this way of thinking. Our modern day lives & culture tend to clutter our conscious thoughts with projections and stress towards the future and the past. Meditation helps us learn to let go.  Meditation to me, and what i would like to share with you, is about bathing in the now. And finding peace with exactly who you are, where you are, and that all other chatter in your head can and eventually will be cleansed by the regular practice and training of momentary awareness.  \n\nWhen you start your mind is not used to this. It will fight back and flare up with thoughts and wander and tell you its bored and you should stop. These are all normal experiences. Always. The trick is to breath it in when it happens, see it happening, and exhale it out only to reset your focus again. Its not a failure. Its just what happened. And in time will happen less and less as your focus and mind becomes more and more accustomed to quiet, peace, and stillness. \nMore than anything in life, there is no result when you meditate. It is just acceptance. And you. \n\nIf you have ever wondered how to meditate? Or wanted to know how to breathe when mediating? How to clear your thoughts? How to clear stress and anxiety from your day? This guided mediation will help. \n\nThere are so many great benefits to meditation once u truly learn to love the process and practice it daily. Through mediation you will slowly begin to achieve more patience in your every day life, how to appreciate the simple things, and how to find the space in your mind to spread more love and kindness into the world around you. \n\nFind a comfortable seated position, relax, and follow along on this peaceful and stress releasing mediation for beginners.\n\nNamaste. \n\nRelax, Release and Let Go. \n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot In Beautiful Tode Hall, Arenal Lake.

But the working hard piece comes from within each of us... you have to commit yourself everyday to the idea of achieving whatever healthy look you desire. \n\nEnjoy and comment below to tell me how you feel afterwards. :)\n\nxo\nJuliana \n\nSurf Villa Vistas is where we stay and where this was shot in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica!  \nhttp://www.surfvistavillas.com \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store - https://app.bohobeautiful.tv/IOS-1 \nAndroid Store - https://app.bohobeautiful.tv/android-1\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://flow.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://flow.bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://flow.bohobeautiful.life/store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad--------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot In Surf Vista Villas, Santa Teresa.

No matter how much resistance we meet. \nI believe we each have the strength in us to evolve. \nThat we are all beautiful. \nThat we can do anything. \nAnd that the power of one, is enough to change the course. \nI believe in you. \n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-----------------------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-------------\nBoho Beautiful Yoga Links:\nBoho Beautiful Official- Our NEW Streaming Platform & App https://www.bohobeautiful.tv\n\nDownload from your App Store Right Now! \nApple Store- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boho-beautiful-official/id1508335876 \nAndroid Store- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bohobeautiful.BohoBeautifulTV\n\nGet Two FREE Boho Beautiful Books here! https://www.bohobeautiful.life/returnhome\n\nBoho Beautiful Life- Our 2nd More Personal Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbs2c6JCjU_HZPOeY6jWVg/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBoho Beautiful RETREAT- Your 7 Day Home Yoga Retreat https://bohobeautiful.life/retreat\n\nBoho Instagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n\nThank you so much for watching and subscribing to our channel! \nLet's Connect!\n\nOur Custom App & Streaming Platform- https://www.bohobeauitful.tv\nPremium Programs- https://www.bohobeautiful.life/our-store\nBoho Beautiful Website- https://www.bohobeautiful.life\nInstagram- http://instagram.com/bohobeautifullife\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/bohobeautifullife\n\n------------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nShot In Beautiful Saint Lucia \n \n\nSong: Black Flag Blues\nArtist: KoalaT (Spicoluk)\n\nVideo Production- Mark & Juliana\n\n-----------------------------\u00ad---------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad------------\u00ad---\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease consult your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program.
