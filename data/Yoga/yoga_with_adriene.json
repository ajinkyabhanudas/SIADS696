This is a tradition I have incorporated since my very first 30 Day Yoga offering, and to me this journey would not be complete without this ending and this invitation. Don\u2019t panic. You have the vocabulary, you have the connection. You have it all. \n\nAllow one breath to lead you to the next. One present moment to the next. As your guide, as your friend, I will still be here with you. You may always use me as a guide. Trust your vocabulary, trust the integrity that you have been bringing into this practice.\n\nIf all you do is lie down on your mat and breathe for the duration of this practice, I think that is great. \n\nBut I think that you will find that you have the curiosity, the energy, the interest, and the trust in yourself to Find What Feels Good and to create and embody your practice.\n\nMay you open your heart and mind to having a deeper connection with your breath on and off the mat.\n\nMay your heart and mind be open to believing in yourself and the power we receive when we take a breath and begin again. \n\nI always get emotional on Day 30 because I think this is such a truly special and remarkable, meaningful exchange. Thank you for saying yes. \n\nI hope that this journey has served you and continues to serve you in the form of regular practice, holding you and celebrating you, for many more days to come. \n\nMay you be inspired well beyond today to keep returning to your practice, returning to your breath, returning to your self.\n\nI would love to hear from you today, drop me a note in the comment section below. \n\n\nContinue with your practice and keep the momentum you have built with BREATH!

You can also come into a chair, or on the edge of your couch when we take this shape. That is a great way to modify and possibly a better spot for you to tune in, work with the breath technique, and warm up before we get moving into other shapes each day. \n\nFinally, set an intention. Be brave and ask WHY? Why are you here? What do you think pulled you here? And if you don\u2019t know, that is okay, we will likely uncover that together.

                    "description": "It is happening! Today\u2019s video is a bit of an orientation, a warm welcome, and an official kick-off. We will begin with a few easy group breaths to enjoy, and recognize that if all you do is arrive here to breathe, you are winning, golden, exactly where you are meant to be. \n\nYou can consider this a practice day for your upcoming practices if you like. \n\n**IMPORTANT** If you are not signed up for the daily email that corresponds with each practice video, sign up for free and receive your free BREATH calendar here: https://www.yogawithadriene.com/breath\n\nWork with what you have, but in this video, I make some suggestions on some optional things you might like to bring to class each day, along with an invitation to help guide you as you embark on this unique journey. \n\nCheck-in with your willingness to be present, and remember for this to take off - you have to show up.\n\nIf this cross-legged position is not doable for you, you can use blankets, blocks, or pillows to sit up on. You can also come into a chair, or on the edge of your couch when we take this shape. That is a great way to modify and possibly a better spot for you to tune in, work with the breath technique, and warm up before we get moving into other shapes each day. \n\nFinally, set an intention. Be brave and ask WHY? Why are you here? What do you think pulled you here? And if you don\u2019t know, that is okay, we will likely uncover that together. (How exciting!)\n\nLet me know where you are practicing from in the comment section down below!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\u2764\ufe0f BREATH - Downloadable Collection \u2764\ufe0f\nhttps://bit.ly/breath-downloadable\nBased on requests from the community, we are excited to announce a downloadable version of BREATH.

                "description": "On the journey to seek connection, yoga offers us a chance to both look inward, and to expand outward all in one breath, one shape, shifting to the next breath, the next shape. It offers us the tools to stay present with ourselves and to be present with one another in the NOW. Now can be uncertain, uncomfortable, and at times, not fun. We long for time with friends, activities that feel supportive, we miss togetherness, and we fear for the future. \n\nTake time to fill your cup, practice feeling your own presence, and share sacred space with one another!  \n\nThis is a session that you can do with your buddies, on a special day, or to celebrate a party of one, as a gift you give yourself. \n\nAllow. Release. Enjoy this practice. \n\nLet me know how it goes and where you are practicing from in the comment section below!\n\nFor more videos like this, check out:\nYoga for a Rainy Day: https://youtu.be/1y-3pGVVQkE\nConfidence Boost Yoga: https://youtu.be/xEyyu7kk0ZI\nFeel Good Flow: https://youtu.be/1-AJwAjoWR0\nYoga to Get the Juices Flowing: https://youtu.be/JOilkvadChg\n\nSuggested Playlist: Love Yo\u2019Self: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzxnCWxVUD2JBFASKfVhBi7c\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\u2764\ufe0fSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! \u2764\ufe0f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\u2640\ufe0fBecome a FWFG YOGA member! \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udfff\u2640\ufe0f\nhttps://fwfg.com/?via=adriene\nJoin Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.

It offers us the tools to stay present with ourselves and to be present with one another in the NOW. Now can be uncertain, uncomfortable, and at times, not fun. We long for time with friends, activities that feel supportive, we miss togetherness, and we fear for the future. \n\nTake time to fill your cup, practice feeling your own presence, and share sacred space with one another!  \n\nThis is a session that you can do with your buddies, on a special day, or to celebrate a party of one, as a gift you give yourself. \n\nAllow. Release.

Today, I invite you to find freedom within the form. Don\u2019t decide where it ends. Embody it. Listen. Pay attention. Respond. Intuit. \n\nThis is a powerful practice that starts with a good dose of spinal flexion and ends with creative core. Look, we have come a long way so I intuited that a little Wu-Tang boat pose was most necessary, for me. Don\u2019t forget\u2026 it\u2019s okay to have FUN!\n\nUse your breath to bring yourself back home, darling. We continue to play with our vocabulary today before our final session, Day 30.\n\nWe are almost there, though I must gently warn you\u2026 tomorrow\u2019s practice will be different. But the same. (Cool, Adriene.)\n\nIt is all a part of the journey, which is most certainly the reward.\n\nThe process is the candy. \nSee?\n\nHonor the time you\u2019ve taken to listen and hone your intuition. Seek to move in a way that feels truly in alignment with who you are.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s try to get in the habit of taking only what we need and not more than what we need.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nLet me know how it goes for you in the comment section down below! \n\n#ywahome   #30DaysofYoga   #freeyoga   \n  \n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\u2764\ufe0fSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! \u2764\ufe0f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\u2640\ufe0fBecome a FWFG YOGA member! \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udfff\u2640\ufe0f\nhttps://fwfg.com/?via=adriene\nJoin Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.

Look, we have come a long way so I intuited that a little Wu-Tang boat pose was most necessary, for me. Don\u2019t forget\u2026 it\u2019s okay to have FUN!\n\nUse your breath to bring yourself back home, darling. We continue to play with our vocabulary today before our final session, Day 30.\n\nWe are almost there, though I must gently warn you\u2026 tomorrow\u2019s practice will be different. But the same. (Cool, Adriene.)\n\nIt is all a part of the journey, which is most certainly the reward.\n\nThe process is the candy. \nSee?\n\nHonor the time you\u2019ve taken to listen and hone your intuition. Seek to move in a way that feels truly in alignment with who you are.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s try to get in the habit of taking only what we need and not more than what we need.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nLet me know how it goes for you in the comment section down below! \n\n#ywahome   #30DaysofYoga   #freeyoga   \n  \n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\u2764\ufe0fSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! \u2764\ufe0f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\u2640\ufe0fBecome a FWFG YOGA member! \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udfff\u2640\ufe0f\nhttps://fwfg.com/?via=adriene\nJoin Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.

Today\u2019s 20-minute session should fly by but will require you to dial inwards. For how else will you balance on one leg, my dear?\n\nThe invitation today is one in which you can focus or re-focus back on your WHY. What led you to go on this journey in the first place? Remember, the goal is not to aspire to transform into something you have not yet become, but rather to return home to embody everything that you already are, fully. \n\nIn this session, we will focus on neck and shoulder relief, spinal flexion, and use what we\u2019ve learned so far to maintain balance between the left and right sides of the body. Use the flow to build heat and enjoy the process of learning to find your balance. \n\nPro-tip: work with your breath and lead from your center. \nWhere attention goes, energy flows. \n\nVisit behind the scenes of YWA!

Today\u2019s 20-minute session should fly by but will require you to dial inwards. For how else will you balance on one leg, my dear?\n\nThe invitation today is one in which you can focus or re-focus back on your WHY. What led you to go on this journey in the first place? Remember, the goal is not to aspire to transform into something you have not yet become, but rather to return home to embody everything that you already are, fully. \n\nIn this session, we will focus on neck and shoulder relief, spinal flexion, and use what we\u2019ve learned so far to maintain balance between the left and right sides of the body. Use the flow to build heat and enjoy the process of learning to find your balance. \n\nPro-tip: work with your breath and lead from your center. \nWhere attention goes, energy flows. \n\nVisit behind the scenes of YWA!

You will also get a little internal organ massage, boosting the health of the organs and the immune system. Who else will be able to say that they received that today?\n\nWe work with a pranayama called Breath Of Fire today. Fair warning, animals/pets love this one. \nIf you are interested in learning the foundations of this breath, check out this video here: https://youtu.be/jbtLH-3DfLc \n\nBe willing to receive the benefits of this incredible practice via your breath. \n\nI will guide you, but you have to bring the breath.

We will begin with some workshopping on the floor, continuing to explore and establish a core connection. Core connection that is sustainable and truly serves.  You will also get a little internal organ massage, boosting the health of the organs and the immune system. Who else will be able to say that they received that today?\n\nWe work with a pranayama called Breath Of Fire today. Fair warning, animals/pets love this one. \nIf you are interested in learning the foundations of this breath, check out this video here: https://youtu.be/jbtLH-3DfLc \n\nBe willing to receive the benefits of this incredible practice via your breath. \n\nI will guide you, but you have to bring the breath. I know you will.\n\nVisit behind the scenes of YWA!

I like to think that this notion of coming home really does make sense, because we are not trying to achieve balance, but rather return to it. The path to balance isn\u2019t always in the \u201cdoing.\u201d It can be about the undoing. Both require listening. \n\nIn addition to your daily alignment work, this flow lights up the energy we\u2019ve been cultivating this entire journey. It includes two sets of plank push-ups and some balancing work. But don\u2019t let that intimidate you. Instead, acknowledge what it took you to get here. \n\nLook how far we have come. You should feel proud.  \n\nThere is an option to follow this practice with an extra pranayama video if you have time.

                    "description": "Balance is our natural state. I like to think that this notion of coming home really does make sense, because we are not trying to achieve balance, but rather return to it. The path to balance isn\u2019t always in the \u201cdoing.\u201d It can be about the undoing. Both require listening. \n\nIn addition to your daily alignment work, this flow lights up the energy we\u2019ve been cultivating this entire journey. It includes two sets of plank push-ups and some balancing work. But don\u2019t let that intimidate you. Instead, acknowledge what it took you to get here. \n\nLook how far we have come. You should feel proud.  \n\nThere is an option to follow this practice with an extra pranayama video if you have time.

In this session, we work to re-pattern the rigid beginnings of our past and find our renewed sense of self. \n\nThis slower-paced, gentle practice invites you to focus on grounding through the feet, working with the currents of energy through the back and front body, and the marriage between the movement and the breath. \n\nIf you are feeling a little tired today, heads up, I got you. In fact, you will stay on the ground in a comfortable seat pose stretching it out for about the first 10 minutes. \n\nLook. It\u2019s all about connection. \n\nTake the time to seek it, play with it, unlock it, use it to bring yourself back to savor the moment, over and over again.\n\nStay open to the small (or large) ways in which these practices can show up off the mat. \n\n#ywahome   #30DaysofYoga   #freeyoga   \n  \n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\u2764\ufe0fSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! \u2764\ufe0f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\u2640\ufe0fBecome a FWFG YOGA member! \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udfff\u2640\ufe0f\nhttps://fwfg.com/?via=adriene\nJoin Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.

If you like, please take a couple mindful breaths to tune in before you press play. In today\u2019s practice, try to give your thinking mind a break, dropping expectations and patterns of judgment. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but use your tools. Namely, the sound of your breath. \n\nFeel it out. Loving reminder: You have everything you need here. \n\nSo move mindfully and take your time. If you are not in rhythm with my guidance, that is okay. \n\nMove at your own pace. Work where you are today. (There are so many layers to play with!)\n\nDarling, allow yourself to\u2026 dig in. \n\n\n#ywahome   #30DaysofYoga   #freeyoga   \n  \n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\u2764\ufe0fSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! \u2764\ufe0f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\u2640\ufe0fBecome a FWFG YOGA member! \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udfff\u2640\ufe0f\nhttps://fwfg.com/?via=adriene\nJoin Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.

Consider the idea that our practice is not one of \u201cdoing,\u201d or one of imminent mastery, but rather one of self-study. This is key for the journey HOME. \n\nWhat feels good? What doesn\u2019t? What feels honest?\nCan we begin to close the gap between how we feel and how we want to feel?\nThis time is about examining your self. It\u2019s not about doing it right. \n\nWhen we approach the practice through the lens of self-study, we find that we have everything we need to both gracefully and fiercely move toward what serves\u2026 and to move away from what doesn\u2019t.\n\nHonor your inner voice.

Consider the idea that our practice is not one of \u201cdoing,\u201d or one of imminent mastery, but rather one of self-study. This is key for the journey HOME. \n\nWhat feels good? What doesn\u2019t? What feels honest?\nCan we begin to close the gap between how we feel and how we want to feel?\nThis time is about examining your self. It\u2019s not about doing it right. \n\nWhen we approach the practice through the lens of self-study, we find that we have everything we need to both gracefully and fiercely move toward what serves\u2026 and to move away from what doesn\u2019t.\n\nHonor your inner voice.

(You have to wait till Day 8 for a total RELAX.)\n\nYou are working, but not any harder than you need to. See if you can let your breath do some of the heavy lifting today. Experiment.\n\nLearn to soften around hard edges. Practice softening in hard times. \n\nCan a rise of a breath guide you into a pose?\n\nWith regular practice, I start to experience a feeling in which I am living in a body that is working for me, rather than against.

In this session, we bring focus to the 5th Chakra or the Throat Chakra, an area the body that asks us to find our voice and snuggle up closer to our truth.\n\nPractice this session anytime or anywhere to stretch, breathe, re-center, and connect back to what matters most.\n\nBring attention to your neck, shoulders, heart.

In this Foundations Of Yoga video, Adriene guides a practice of Shoulder Stand for beginners. Though not for everybody, Shoulder Stand is known as the mother of all asanas! There are benefits to learning the prep work for this pose allowing you to work at your own pace, safely, and with controlled breathing. Inversions can seem intimidating, but done correctly, at your own pace, and with neck integration and awareness, it\u2019s possible to enjoy the revitalizing benefits they have to offer at any stage. Benefits of this practice include, increase in immunity, healthy blood flow, healthy digestion, as well as an opportunity to soothe the nervous system and any irritation, with regular practice.\n\nFor this video, you will need two blankets or towels.

Suited perfectly for the actual gardener, but also designed for the metaphorical gardener within each of us. \n\nIn this session, we will bring a loving release to the low back, hips, side torso, legs, ankles and feet. We will also stretch through the hands, wrists, and arms while practicing pranayama, or mindful breathing.

By committing to your breath in yoga practice you are committing to your total wellbeing. The result is a clear mind and a calm nervous system. This is also a swift practice so, in addition, we continue to gain strength, trim, tone and condition. All guided by the rhythm of your breath, your heart.\n\nThe last few days have prepared you for today's practice which uses Sun Salutations to inspire synchronicity. Stick with it!

Hilah knows her stuff and is all about making cooking fun, providing us with the tools to do awesome things in the kitchen in a way that feels good. (Like, she won't shame you if you do not know how to make an omelet.) She is one of my favorite people and she teaches me a lot. I hope you enjoy this video and learn how to make your own salad dressing. It has already inspired me to make many more salads with my meals since we shot this. If you have been makin' your dressing at home already- show off your stuff down below and tell us your favorite recipes! May this be inspiration for healthy eating or a compliment to your pizza.

Join me as I learn how to make two simple salad dressings in the actual Hilah Cooking Kitchen!!! \n\nHilah is a good (and by good I mean great) friend of mine but I still get so giddy and grateful when she invites me over and into her kitchen for a collaboration. Hilah knows her stuff and is all about making cooking fun, providing us with the tools to do awesome things in the kitchen in a way that feels good. (Like, she won't shame you if you do not know how to make an omelet.) She is one of my favorite people and she teaches me a lot. I hope you enjoy this video and learn how to make your own salad dressing. It has already inspired me to make many more salads with my meals since we shot this. If you have been makin' your dressing at home already- show off your stuff down below and tell us your favorite recipes! May this be inspiration for healthy eating or a compliment to your pizza.

A loving motivation.It is a direct response to the community, not a commercial yoga product. It is a project of mindfulness and a labor of love. It could be seen as 7 simple videos of yoga asana or postures. But baby, it can be so much more. RISE is an invitation to wellbeing and a warm welcoming back to you.You are not expected to have wide open spaces and lazy free time mornings for your yoga practice. We don't anticipate that there will be zero distractions. However, you do have to show up. Show up for yourself. Is there anything more beautiful?

Also just a challenging work out for those who don't like the gym or anyone needing that extra push to move it and groove it. HEART aims to get the heart rate up and invites you to sweat and get the blood pumping. A practice that invites you to open your mind and heart to new things. This \"Power Yoga\" sequence provides a full-body experience to connect you to your spirit, burn calories, and work it out. Connect you to your breath and get the blood pumping! This is my version of \"Cardio Yoga\" without all the frantic fitness frenzy!\n\nThough this practice is swift, I encourage you to move at your own pace and listen to your body. Allow the vinyasa to move with ease and take your time growing this practice. This vinyasa fusion focuses on toning and building strength in the lower back body. Connect your feet to the earth as you build strength in the legs, the glutes, and connect to your core to support lower back health.  \n\nI invite you to arrive on the mat for this practice with an open mind and HEART.\n\nHere are some Foundational Videos that might assist you as you practice HEART 1:\n\nDownward Dog  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j97SSGsnCAQ\nForward Fold - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7Uhp5tphAs\nSun Salutation A - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA4OLCHgLAI\nChair - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySafTekJ3Ls\nPigeon - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_zPqA65Nok\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\u2764\ufe0fSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! \u2764\ufe0f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\u2640\ufe0fBecome a FWFG YOGA member! \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udfff\u2640\ufe0f\nhttps://fwfg.com/?via=adriene\nJoin Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.

Also just a challenging work out for those who don't like the gym or anyone needing that extra push to move it and groove it. HEART aims to get the heart rate up and invites you to sweat and get the blood pumping. A practice that invites you to open your mind and heart to new things. This \"Power Yoga\" sequence provides a full-body experience to connect you to your spirit, burn calories, and work it out. Connect you to your breath and get the blood pumping! This is my version of \"Cardio Yoga\" without all the frantic fitness frenzy!\n\nThough this practice is swift, I encourage you to move at your own pace and listen to your body. Allow the vinyasa to move with ease and take your time growing this practice. This vinyasa fusion focuses on toning and building strength in the lower back body. Connect your feet to the earth as you build strength in the legs, the glutes, and connect to your core to support lower back health.  \n\nI invite you to arrive on the mat for this practice with an open mind and HEART.\n\nHere are some Foundational Videos that might assist you as you practice HEART 1:\n\nDownward Dog  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j97SSGsnCAQ\nForward Fold - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7Uhp5tphAs\nSun Salutation A - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA4OLCHgLAI\nChair - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySafTekJ3Ls\nPigeon - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_zPqA65Nok\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\u2764\ufe0fSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! \u2764\ufe0f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\u2640\ufe0fBecome a FWFG YOGA member! \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udfff\u2640\ufe0f\nhttps://fwfg.com/?via=adriene\nJoin Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.

This is a shorter practice to tone the abdominals in a mindful way that feels fun and supportive! Also, almost everyone wants more core strength and tone abdominals. You asked for it!\nUse this Day 6 practice to check in with the core. Mindful core training will support your entire practice and whole-body health. While tone abs are something we all fancy (me too) core strength training is so much more than washboard abs or a flat tummy. By building core strength you are supporting the back and all of the muscles that surround your dear spinal cord. By working those muscles we are taking some of our weight off the spine and engaging the entire body. We are more likely to do active, engaging things when the body is strong & engaged.

                "description": "Join Adriene on Day 3 of The 30 Days of Yoga journey! Forget What You Know About Yoga! It is so easy to slip into automatic pilot. For today's sequence, come into a beginner's mind. (Bonus if you are a beginner and totally new to yoga!) When we come to this idea of beginner's mind - we open up to all possibilities.\n\nUse this Day 3 practice to check in with balance and connect to your core center. Let go of expectations and stay receptive as you work to build strength and unlock more space. Again, open up to making new discoveries! If you are regular yogi this practice will be a great opportunity to change it up. If you are new to the practice, ROCK ON, you have that beautiful beginner's mind already. Seek opportunities to learn - especially in the difficulties. Everyone, close your eyes when you can, move mindfully, and trust yourself. Breathe. Breathe slowly. This revitalizing and strengthening sequence is great for balance, core & hip check-in, and supports good posture!

For today's sequence, come into a beginner's mind. (Bonus if you are a beginner and totally new to yoga!) When we come to this idea of beginner's mind - we open up to all possibilities.\n\nUse this Day 3 practice to check in with balance and connect to your core center. Let go of expectations and stay receptive as you work to build strength and unlock more space. Again, open up to making new discoveries! If you are regular yogi this practice will be a great opportunity to change it up. If you are new to the practice, ROCK ON, you have that beautiful beginner's mind already. Seek opportunities to learn - especially in the difficulties. Everyone, close your eyes when you can, move mindfully, and trust yourself. Breathe. Breathe slowly. This revitalizing and strengthening sequence is great for balance, core & hip check-in, and supports good posture!

Watch this video before you begin! \n\nIt includes helpful ideas and tips to support you on your journey! Today we begin with this video! Tomorrow - DAY 1 of YOGA. \n\n As we transition into the New Year I already feel great about the idea of practicing for 30 days straight. I feel excited about challenging myself, connecting to myself, and learning something new. I am grateful that my body is able to move, that my breath is capable of deepening and I love that I will be doing it with so many others, around the globe.\n \nThe hardest part each day will likely be getting on the mat.
