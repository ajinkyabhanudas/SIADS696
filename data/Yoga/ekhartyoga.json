In the human body, it refers to the balance of tension and compression to create strength and stability. The idea is that when tension and compression are in balance, our energy can be used optimally and efficiently and, in turn, this supports our mental and physical resilience.\n\nIn this fascinating webinar, Christine explains how we can apply and embody the concepts of tensegrity to our practice, through mindful movement and breath awareness. She\u2019ll also share why myofascial yoga isn\u2019t a style but an approach - one which brings together anatomy, philosophy, breath, lifestyle, and technique and can have a truly profound effect on the relationship we have with our body and how we move through the world.\n\nThis webinar was streamed LIVE on 8 February 2022.

                    "description": "Check out Christine's courses on the EkhartYoga Academy: https://www.ekhart-academy.com/fascia-nervous-system\nhttps://www.ekhart-academy.com/chronic-pain\nMyofascial Yoga for Stress Reduction program: https://www.ekhartyoga.com/programs/141/myofascial-yoga-for-stress-reduction\n\nTensegrity is a term combining the words \u2018tension\u2019 and \u2018integrity\u2019, originally used to describe a structure held in place by tensile and compressive forces. In the human body, it refers to the balance of tension and compression to create strength and stability. The idea is that when tension and compression are in balance, our energy can be used optimally and efficiently and, in turn, this supports our mental and physical resilience.\n\nIn this fascinating webinar, Christine explains how we can apply and embody the concepts of tensegrity to our practice, through mindful movement and breath awareness. She\u2019ll also share why myofascial yoga isn\u2019t a style but an approach - one which brings together anatomy, philosophy, breath, lifestyle, and technique and can have a truly profound effect on the relationship we have with our body and how we move through the world.\n\nThis webinar was streamed LIVE on 8 February 2022.

He\u2019ll begin with an overview of the bones and muscles in the hips. He\u2019ll then guide a short yoga practice to isolate and experience the movements of these bones and muscles. Then, we will \u2018expand our horizons\u2019 by incorporating different movements and non-yoga poses to gain a more integrated experience of the hips that reflects and supports their use in daily life. After the practice, there\u2019ll be a 30 minute Q&A session.\n\nYou will need some floor space and a yoga mat for the practice.\n\nStreamed LIVE on 11 May 2021.

He\u2019ll begin with an overview of the bones and muscles in the hips. He\u2019ll then guide a short yoga practice to isolate and experience the movements of these bones and muscles. Then, we will \u2018expand our horizons\u2019 by incorporating different movements and non-yoga poses to gain a more integrated experience of the hips that reflects and supports their use in daily life. After the practice, there\u2019ll be a 30 minute Q&A session.\n\nYou will need some floor space and a yoga mat for the practice.\n\nStreamed LIVE on 11 May 2021.

And after such a challenging year, who can blame us?! Planning, setting goals and resolutions can give us a sense of purpose and hope.\n\nAlthough this may be beneficial to a degree, the underlying message that we\u2019re also giving ourselves is that we\u2019re not quite happy/perfect now but we will be in the future when \u2018something\u2019 is different.\n\nThis year we\u2019d like to invite you to do things a little differently. Instead of entering the New Year with the wish to change ourselves or our current circumstances, we\u2019d like to teach you how to be deeply present with your reality. Because learning to be with \u2018what is\u2019 is an act that can bring about genuine peace.\n\nYou can still join the program here: https://www.ekhartyoga.com/programs/124/powerfully-present\nThe first class is free, and new members can enjoy a two week free trial.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \nBecome an EkhartYoga member! \nhttps://ekhartyoga.com/ - 14 day free trial\nExplore yoga and meditation classes from Esther Ekhart and other expert yoga teachers.

What\u2019s our target area?\nWhat are we trying to do with the pose? Is it to strengthen that target area or to stretch or open it? \n\nWhen we start with these two questions we are thinking of yoga in a more functional way and can then see if we need to adapt the yoga pose so that we are meeting these aims. For example, if we include chair pose / utkatasana in a class to strengthen the quads, would we do this more efficiently if we brought the feet wider into more of a squat position? \n\nLearn how to put this in practice with Esther Ekhart, Anat Geiger and Marcel van de Vis Heil in our Functional Yoga Program on EkhartYoga.com - starts February 17th.\n3 teachers bringing you our own perspective on Functional Yoga. \nYou can take out a two-week trial and try us for free.\n\n#functionalyoga #yoga #yogateacher\n\nPlease subscribe to this channel for regular free yoga videos\nhttp://www.youtube.com/EkhartYoga\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0fBecome an EkhartYoga member! \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nhttps://ekhartyoga.com/\nStart your 14 day free trial and explore our yoga and meditation classes from Esther Ekhart and other highly experienced yoga teachers.

                    "description": "https://www.ekhartyoga.com/programs/114/functional-yoga-program  \nMarcel van de Vis Heil talks us through some questions to ask when you\u2019re practicing yoga or sequencing yoga classes as a teacher. \nWhat area of the body are we working on? What\u2019s our target area?\nWhat are we trying to do with the pose? Is it to strengthen that target area or to stretch or open it? \n\nWhen we start with these two questions we are thinking of yoga in a more functional way and can then see if we need to adapt the yoga pose so that we are meeting these aims. For example, if we include chair pose / utkatasana in a class to strengthen the quads, would we do this more efficiently if we brought the feet wider into more of a squat position? \n\nLearn how to put this in practice with Esther Ekhart, Anat Geiger and Marcel van de Vis Heil in our Functional Yoga Program on EkhartYoga.com - starts February 17th.\n3 teachers bringing you our own perspective on Functional Yoga. \nYou can take out a two-week trial and try us for free.\n\n#functionalyoga #yoga #yogateacher\n\nPlease subscribe to this channel for regular free yoga videos\nhttp://www.youtube.com/EkhartYoga\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0fBecome an EkhartYoga member! \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nhttps://ekhartyoga.com/\nStart your 14 day free trial and explore our yoga and meditation classes from Esther Ekhart and other highly experienced yoga teachers.

In this flow we will move on with standing poses, how to do them still creating some heat in the body, without having to take a vinyasa in between. Of course you can keep going with the different standing poses this way, than moving on to some seated asana's and lying poses to finish it off.. The seated hip openers can be a nice follow up to this!  http://youtu.be/hsPUAppdfqs\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel here: http://bit.ly/uFapcc\nGo to my channels:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/yogatic\nhttp://www.youtube.com/EkhartYoga\n\nFollow me on Facebook :\nhttp://www.facebook.com/EkhartYoga\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/EkhartYoga\n\nFollow me on Pinterest:\nhttp://pinterest.com/ekhartyoga/\n\nLook me up on Google+ \u00a0:\nhttp://www.gplus.to/EkhartYoga",

                    "description": "http://www.EkhartYoga.com 2nd part of \"yoga flow avoiding down dog and chaturanga\". In this flow we will move on with standing poses, how to do them still creating some heat in the body, without having to take a vinyasa in between. Of course you can keep going with the different standing poses this way, than moving on to some seated asana's and lying poses to finish it off.. The seated hip openers can be a nice follow up to this!  http://youtu.be/hsPUAppdfqs\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel here: http://bit.ly/uFapcc\nGo to my channels:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/yogatic\nhttp://www.youtube.com/EkhartYoga\n\nFollow me on Facebook :\nhttp://www.facebook.com/EkhartYoga\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/EkhartYoga\n\nFollow me on Pinterest:\nhttp://pinterest.com/ekhartyoga/\n\nLook me up on Google+ \u00a0:\nhttp://www.gplus.to/EkhartYoga"
