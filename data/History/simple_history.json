From this location, the troops resisted the initial German assault and took to improving  their defensive position. On September 25th, the commander of the 42nd Guards Rifle Regiment ordered the men of his 3rd Rifle Battalion to capture two buildings that seemed like a good position for setting up a defense against German attacks. Junior Sergeant Yakov Fedotovich Pavlov of the 13th Guards Rifle Division was tasked with seizing  one of the buildings at the edge of the 9th January Square. On September 27th, followed by three soldiers from his squad, Pavlov entered the building under the cover of night and drove the defending Germans out of it. Once in their hands, the commander of the 42nd regiment designated it \u201cPavlov\u2019s House\u201d. \n\n\n\nBecome a Simple History member: https://www.youtube.com/simplehistory/join\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/simplehistory\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \nScript:  Dejan Milivojevic\nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/\n\nSources: \nAntill, Peter D., and Peter Dennis.

From this location, the troops resisted the initial German assault and took to improving  their defensive position. On September 25th, the commander of the 42nd Guards Rifle Regiment ordered the men of his 3rd Rifle Battalion to capture two buildings that seemed like a good position for setting up a defense against German attacks. Junior Sergeant Yakov Fedotovich Pavlov of the 13th Guards Rifle Division was tasked with seizing  one of the buildings at the edge of the 9th January Square. On September 27th, followed by three soldiers from his squad, Pavlov entered the building under the cover of night and drove the defending Germans out of it.

If you looked up Andriveau-Goujon\u2019s \u2018Carte g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Afrique\u2019 (1856) as an example, you will see a different Africa one with vast empty spaces. To be sure, it was a marked improvement to sixteenth century maps who used cyclops and giant elephants to hide their lack of knowledge, but yet you can still find fictional gigantic lakes and mountain ranges such as Lake Tanganyika and the Mountains of the Moon. Then, imagine you are tasked to find a single person in one of these entirely blank regions, while you also need to convince over a hundred strangers with you that this endeavor will be an undoubtedly dazzling success.

If you looked up Andriveau-Goujon\u2019s \u2018Carte g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Afrique\u2019 (1856) as an example, you will see a different Africa one with vast empty spaces. To be sure, it was a marked improvement to sixteenth century maps who used cyclops and giant elephants to hide their lack of knowledge, but yet you can still find fictional gigantic lakes and mountain ranges such as Lake Tanganyika and the Mountains of the Moon. Then, imagine you are tasked to find a single person in one of these entirely blank regions, while you also need to convince over a hundred strangers with you that this endeavor will be an undoubtedly dazzling success. Learn how Stanley even reached such an opportunity, having been born in Wales and disowned by his parents, to soon globetrotting and travel writing with his pockets continuously filled by the wealthiest of patrons.\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \n \nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/\n\nBibliography\n\nBaumeister, Roy F. and John Tierney. \u201cHenry Morton Stanley\u2019s Unbreakable Will.\u201d Accessed July 12, 2022.

In addition to this, the MRE has been designed to fulfil all operational requirements. This means that they remain shelf stable for a minimum of three years, or nine months in warmer climates. They also are highly durable and have the ability to survive  non-parachute drops of 100 feet and parachute drops of 1250 feet. With all these elements considered, a soldier can eat a full, nutritional meal wherever they find themselves.\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \n \nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/"

He named it the \u201cCongo Free State,\u201d which is rather ironic when you realise what went on there. \nThe local population was  anything but free.\n(1885-1908)\n\nBecome a Simple History member: https://www.youtube.com/simplehistory/join\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/simplehistory\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \n \nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/\n\n\n Arid Foothills - The Dark Contenent by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100437\n\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nSources \n\nGondola, Ch.

In essence, rearguard units are standard military units, most often infantry, but with a specific task. \nRearguard units were formed when a military formation was forced to evacuate its troops or to withdraw from the battlefield, very often under strong pressure made by enemy forces. In these cases the withdrawing main body of the formation would not be capable of fighting back. Quite opposite, it was very vulnerable to enemy attacks and in great danger of being destroyed. \n\n\nBecome a Simple History member: https://www.youtube.com/simplehistory/join\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/simplehistory\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \nScript: Dejan Milivojevic\nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/\n\nSources:\nDildy, Douglas C., and Howard Gerrard.

In battle, it\u2019s simply who they are, and where they are, whether they\u2019re stone-cold sober,  fueled by adrenaline, or even high on marijuana. That was precisely the case with Sergeant Peter Lemon of the U.S. Army. On April 1st, 1970, he helped defend his base against the  attacking North Vietnamese soldiers even though he was under the influence of marijuana. Lemon fought them with a machine gun, an assault rifle, hand grenades, and with his bare hands.

In battle, it\u2019s simply who they are, and where they are, whether they\u2019re stone-cold sober,  fueled by adrenaline, or even high on marijuana. That was precisely the case with Sergeant Peter Lemon of the U.S. Army. On April 1st, 1970, he helped defend his base against the  attacking North Vietnamese soldiers even though he was under the influence of marijuana. Lemon fought them with a machine gun, an assault rifle, hand grenades, and with his bare hands.
