Had to do some extensive rewrites. However I still stand by my opinion that this one of the most historically inaccurate films I've ever reviewed. I mean..Bill and Ted may be more stupid but at least it doesn't take itself seriously.

A team of present-day archaeologists are sent back in time to rescue their professor from medieval France in the middle of a battle. It stars Paul Walker, Frances O'Connor, Gerard Butler, Billy Connolly, David Thewlis and Anna Friel among others.\nJerry Goldsmith composed the original score, which would have been his last before his death in 2004, but it was replaced with a new score by Brian Tyler, after the first cut was re-edited and Goldsmith's increasing health problems did not allow him to continue. The film was poorly received by critics and was a box office failure.",

Had to do some extensive rewrites. However I still stand by my opinion that this one of the most historically inaccurate films I've ever reviewed. I mean..Bill and Ted may be more stupid but at least it doesn't take itself seriously. This one is trying to and that's what makes it more appalling.\n\n\u25cf Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/HistoryBuffsLondon\n\n\u25cf Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/HistoryBuffs_\n\n________________________________________\u00ad\u00ad_________________________________\n\n- Check out These Videos - \n\nZulu Review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VygWpmwBO8M \nGladiator Review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVAxzf1HdH4\nWe Were Soldiers - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ABJVrRfr2Q\nKingdom of Heaven \u2013 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTjUu1Bt29o\nThe Last Samurai \u2013 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-buQSp6wOMc\nWhy Game of Thrones reads like a History Book and not a Fantasy Epic - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knGeCNaAdAU\nThe Patriot - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBuvmidN8Dc\nThe Ghost and the Darkness - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o5QWPKL74E\n300 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXZt-IlClhs\n1492 Conquest of Paradise - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQWSwUbnofw\nAmadeus - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_iAGFaE80\nBraveheart - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojBwASARAzo\nVikings Historical Accuracy and Season 4 Predictions - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBehjjt6V70\nWaterloo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWKk5Sy0JT8\nAlexander - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzHQuAz0N60\nLawrence of Arabia - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9scZDbKxtY\nGoodfellas - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4mBGIDEeU\nAgora - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwUwjkEveBE\nSaving Private Ryan - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1aGH6NbbyE\nMaster and Commander - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Iwea41ua0Y\nApocalypto - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5pBZKj1VnA\nApollo 13 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjCOMJDULaE\nDances with Wolves - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d732rPkjqOU\nBand of Brothers - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxv3s7xTYHU\n\nTimeline is a 2003 science fiction adventure film directed by Richard Donner, based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. A team of present-day archaeologists are sent back in time to rescue their professor from medieval France in the middle of a battle. It stars Paul Walker, Frances O'Connor, Gerard Butler, Billy Connolly, David Thewlis and Anna Friel among others.\nJerry Goldsmith composed the original score, which would have been his last before his death in 2004, but it was replaced with a new score by Brian Tyler, after the first cut was re-edited and Goldsmith's increasing health problems did not allow him to continue. The film was poorly received by critics and was a box office failure."

Ambrose's 1992 non-fiction book of the same name. The executive producers were Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan. The episodes first aired in 2001 on HBO. The series won Emmy and Golden Globe awards in 2001 for best miniseries.\nThe series dramatizes the history of \"Easy\" Company (part of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division) from jump training in the United States through its participation in major actions in Europe, and up until Japan's capitulation and war's end. The events portrayed are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took literary license, adapting the recorded history for the purposes of dramatic effect and series structure. All of the characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Some of the men were recorded in contemporary interviews, which viewers see as preludes to each episode. The men's identities are not revealed until the finale.\nThe title for the book and the series comes from the St Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, delivered by Henry V of England before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by Carwood Lipton in the series' finale.",

The series took literary license, adapting the recorded history for the purposes of dramatic effect and series structure. All of the characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Some of the men were recorded in contemporary interviews, which viewers see as preludes to each episode. The men's identities are not revealed until the finale.\nThe title for the book and the series comes from the St Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, delivered by Henry V of England before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by Carwood Lipton in the series' finale."

The film stars Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris. The screenplay by William Broyles, Jr., and Al Reinert, that dramatizes the aborted 1970 Apollo 13 lunar mission, is an adaptation of the book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.\nThe film depicts astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise aboard Apollo 13 for America's third Moon landing mission. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power, forcing NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turning the mission into a struggle to get the three men home safely.",

And I know you want more of it more frequently. But in order for me to devote more time I need to be able to rely on History Buffs as a full time job. \n\nI feel Patreon is the best way to achieve that. I could finally move out of my mum's house and with the money I don't need to pay rent, I could hire new people to work on new shows in addition to the one I already make. \n\nJust by donating $1 per video will really help me. I usually only make 1 video a month anyway so that's only $1 a month!! YouTube is filled with people making videos that require no effort to make which is why they are able to churn out so many freaking many! I can't do that without compromising the quality of the content you are used to. Imagine if I made History Buffs videos that just showed Call of Duty game play that had nothing to do with the history I am talking about. That is literally a huge chunk of YouTube videos!! They're able to upload so many videos that they can make a profit on advertisement revenue.\n\nI can't compete with that because I believe in quality over quantity. So for the moment until History Buffs becomes large enough, Patreon is really the only way for me to achieve financial stability and to afford to make new shows. Thanks for reading this and supporting my channel!\nNick Hodges",

Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.\n\nThe film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"",

The biopic stars Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century Roman Egypt, who investigates the flaws of the geocentric Ptolemaic system and the heliocentric model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of classical antiquity from destruction. Max Minghella co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and Oscar Isaac as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, Orestes.\n\nThe story uses historical fiction to highlight the relationship between religion and science amidst the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism and the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The title of the film takes its name from the agora, a gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman forum. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of Malta from March to June 2008. Justin Pollard, co-author of The Rise and Fall of Alexandria (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.\n\nAgora was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in May, and opened in Spain on October 9, 2009 becoming the highest grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes and seven Goya Awards in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize at the Hamptons International Film Festival.",

It is a film adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate Henry Hill (the first-person narrator in the film) and his friends over a period from 1955 to 1980.\n\nGoodfellas is often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, both in the crime genre and in general. The film ranks #6 on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. In 2000, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other films and television shows. Scorsese followed up making this film with two more about organized crime: Casino (1995) and The Departed (2006).",

E. Lawrence. It was directed by David Lean and produced by Sam Spiegel through his British company Horizon Pictures, with the screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. The film stars Peter O'Toole in the title role. It is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential films in the history of cinema. The dramatic score by Maurice Jarre and the Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young are also highly acclaimed.[4] The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won seven in total including Best Director, Best Sound Editing, Best Film Editing, and Best Picture.\n\nThe film depicts Lawrence's experiences in the Arabian Peninsula during World War I, in particular his attacks on Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his own identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes.\n\nIn 1991, Lawrence of Arabia was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry.",

E. Lawrence. It was directed by David Lean and produced by Sam Spiegel through his British company Horizon Pictures, with the screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. The film stars Peter O'Toole in the title role. It is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential films in the history of cinema. The dramatic score by Maurice Jarre and the Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young are also highly acclaimed.[4] The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won seven in total including Best Director, Best Sound Editing, Best Film Editing, and Best Picture.\n\nThe film depicts Lawrence's experiences in the Arabian Peninsula during World War I, in particular his attacks on Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his own identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes.\n\nIn 1991, Lawrence of Arabia was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry."

I'm also getting my review of Alexander touched up and it should also be ready to be released within the next few days. My next review will be Lawrence of Arabia and I'm collaborating with an awesome YouTube channel I think you're gonna like ;)  \n\n\nI will update my twitter page @HistoryBuffsNH with news about HistoryVikingsPodcast and it would mean the world to me if you could share your questions and thoughts about HISTORY's Vikings Season 4 with me by using the hashtag #talkingvikings and connecting with me via the HISTORY Vikings Facebook page or email historyvikingspodcast@gmail.com.

I INTERVIEW GUSTAF SKARSGARD AND JENNIE JACQUES - \nYou can find all the episodes on iTunes and via Soundcloud\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/historyvikingspodcast\n\nAt the time of this upload, I'm back in Ireland. I just had a lovely chat with Maude Hirst who plays Helga and I'm working with such a great team. We're planning to release the first podcast this Friday and every Friday after until episode 10. I'm also getting my review of Alexander touched up and it should also be ready to be released within the next few days. My next review will be Lawrence of Arabia and I'm collaborating with an awesome YouTube channel I think you're gonna like ;)  \n\n\nI will update my twitter page @HistoryBuffsNH with news about HistoryVikingsPodcast and it would mean the world to me if you could share your questions and thoughts about HISTORY's Vikings Season 4 with me by using the hashtag #talkingvikings and connecting with me via the HISTORY Vikings Facebook page or email historyvikingspodcast@gmail.com.

Filmed in Ireland, it premiered on 3 March 2013 in the United States and Canada.\n\nVikings is inspired by the sagas of Viking Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France. The show portrays Ragnar as a former farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes king of Denmark, with the support of his family and fellow warriors: his brother Rollo, his son Bjorn Ironside, and his wives\u2014the shieldmaiden Lagertha and the princess Aslaug.\n\nThe series is inspired by the tales of the raiding, trading, and exploring Norsemen of early medieval Scandinavia. It follows the exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain Ragnar Lothbrok and his crew and family, as notably laid down in the 13th century sagas Ragnars saga Lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar and Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr, as well as in Saxo Grammaticus's 12th century work Gesta Danorum. Norse legendary sagas were partially fictional tales based in Norse oral tradition, written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on Lindisfarne depicted in the second episode, or Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th-century account of the Volga Vikings. The series is set at the beginning of the Viking Age, marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793",

Filmed in Ireland, it premiered on 3 March 2013 in the United States and Canada.\n\nVikings is inspired by the sagas of Viking Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France. The show portrays Ragnar as a former farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes king of Denmark, with the support of his family and fellow warriors: his brother Rollo, his son Bjorn Ironside, and his wives\u2014the shieldmaiden Lagertha and the princess Aslaug.\n\nThe series is inspired by the tales of the raiding, trading, and exploring Norsemen of early medieval Scandinavia. It follows the exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain Ragnar Lothbrok and his crew and family, as notably laid down in the 13th century sagas Ragnars saga Lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar and Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr, as well as in Saxo Grammaticus's 12th century work Gesta Danorum. Norse legendary sagas were partially fictional tales based in Norse oral tradition, written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on Lindisfarne depicted in the second episode, or Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th-century account of the Volga Vikings. The series is set at the beginning of the Viking Age, marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793",

Gibson portrays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. The story is based on Blind Harry's epic poem The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace and was adapted for the screen by Randall Wallace.\n\nThe film was nominated for ten Academy Awards at the 68th Academy Awards and won five: Best Picture, Best Makeup, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, and Best Director.\n\nRandall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film.[26] In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, \"Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.\"[26] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film which are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), [27] there are large parts which are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabelle).\n\nElizabeth Ewan describes Braveheart as a film which \"almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure\".[28] The \"brave heart\" refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, and an attribution by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, in his poem Heart of Bruce, to Sir James the Good Douglas: \"Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!\", prior to Douglas' demise at the Battle of Teba in Andalusia.[29] It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.[30]\n\nSharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of belted plaid by Wallace and his men. In that period \"no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone kilts of any kind).\" Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not \"in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film\". She compares the inaccuracy to \"a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around.\"[31] \"The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate\u2014in short, just about nothing is accurate.\"[32] The belted plaid (feileadh m\u00f3r l\u00e9ine) was not introduced until the 16th century.[33] Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace's \"farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with woad (1,000 years too late) running amok in a tartan kilt (500 years too early).\" [34]\n\nIn 2009, the film was second on a list of \"most historically inaccurate movies\" in The Times.[30] In the humorous non-fictional historiography An Utterly Impartial History of Britain (2007), author John O'Farrell notes that Braveheart could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a \"Plasticine dog\" had been inserted in the film and the title changed to William Wallace and Gromit.",
