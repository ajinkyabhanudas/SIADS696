In the late 1920s the US began testing their use as flying aircraft carriers, able to launch and recover planes from the air. This led to the construction of two airships: the USS Akron and its sister, USS Macon, among the largest airships ever built.\n\nThis is original content based on research by The History Guy.

NOAA\u2019s roots date back to 1807, when Thomas Jefferson established the nation\u2019s first scientific agency, the Survey of the Coast. Since then, NOAA has evolved to meet the needs of a changing country. NOAA maintains a presence in every state and has emerged as an international leader on scientific and environmental matters. \n \nThe Treasures of NOAA\u2019s Ark traveling exhibit showcases an array of heritage artifacts which tell the story of how the people, technology and resources shaped NOAA and its predecessor agencies over the past two decades. NOAA\u2019s responsibilities include preserving, protecting and promoting its own heritage while at the same time sharing this history with the public through innovative programs. \n \nThrough partnering with public institutions, the exhibit increases awareness about NOAA and provides examples of how the agency has impacted the everyday lives of citizens from coast to coast.   \n\nYou can purchase the bow tie worn in this episode at The Tie Bar: \nhttps://www.thetiebar.com/?utm_campaign=BowtieLove&utm_medium=YouTube&utm_source=LanceGeiger\n\nAll events are portrayed in historical context and for educational purposes.

                    "description": "The age of rigid and semi-rigid airships like the famous Hindenburg was a brief but exciting time, as the impressive ships promised to be part of a technological revolution.  In the late 1920s the US began testing their use as flying aircraft carriers, able to launch and recover planes from the air. This led to the construction of two airships: the USS Akron and its sister, USS Macon, among the largest airships ever built.\n\nThis is original content based on research by The History Guy.

As very few images of the actual event are available in the Public Domain, images of similar objects and events are used for illustration. \n\nTreasures of NOAA's Ark - currently on exhibition at the National Museum of the US Navy, Washington Navy Yard, DC until early November 2022.\n \nThe history of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the United States are intertwined. NOAA\u2019s roots date back to 1807, when Thomas Jefferson established the nation\u2019s first scientific agency, the Survey of the Coast. Since then, NOAA has evolved to meet the needs of a changing country. NOAA maintains a presence in every state and has emerged as an international leader on scientific and environmental matters. \n \nThe Treasures of NOAA\u2019s Ark traveling exhibit showcases an array of heritage artifacts which tell the story of how the people, technology and resources shaped NOAA and its predecessor agencies over the past two decades. NOAA\u2019s responsibilities include preserving, protecting and promoting its own heritage while at the same time sharing this history with the public through innovative programs. \n \nThrough partnering with public institutions, the exhibit increases awareness about NOAA and provides examples of how the agency has impacted the everyday lives of citizens from coast to coast.   \n\nYou can purchase the bow tie worn in this episode at The Tie Bar: \nhttps://www.thetiebar.com/?utm_campaign=BowtieLove&utm_medium=YouTube&utm_source=LanceGeiger\n\nAll events are portrayed in historical context and for educational purposes.

D-Day remains the largest seaborne invasion in history. In addition to the troops that landed, over 190,000 naval personnel and more than 6,900 ships were involved in the landing. Among them was the USS Texas. Commissioned in 1914, the Texas was one of seven battleships that took part in the landings, and played a key role providing fire support in the difficult landings at Omaha Beach. \n\nPlease support The Battleship Texas Foundation at https://battleshiptexas.org/donate/, where you can find official updates from the ship as well as a store in which you can buy things as a tax deductible donation, or make a donation.

D-Day remains the largest seaborne invasion in history. In addition to the troops that landed, over 190,000 naval personnel and more than 6,900 ships were involved in the landing. Among them was the USS Texas. Commissioned in 1914, the Texas was one of seven battleships that took part in the landings, and played a key role providing fire support in the difficult landings at Omaha Beach. \n\nPlease support The Battleship Texas Foundation at https://battleshiptexas.org/donate/, where you can find official updates from the ship as well as a store in which you can buy things as a tax deductible donation, or make a donation.
