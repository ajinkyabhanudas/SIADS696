Along this journey, viewers also learn about the history of each animal and its often-uncomfortable relationship with humans. Deadly wildlife featured over this ten-episode season includes the orange baboon tarantula, black-throated monitor lizard, red imported fire ants, brown widow, giant desert centipede, horrid king assassin bug, double bar rabbitfish, electric eel, California horn shark and blue tang \u2013 to name a few.  \n\n#KingsofPain\n\nSubscribe for more from Kings of Pain and other great The HISTORY Channel shows:\nhttp://histv.co/SubscribeHistoryYT\n\nFind out more about the series and watch full episodes on our site:\nhttps://www.history.com/shows/kings-of-pain\n\nCheck out exclusive HISTORY content:\nHistory Newsletter - https://histv.co/newsletter\nWebsite - https://histv.co/History\nFacebook - https://histv.co/Facebook\nTwitter - https://histv.co/Twitter\n\nLove Kings of Pain?

Cut the fat into 1-inch pieces and add to a medium saucepan.\n2. Trim any fat off the bison meat. Add the trimmed fat to the saucepan.\n3. Cook the fat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until fully melted. Any bits of meat should be browned, rendered, and sunken to the bottom of the pot. This should take about 4 hours. \n4. Strain the rendered fat through a fine-mesh strainer and set aside. \n5. Add a cooling rack to a sheet pan. Thinly slice the bison and arrange on the cooling rack. Dehydrate at 160F until totally dry, about 12 hours. Cool completely before processing.\n6. Grind the dried meat into a powder using a mortar & pestle. Add the ground meat to a bowl.\n7. Grind the chokeberries in the mortar & pestle. Add it to the bowl with the ground meat.\n8. Add the melted bison fat, kosher salt, and maple sugar to the meat & berry mixture.

Cook the fat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until fully melted. Any bits of meat should be browned, rendered, and sunken to the bottom of the pot. This should take about 4 hours. \n4. Strain the rendered fat through a fine-mesh strainer and set aside. \n5. Add a cooling rack to a sheet pan. Thinly slice the bison and arrange on the cooling rack. Dehydrate at 160F until totally dry, about 12 hours. Cool completely before processing.\n6. Grind the dried meat into a powder using a mortar & pestle. Add the ground meat to a bowl.\n7. Grind the chokeberries in the mortar & pestle. Add it to the bowl with the ground meat.\n8. Add the melted bison fat, kosher salt, and maple sugar to the meat & berry mixture. Use your hands to mix everything until well combined.\n9. Take a handful of the mixture and shape into patties. Let rest for about 30 minutes.\n\n#AncientRecipes\n\nSubscribe for more Ancient Recipes with Sohla and other great The HISTORY Channel shows:\nhttp://histv.co/SubscribeHistoryYT\n\nLearn more about The HISTORY Channel and watch full episodes on our site:\nhttps://history.com\n\nCheck out exclusive HISTORY content:\nHistory Newsletter - https://histv.co/newsletter\nWebsite - https://histv.co/History\nFacebook - https://histv.co/Facebook\nTwitter - https://histv.co/Twitter\n\nStay up to date on all of your favorite The HISTORY Channel shows at http://history.com/schedule.\n\nAncient Recipes with Sohla takes the food you know and love and traces it back to its origins.

Put on your lederhosen, grab a stein, and learn the strange religious history of our favorite salty snack.\n\nTHE RECIPE\n\nFor the pretzel dough:\n- 2/3-1 cup of Beer Barm\n- 3 cups of whole wheat flour\n- 3/4 cups of water\n- 1 1/2 tsps of salt\n- 2-3 tbsps of softened butter\n\nFor the pretzel topping:\n- 2 tsps pretzel salt\n\nFor serving:\n- Melted butter\n\n1. Mix together the flour, salt, softened butter & beer barm until you form a shaggy mass. \n2. Knead the dough until it is consistent & fail smooth. It should be a little sticky. If it seems dry, add a little more water.\n3. Cover the dough & let it rise for 45 minutes.\n4. Uncover the dough & cut it in half. Gently flatten the dough to disperse the gases.\n5. Roll the dough into a long rope about 1\u201d thick making sure to apply pressure outwards & not down.\n6. Place the dough rope in a U-shape facing away from you on the table. Twist the ends & folds them back onto the thick part of the rope to form the pretzel.\n7. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly & gently add the pretzels. Boil for 45 seconds before removing.\n8. Make a slash about 1/4\u201d deep on the bottom of the pretzel. Add the pretzel salt while it is still wet.\n9. Preheat a seasoned baking stone in the oven to 450 degrees.\n10. Add the pretzels to the baking stone & cook for about 15 minutes.\n11. Take the pretzels out and brush with melted butter.\n\nAncient Recipes with Sohla takes the food you know and love and traces it back to its origins.

When he sees a car he wants, he will do whatever it takes to get his hands on it-including making on-the-spot cash offers to unsuspecting owners. On the HISTORY series Counting Cars, Danny and his team restore, customize and sell cars in a hurry, scrambling to keep their Las Vegas shop in the black. From classics to exotics, from hotrods to choppers, Danny and the crew of Count's Kustoms will stop at nothing to find and flip the greatest rides of all time.\n\nThe HISTORY\u00ae Channel is the leading destination for award-winning original series and specials that connect viewers with history in an informative, immersive, and entertaining manner across all platforms.

                "description": "The Colosseum, a new 8-part premium documentary series, premieres July 17 at 9pm ET/PT on The History Channel.\n\nThe Ancient Recipes kitchen gets real fishy as Sohla cooks up garum, a fermented fish sauce that was incredibly popular in Ancient Rome, alongside a Roman-style roasted boar. Plus, to get some garum advice, Sohla reaches out to Max Miller to learn all about the sauce's history.\n\nCheck out Tasting History with Max Miller here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaGKqPZnGp_7N80hcHySGQ\n\nRecipe for Garum:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 quart water\n- \u00bd - 1 pound kosher salt\n- 1 tablespoon dried oregano \n- \u00bd cup sapa (grape must reduction)\n- 1 - 2 pounds whole mackerel\n\nSteps:\n1. Add the water to a medium pot. Add the salt, heating and stirring to dissolve, until it\u2019s dense enough for an egg to float. \n2. Add oregano, sapa, and mackerel.\n3. Bring to a boil and simmer, breaking up the fish occasionally, for 40 minutes. \n4. Cool the mixture before straining. First, strain through a metal sieve to get the big bits. Then through moistened cheesecloth to get the finer bits. And finally through moistened linen to get the last bits. \n\nRecipe for Roast Boar:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 boar shanks\n- 9 grams peppercorn\n- 7 grams rue\n- 7 grams lovage\n- 7 grams celery seed\n- 7 grams juniper berries\n- 7 grams dried thyme\n- 7 grams dried mint\n- 3.5 grams fleabane\n- Honey\n- Vinegar\n- Colatura di alici and/or Garum\n- Banana leaves\n\nSteps:\n1. In a mortar and pestle, grind the herbs and spices into a fine powder.\n2. Combine the powder with a \"sufficient amount\" of honey and vinegar (enough to combine the mixture into a paste).\n3. Divide the mixture into two medium bowls. Add garum to one bowl and colatura di alici to another.\n4. Add a shank to each bowl and coat in the mixture.\n5. Line two testa (dutch ovens) with banana leaves. Add one shank to each, cover, and roast at 325F until tender (about 2 to 3 hours).\n\nSubscribe for more Ancient Recipes with Sohla and other great The HISTORY Channel shows:\nhttp://histv.co/SubscribeHistoryYT\n\nAncient Recipes with Sohla takes the food you know and love and traces it back to its origins.

                    "description": "The Colosseum, a new 8-part premium documentary series, premieres July 17 at 9pm ET/PT on The History Channel.\n\nThe Ancient Recipes kitchen gets real fishy as Sohla cooks up garum, a fermented fish sauce that was incredibly popular in Ancient Rome, alongside a Roman-style roasted boar. Plus, to get some garum advice, Sohla reaches out to Max Miller to learn all about the sauce's history.\n\nCheck out Tasting History with Max Miller here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaGKqPZnGp_7N80hcHySGQ\n\nRecipe for Garum:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 quart water\n- \u00bd - 1 pound kosher salt\n- 1 tablespoon dried oregano \n- \u00bd cup sapa (grape must reduction)\n- 1 - 2 pounds whole mackerel\n\nSteps:\n1. Add the water to a medium pot. Add the salt, heating and stirring to dissolve, until it\u2019s dense enough for an egg to float. \n2. Add oregano, sapa, and mackerel.\n3. Bring to a boil and simmer, breaking up the fish occasionally, for 40 minutes. \n4. Cool the mixture before straining. First, strain through a metal sieve to get the big bits. Then through moistened cheesecloth to get the finer bits. And finally through moistened linen to get the last bits. \n\nRecipe for Roast Boar:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 boar shanks\n- 9 grams peppercorn\n- 7 grams rue\n- 7 grams lovage\n- 7 grams celery seed\n- 7 grams juniper berries\n- 7 grams dried thyme\n- 7 grams dried mint\n- 3.5 grams fleabane\n- Honey\n- Vinegar\n- Colatura di alici and/or Garum\n- Banana leaves\n\nSteps:\n1. In a mortar and pestle, grind the herbs and spices into a fine powder.\n2. Combine the powder with a \"sufficient amount\" of honey and vinegar (enough to combine the mixture into a paste).\n3. Divide the mixture into two medium bowls. Add garum to one bowl and colatura di alici to another.\n4. Add a shank to each bowl and coat in the mixture.\n5. Line two testa (dutch ovens) with banana leaves. Add one shank to each, cover, and roast at 325F until tender (about 2 to 3 hours).\n\nSubscribe for more Ancient Recipes with Sohla and other great The HISTORY Channel shows:\nhttp://histv.co/SubscribeHistoryYT\n\nAncient Recipes with Sohla takes the food you know and love and traces it back to its origins.

                "description": "The HISTORY\u00ae Channel\u2019s hit historical drama series \u201cVikings\u201d finalizes its powerful and deeply compelling six-season saga with a highly-anticipated two-hour broadcast premiere on Saturday, June 5 at 8PM ET/PT. The final ten episodes unfold to reveal the inevitable fates of the sons of the late Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) and other beloved characters. Over the years, The HISTORY\u00ae Channel viewers lived vicariously through the enthralling adventures of these Viking warriors which included prosperous raids across England, crowning achievements ruling Kattegat and detrimental losses both on and off the battlefield. As the last season makes its broadcast debut, the drama only intensifies which means the complexities of war between brothers are far from over. \n\nThe remaining eight episodes of the final season follow Saturdays back-to-back each week (excluding June 19) at 8PM ET/PT on The HISTORY\u00ae Channel. Additionally, a one-hour special \u201cVIKINGS: The Saga of The Vikings\u201d airs ahead of the June 5 premiere at 7PM ET/PT; it finds Bjorn reunited with his brothers Ivar and Hvitserk for a strange gathering after Bjorn is gravely injured in battle. As they share tales of the exploits of their people and prophecies of Ragnar\u00f6k, it becomes clear this is not a simple reunion. \n\n#Vikings\n\nSubscribe for more from Vikings and other great The HISTORY Channel shows:\nhttp://histv.co/SubscribeHistoryYT\n\nWatch more Vikings on YouTube in this playlist:\nhttps://histv.co/WatchVikings\n\nFind out more about the show and watch full episodes on our site:\nhttps://histv.co/Vikings\n\nCheck out exclusive The HISTORY Channel content:\nHistory Newsletter - https://histv.co/newsletter\nWebsite - https://histv.co/History\nFacebook - https://histv.co/Facebook\nTwitter - https://histv.co/Twitter\n\n\"Vikings\" transports us to the brutal world of Ragnar Lothbrok, a Viking warrior and farmer who yearns to explore\u2014and raid\u2014the distant shores across the ocean as ambition and innovation rattle his civilization.\n\nHISTORY\u00ae is the leading destination for award-winning original series and specials that connect viewers with history in an informative, immersive, and entertaining manner across all platforms.

Watch new episodes every other Saturday and check out more here:\nhttp://histv.co/ancientrecipes\n\nFollow Adam Richman as he travels the country and tries the most iconic and forgotten foods of the 1980s.\u00a0Watch new episodes of\u00a0Adam Eats the 80s\u00a0Sundays\u00a0at 10/9c on The History Channel.\n\nPizza has been around for so long it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact origins. In this episode, Sohla El-Waylly tries to recreate one of the coolest ancient versions of pizza just how 6th century BCE Persian soldiers would have made it: on their shields! #AncientRecipes\n\nRecipe for Nan-e Barbari:\n\nFor the dough:\n1 1/5 cups lukewarm water\n1/2 cup beer yeast\n2 cups whole wheat flour\n2 teaspoons of salt\n\nFor the glaze:\n2 teaspoons of whole wheat flour\n1/2 teaspoon of olive oil\n1/3 cup of water\n\nFor the toppings:\n1/2 cup of halloumi\n1/2 cup of dates\n\nDirections:\n1. Mix all of the dough ingredients together until well combined into a sticky dough.\n2. Knead the dough until it is a smooth, fairly soft dough.\n3. Put the dough on a lightly oiled shield. Cover the shield with a towel & let the dough proof for 1 hour.\n4. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough & divide it into two pieces. Shape the pieces into a rough log about 9\u201d long. Tent with a damp cloth and proof for another 30 minutes.\n5. Preheat the oven to 450 F.\n6. Combine the glaze ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.\n7. Once boiling, continue cooking over medium heat stirring constantly until the glaze thickens & coats the spoon - around a minute.\n8.

Watch new episodes every other Saturday and check out more here:\nhttp://histv.co/ancientrecipes\n\nFollow Adam Richman as he travels the country and tries the most iconic and forgotten foods of the 1980s.\u00a0Watch new episodes of\u00a0Adam Eats the 80s\u00a0Sundays\u00a0at 10/9c on The History Channel.\n\nPizza has been around for so long it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact origins. In this episode, Sohla El-Waylly tries to recreate one of the coolest ancient versions of pizza just how 6th century BCE Persian soldiers would have made it: on their shields! #AncientRecipes\n\nRecipe for Nan-e Barbari:\n\nFor the dough:\n1 1/5 cups lukewarm water\n1/2 cup beer yeast\n2 cups whole wheat flour\n2 teaspoons of salt\n\nFor the glaze:\n2 teaspoons of whole wheat flour\n1/2 teaspoon of olive oil\n1/3 cup of water\n\nFor the toppings:\n1/2 cup of halloumi\n1/2 cup of dates\n\nDirections:\n1. Mix all of the dough ingredients together until well combined into a sticky dough.\n2. Knead the dough until it is a smooth, fairly soft dough.\n3. Put the dough on a lightly oiled shield. Cover the shield with a towel & let the dough proof for 1 hour.\n4. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough & divide it into two pieces. Shape the pieces into a rough log about 9\u201d long. Tent with a damp cloth and proof for another 30 minutes.\n5. Preheat the oven to 450 F.\n6. Combine the glaze ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.\n7. Once boiling, continue cooking over medium heat stirring constantly until the glaze thickens & coats the spoon - around a minute.\n8. Remove the glaze from the heat and set aside to cool enough to handle.\n9. Place the shield in the oven to preheat it.\n10. Deflate the dough. Use your fingers to press 5 lengthwise grooves into the dough without cutting through the dough.\n11. Spread the glaze on each dough, rubbing it all over.\n12. Put the dough on the preheated shield. Bake for about 7-8 minutes.\n13. Flip the dough, add the dates & halloumi. Bake for another 7-8 minutes. \n\nSubscribe for more Ancient Recipes with Sohla and other great The HISTORY Channel shows:\nhttp://histv.co/SubscribeHistoryYT\n\nCheck out exclusive The HISTORY Channel content:\nHistory Newsletter - https://histv.co/newsletter\nWebsite - https://histv.co/History\nFacebook - https://histv.co/Facebook\nTwitter - https://histv.co/Twitter\n\nAncient Recipes with Sohla takes the food you know and love and traces it back to its origins.

Each of the eight chapters is told from the perspective of different biblical figures, all of whom played a pivotal role in Jesus\u2019 life including Joseph, John the Baptist, Mary Mother of Jesus, Caiaphas, Judas Iscariot, Pontius Pilate, Mary Magdalene, and Peter.\n\nEach figure takes a turn guiding viewers through the emotional and epic story of the most famous man in history, through his birth, death, and resurrection, all conveyed through a combination of scripted drama and interviews with prominent religious and historical experts. Utilizing some of the world\u2019s most respected Biblical scholars, historians, faith leaders, and theologians, the series weaves together the canonical Gospels, historical sources and cultural context to create a complete portrait of Jesus \u2013 the man and the Messiah. The series reveals his journey through a complex world of kings, politicians, reformers, and soldiers in a turbulent power struggle during a time of revolutionary change. \u201cJesus: His Life\u201d brings viewers into this dramatic world to reveal the greatest story ever told.
