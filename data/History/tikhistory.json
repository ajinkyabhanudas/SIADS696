I am genuinely recommending this based on the fact that it has contributed significantly to the historiography surrounding this topic. I've used the first edition of this book for years now (since 2019 at least) and have been recommending it since then. Want proof?

Finally, you can get your hands on what is in my opinion by far the best book assessing Hitler and his ideology.\n\nDisclaimers: I'm NOT a Nazi, nor a Fascist, nor a Marxist, or a believer in any other ideology. The purpose of this video is to educate people and learn from history so that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\nThis is NOT a sponsored video and I'm NOT making any commission by recommending this book. I am genuinely recommending this based on the fact that it has contributed significantly to the historiography surrounding this topic. I've used the first edition of this book for years now (since 2019 at least) and have been recommending it since then. Want proof? Here's a 5 hour video on Hitler's Socialism where I quote from the book multiple times: https://youtu.be/eCkyWBPaTC8\n\nFollow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/tikhistory/\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe thumbnail for this video was created by Terri Young.

We\u2019re going to answer the question: was the Weimar Republic weak? And we\u2019re also going to hear the story of how one man single-handedly saved Austria from a Bolshevik Revolution.

Since then, he has realized that the Holocaust did occur, and has spoken out against the 'revisionists' and deniers. In this video, we're going to see what he said and why, in the hope that other deniers realize the error of their ways. (Thank you to Ted for asking today's question.)\n\nTo the YouTube censors: I'm NOT a Nazi, nor a Fascist, nor a Marxist, nor do I believe in any other evil totalitarian ideology. I'm defending the Holocaust, NOT denying it, even though I am talking about a Holocaust denier.

In this third video, we\u2019re going to take a look at some of the counter-arguments against the idea that Operation Keelhaul even happened, or if it did, whether it was a true crime or not.\n\nTo the YouTube censors: I'm NOT a Nazi, nor a Fascist, nor a Marxist, nor do I believe in any other evil totalitarian ideology. In fact, I spend the majority of this video addressing those that deny the history of the crimes they created. The purpose of this video is to study history so that we can avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.

In this third video, we\u2019re going to take a look at some of the counter-arguments against the idea that Operation Keelhaul even happened, or if it did, whether it was a true crime or not.\n\nTo the YouTube censors: I'm NOT a Nazi, nor a Fascist, nor a Marxist, nor do I believe in any other evil totalitarian ideology. In fact, I spend the majority of this video addressing those that deny the history of the crimes they created. The purpose of this video is to study history so that we can avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.

When we consider the oil crisis, and the fuel and logistical situation, this seems self-evident: Hitler must have been insane to build massive tanks at a time when he knew there was a lack of fuel (either that or the oil crisis narrative is wrong)! But is this really the case? Well, here in this video I\u2019m going to defend my stance on the Axis oil crisis narrative, and explain why the initial reasons for building the German heavy and super-heavy tanks were justified (even if they later proved to be stupid in hindsight).\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe thumbnail was created by Terri Young.

                    "description": "It is usually stated that \u2018Madman Hitler\u2019 wasted a load of resources and production capacity building the German heavy and super-heavy tanks in WW2. When we consider the oil crisis, and the fuel and logistical situation, this seems self-evident: Hitler must have been insane to build massive tanks at a time when he knew there was a lack of fuel (either that or the oil crisis narrative is wrong)! But is this really the case? Well, here in this video I\u2019m going to defend my stance on the Axis oil crisis narrative, and explain why the initial reasons for building the German heavy and super-heavy tanks were justified (even if they later proved to be stupid in hindsight).\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe thumbnail was created by Terri Young.

He was also the Reichsminister of Economics between 1934 and 1937, playing a central role in financing the Third Reich's rearmament programme in the build up to war. Schacht also helped set up the Bank of International Settlements (the BIS) in 1930. So why did Hitler hire him? And why did Hitler fire him?

Even with the 3rd Romanian Army moving in, there's simply not enough divisions to go around. Worse, the replacements the Germans are sending to the Eastern Front aren't reaching Army Group B and it's the OKH's fault.

Well, this argument quickly falls apart when we look at the map of Europe and think critically, which this video will show.\n\nCorrection: As many people have pointed out, I said 1938 instead of 1939 at 9:20 in the video.

Using various sources (full bibliography linked below) and studying the memoirs of Albert Kesselring (the Luftwaffe commander), it should be possible to decide whether this was a deliberate act, or an accident as some have claimed. And it should be possible to pin the blame on the person(s) responsible.\n\nNote: I put the wrong name for the quote at ~10:30, it was von Lingen, not Macksey.\n\nThe thumbnail for this video was created by Terri Young.

                "description": "On the 14th of September 1942, Stalingrad was on the brink. The Germans were in the centre of the city, were pushing onto Mamaev Kurgan, and were collapsing 62nd Army's defenses in the south. Chuikov had nothing left, and so it looked like the city was about to fall. There was only one hope. Rodimtsev's 13th Guards Rifle Division would have to cross the Volga and perform an amphibious landing and charge straight into battle. The only question is - did they have enough rifles? Or was the film \"Enemy at the Gates\" correct in assuming there was one guy with a rifle and one guy with bullets?

                    "description": "On the 14th of September 1942, Stalingrad was on the brink. The Germans were in the centre of the city, were pushing onto Mamaev Kurgan, and were collapsing 62nd Army's defenses in the south. Chuikov had nothing left, and so it looked like the city was about to fall. There was only one hope. Rodimtsev's 13th Guards Rifle Division would have to cross the Volga and perform an amphibious landing and charge straight into battle. The only question is - did they have enough rifles? Or was the film \"Enemy at the Gates\" correct in assuming there was one guy with a rifle and one guy with bullets?

This is the result of purely looking at the military operations and not understanding the political side of the equation. To explain this, in this documentary we will explore the situation in the last years of the Weimar Republic, see the conflict between Hitler and Kurt von Schleicher (a conservative army officer), see how similar or dis-similar their goals were, and figure out the reason why Hitler didn't trust his generals.

                    "description": "Some believe that Hitler's distrust of his generals, and his constant attempts to control them, are evidence of his 'madness'. This is the result of purely looking at the military operations and not understanding the political side of the equation. To explain this, in this documentary we will explore the situation in the last years of the Weimar Republic, see the conflict between Hitler and Kurt von Schleicher (a conservative army officer), see how similar or dis-similar their goals were, and figure out the reason why Hitler didn't trust his generals.

In this history documentary, we\u2019ll see how close Paulus\u2019 infantry and StuGs came to Chuikov\u2019s headquarters, with the commander of the 62nd Army having to throw in NKVD police, militia units and dogs to try and stem the tide!\n\nProbable error: I\u2019m not convinced I got the front lines correct when referring to the fighting around the Central Railway Station from around 35:18 in the video onwards. Thinking about it, I now suspect that the lines should have stopped after the Germans took the station, allowing the Soviets to retake it a couple of times at that point, before the lines moved on towards the Volga and the Fallen Fighters Square. Thus, when the 10th NKVD Division (and the dogs) retake the station in the video (e.g. at 42:30 ), the Germans probably weren\u2019t in the buildings on their right flank. I mean, it could have happened this way, but it seems unlikely.

                "description": "As the Battle of Stalingrad rages, Franz Halder tries to shift the blame to Hitler and Paulus in order to cover for his own mistakes... at least, that's one theory as to what happened at the Vinnitsa Conference on the 12th of September 1942. But it's not the only event that happened that day. Chuikov is also made 62nd Army's commander, and crosses the Volga into the city of Stalingrad in order to take command of his new forces. We also see the last gasp of the 1st Kotluban Offensive, Zhukov's account about a meeting he had with Stalin (which may not have even happened), and take a look at the state of both German and Soviet formations on the eve of the city fight itself.\n\nCorrection: I displayed the name \u201cKempf\u201d as the author of the final quote, but it was Hoth, not Kempf. I put the correct unit card in, and the reference is correct. It\u2019s just the name under the quote :( when I noticed it was too late to go back and sort it.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00 Part 1 - Events on the 12th of September 1942, including 04:25 the end of the 1st Kotluban Offensive, the meeting at the Kremlin 08:50 , and 11:34 Chuikov's appointment as 62nd Army's commander\n18:05 Part 2 - The Vinnitsa Conference and Halder's shifting of the blame\n41:24 Part 3 - The unit positions on the eve of the city fight & the first real look at the new Stalingrad city map!\n\nThe AMAZING MAPS for this series were created by Terri Young, and the video was edited by her too.

                    "description": "As the Battle of Stalingrad rages, Franz Halder tries to shift the blame to Hitler and Paulus in order to cover for his own mistakes... at least, that's one theory as to what happened at the Vinnitsa Conference on the 12th of September 1942. But it's not the only event that happened that day. Chuikov is also made 62nd Army's commander, and crosses the Volga into the city of Stalingrad in order to take command of his new forces. We also see the last gasp of the 1st Kotluban Offensive, Zhukov's account about a meeting he had with Stalin (which may not have even happened), and take a look at the state of both German and Soviet formations on the eve of the city fight itself.\n\nCorrection: I displayed the name \u201cKempf\u201d as the author of the final quote, but it was Hoth, not Kempf. I put the correct unit card in, and the reference is correct. It\u2019s just the name under the quote :( when I noticed it was too late to go back and sort it.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00 Part 1 - Events on the 12th of September 1942, including 04:25 the end of the 1st Kotluban Offensive, the meeting at the Kremlin 08:50 , and 11:34 Chuikov's appointment as 62nd Army's commander\n18:05 Part 2 - The Vinnitsa Conference and Halder's shifting of the blame\n41:24 Part 3 - The unit positions on the eve of the city fight & the first real look at the new Stalingrad city map!\n\nThe AMAZING MAPS for this series were created by Terri Young, and the video was edited by her too.

                    "description": "The traditional western narrative suggests that Poland was beset on both sides by two aggressive powers. Whereas, two other narratives (including the Soviet one, which Vladimir Putin champions) attempt to claim that Poland's aggressive foreign policy resulted in her own destruction. In today's question, I'm going to explain why the traditional western narrative makes more sense than the other two.

                "description": "In 1937, Hitler and his top generals had a meeting where they discussed their future war plans, with the invasions of Austria and Czechoslovakia assured, and a conflicts with Poland, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union predicted. This meeting was called the 'Hossbach Memorandum', after Colonel Friedrich Hossbach, who was the guy who recorded what was said at the meeting. However, this meeting, and the source, has been disputed most notably by Nazis and Holocaust Deniers, but also some old historians in the 1960s, who have tried to dismiss the whole thing. In this video, we'll take a look at the source, and discuss whether the meeting actually happened or not, and whether what was said in the meeting was said or not.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe thumbnail for this video was created by Graphic Designer Terri Young.

                    "description": "In 1937, Hitler and his top generals had a meeting where they discussed their future war plans, with the invasions of Austria and Czechoslovakia assured, and a conflicts with Poland, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union predicted. This meeting was called the 'Hossbach Memorandum', after Colonel Friedrich Hossbach, who was the guy who recorded what was said at the meeting. However, this meeting, and the source, has been disputed most notably by Nazis and Holocaust Deniers, but also some old historians in the 1960s, who have tried to dismiss the whole thing. In this video, we'll take a look at the source, and discuss whether the meeting actually happened or not, and whether what was said in the meeting was said or not.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe thumbnail for this video was created by Graphic Designer Terri Young.

The Halt Order has been viewed as one of the \"most critical mistakes\" of the war... and yet, the jury is out on the reasons behind it. Was the Halt Order issued without clear reasoning?

Recently, his diaries were published in a book called \"My Opposition\" (which I highly recommend you get if you're interested). In this video, we take a brief look into these diary entries, with a focus on the food and oil crisis that was going on at the time, and see if this tallies up with other sources (like Goebbel's Diaries, and G\u00f6tz Aly's \"Hitler's Beneficiaries\"). Kellner gives us enough evidence to confirm many of the theories already presented on this channel - you can find the video links below.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nDEAR YOUTUBE CENSOR - the purpose of this HISTORY documentary video is to educate people so that we can hopefully avoid repeating the mistakes that previous generations have made.

                    "description": "Friedrich Kellner was a German Social Democrat who found himself living in the Third Reich during WW2. Recently, his diaries were published in a book called \"My Opposition\" (which I highly recommend you get if you're interested). In this video, we take a brief look into these diary entries, with a focus on the food and oil crisis that was going on at the time, and see if this tallies up with other sources (like Goebbel's Diaries, and G\u00f6tz Aly's \"Hitler's Beneficiaries\"). Kellner gives us enough evidence to confirm many of the theories already presented on this channel - you can find the video links below.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nDEAR YOUTUBE CENSOR - the purpose of this HISTORY documentary video is to educate people so that we can hopefully avoid repeating the mistakes that previous generations have made. I'm not a Nazi, nor am I promoting Hitler's evil ideology - in fact, this video exposes how terrible National Socialism actually was. The video is also backed by the sources listed below.

Using multiple sources, it's time to provide YouTube with a narrative which doesn't confirm nationalist beliefs. The Habsburgs survived the collapse, with Emperor Karl / Charles trying to reclaim his throne later on before being exiled. However, by about mid-November 1918, he had lost all power. The fact that there is no specific date when Austria-Hungary collapsed, and the fact that the 'national revolutions' were met with relatively little opposition, speaks volumes. As does the fact that the new states were all multinational, which undermines the narrative that nationalism was the reason why Austria-Hungary collapsed.

We can compare them to other Chetnik movements as well as to Tito's Communist 'Partisans' and see if we can figure out what the historical truth really is.\n\nToday's question was asked by Habrsoa.

Greece was occupied by the Axis powers in April 1941 and suffered terribly in the subsequent years, with their economy plundered, their people starved by famine (known as the 'Great Famine' or '\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2' in Greek), the Jews of Salonika shipped off to Auschwitz as part of the Holocaust, and their currency (the drachma) hyperinflated into oblivion. It's no wonder a resistance movement sprang up, and that Greece ended up in a Civil War that lasted (on and off) until 1949. This video was created in the hope that we can learn from history and prevent such a tragedy from happening again.

                    "description": "This documentary describes some of the horrors that the Greek people went through under German (National Socialist), Italian (Fascist) and Bulgarian rule, covering mainland Greece (specifically Athens), the islands of Syros, Cephalonia (Kefalonia) and Kalymnos, amongst others. Greece was occupied by the Axis powers in April 1941 and suffered terribly in the subsequent years, with their economy plundered, their people starved by famine (known as the 'Great Famine' or '\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2' in Greek), the Jews of Salonika shipped off to Auschwitz as part of the Holocaust, and their currency (the drachma) hyperinflated into oblivion. It's no wonder a resistance movement sprang up, and that Greece ended up in a Civil War that lasted (on and off) until 1949. This video was created in the hope that we can learn from history and prevent such a tragedy from happening again.

But if you disagree, let me know!\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\n- - - - -\n\n\ud83d\udcda BIBLIOGRAPHY / SOURCES \ud83d\udcda\n\nThe specific Battlestorm Stalingrad bibliography https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_wRCV_bRBEryKB5l3uE-ZzMUPIGF6QyyrR5XpNXOGw/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFull list of all my sources https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/114GiK85MPs0v4GKm0izPj3DL2CrlJUdAantx5GQUKn8/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- - - - -\n\n\u2b50 SUPPORT TIK \u2b50\n\nWant to ask a question?

                "description": "Can you trust ANYTHING that David Irving wrote? In 1996, David Irving sued Deborah Lipstadt for libel (in the \"Irving vs Penguin Books Ltd\" trial) because Deborah Lipstadt had said Irving was a Holocaust Denier. Historian Richard Evans was called upon as an expert witness, and he examined Irving's works for two years, discovering many major factual errors in David Irving's works. Richard Evans came to the conclusion that Irving cannot even be classed as a 'historian', and says \"not one sentence\" in any of his speeches or written works can be trusted. Richard Evan's \"Telling Lies About Hitler\" presents a solid case against David Irving that casts serious doubt about every 'historical' text that Irving wrote, and this video presents 3 examples from Evan's brilliant book (this video is not a sponsored video, I genuinely think Evan's book is brilliant and you should get yourself a copy) that really should make you question the opinions of those who still promote Irving's works.\n\nHolocaust deniers may continue to deny that the 'Final Solution to the Jewish Question' took place, but in actively distorting the evidence, they undermine their own cause. The term 'distorian' describes their 'writers' better than the term 'historian'.\n\nAnd, in case it isn't blatantly obvious, I'm NOT a Fascist, NOT a Nazi, NOT a Marxist, and am NOT promoting said evil ideologies. This video is for educational and historical purposes, so that we may learn from the past and prevent it from repeating.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\n- - - - -\n\n\ud83d\udcda BIBLIOGRAPHY / SOURCES \ud83d\udcda\n\nEvans, R. \u201cIn Defence of History.\u201d Granta Books, Kindle.\nEvans, R. \"Telling Lies About Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial.\" Verso, 2002.\nIrving, D. \"Hitler's War:1939-1942.\" PAPERMAC 1983.\nIrving, D. \"Hitler's War:1942-1945.\" PAPERMAC 1983.\nLipstadt, D. \"Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.\" Penguin Books, 2016.\nRees, L. \"The Holocaust: A New History.\" Penguin Books, 2017.\nSeidel, G. \"The Holocaust Denial: Antisemitism, Racism, & the New Right.\" Beyond the Pale Collective, 1986.\nShermer, M.

                    "description": "Can you trust ANYTHING that David Irving wrote? In 1996, David Irving sued Deborah Lipstadt for libel (in the \"Irving vs Penguin Books Ltd\" trial) because Deborah Lipstadt had said Irving was a Holocaust Denier. Historian Richard Evans was called upon as an expert witness, and he examined Irving's works for two years, discovering many major factual errors in David Irving's works. Richard Evans came to the conclusion that Irving cannot even be classed as a 'historian', and says \"not one sentence\" in any of his speeches or written works can be trusted. Richard Evan's \"Telling Lies About Hitler\" presents a solid case against David Irving that casts serious doubt about every 'historical' text that Irving wrote, and this video presents 3 examples from Evan's brilliant book (this video is not a sponsored video, I genuinely think Evan's book is brilliant and you should get yourself a copy) that really should make you question the opinions of those who still promote Irving's works.\n\nHolocaust deniers may continue to deny that the 'Final Solution to the Jewish Question' took place, but in actively distorting the evidence, they undermine their own cause. The term 'distorian' describes their 'writers' better than the term 'historian'.\n\nAnd, in case it isn't blatantly obvious, I'm NOT a Fascist, NOT a Nazi, NOT a Marxist, and am NOT promoting said evil ideologies. This video is for educational and historical purposes, so that we may learn from the past and prevent it from repeating.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\n- - - - -\n\n\ud83d\udcda BIBLIOGRAPHY / SOURCES \ud83d\udcda\n\nEvans, R. \u201cIn Defence of History.\u201d Granta Books, Kindle.\nEvans, R. \"Telling Lies About Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial.\" Verso, 2002.\nIrving, D. \"Hitler's War:1939-1942.\" PAPERMAC 1983.\nIrving, D. \"Hitler's War:1942-1945.\" PAPERMAC 1983.\nLipstadt, D. \"Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.\" Penguin Books, 2016.\nRees, L. \"The Holocaust: A New History.\" Penguin Books, 2017.\nSeidel, G. \"The Holocaust Denial: Antisemitism, Racism, & the New Right.\" Beyond the Pale Collective, 1986.\nShermer, M.

But this story is suspicious to say the least. Alfred Naujocks is our main source of information, and claims that he was the man who started WW2. But he contradicts himself in his various accounts of what happened. We're not even sure what date it actually took place, or if it took place at all. So today we explore the Gleiwitz Incident and attempt to answer the question raised by my Patreon, Vinny Siracusa, as to whether it actually happened or not, or if it did, when. Was Alfred Naujocks REALLY the man who started WW2?\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\n- - - - -\n\n\u2b50 SUPPORT TIK \u2b50\n\nWant to ask a question?

They were desperately low on man power after the war and much of their supplies were in the Urals. Did they move the factories back west as soon as possible and etc?\n\nWell, after reading a couple of books recently that mentioned the fact that the Soviet Union hadn't recovered from WW2 by the mid-1960s, I decided to investigate further... So, let's answer both Mitchell's and my own question - when, or did, the Soviet Union EVER Recover from WW2?\n\nOh, and should I just 'Stick to Tanks'? https://youtu.be/FgyYkLqEyh8\n\nThis video was edited by Terri Young https://www.terriyoungdesigns.co.uk/\n\nVideos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\n- - - - -\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY / SOURCES\n\nSpecific bibliography for this video -\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bmH9htON6l1Ku58ppC9R6aRaxD-xAc0FOLpp07lIPJs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFull list of all my sources https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/114GiK85MPs0v4GKm0izPj3DL2CrlJUdAantx5GQUKn8/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- - - - -\n\nSUPPORT TIK\n\nWant to ask a question?

These people argue that the Waffen-SS recruited non-Germans, which supposedly \"proves\" how \"diverse\" and \"inclusive\" the German Army was in WW2. Clearly, that view is total rubbish, as this video will make clear. And, in the process of answering this question, we'll discover just how INSANE Heinrich Himmler and Nazi ideology really were.\n\nAnd it should be fairly obvious, but just to make sure everyone's fully aware - I am NOT a Fascist, NOT a National Socialist, and NOT a Marxist Socialist.

                    "description": "My Patron - So long, John - is concerned that some people online are claiming that the Nazis were \u201cjust racially conscious\" rather than full-on racist. These people argue that the Waffen-SS recruited non-Germans, which supposedly \"proves\" how \"diverse\" and \"inclusive\" the German Army was in WW2. Clearly, that view is total rubbish, as this video will make clear. And, in the process of answering this question, we'll discover just how INSANE Heinrich Himmler and Nazi ideology really were.\n\nAnd it should be fairly obvious, but just to make sure everyone's fully aware - I am NOT a Fascist, NOT a National Socialist, and NOT a Marxist Socialist. And I am NOT promoting said ideologies. This video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature. This video is for informational purposes and was created so we may better understand the past and learn from the mistakes others have made.\n\nVideos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\n- - - - -\n\nSUPPORT TIK\n\nWant to ask a question?

I also want to dispel the myths and distortions that ruin our perception of the past by asking a simple question - \u201cBut is this really the case?\u201d. I have a 2:1 Degree in History and a passion for early 20th Century conflicts (mainly WW2). I\u2019m therefore approaching this like I would an academic essay. Lots of sources, quotes, references and so on. Only the truth will do.\n\nThis video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature.

                    "description": "Lopatin's 62nd Army is crushed inside the Kalach Pocket as Paulus's 6th Army devours what's left of Soviet resistance in the cauldron (German: Kessel). But, while the German Generals proclaim a great victory, the reality was slightly different... Also Eremenko plans the defense of the city of Stalingrad, with thousands of civilians obliged by the State to dig many miles of anti-tank ditches and fortifications. Will these be enough to stall the Wehrmacht advance? Will the Red Army recover from it's defeat? Let's find out.\n\n(This was formerly S2/E6)\n\n\u2b50 The next video in this series: https://youtu.be/t71aD-nOkkk \u2b50\n\nIf you like Stalingrad, you may also enjoy historian Anton Joly's YouTube channel \"Stalingrad Battle Data\".

This move splits the Soviet 51st Army in two and forces the Soviets to improvise a southern defense of the region. As a result, Vasily Chuikov is given a new command - over the 64th Army's Southern Operational Group. Chuikov attempts to form a line as the chaos overwhelms the men of the 208th Rifle Division.\n\nThe script for this video was 4,461 words long.\n\n(This was formerly S2/E4)\n\n\u2b50 The next video in this series: https://youtu.be/1ayh2_1UZkU \u2b50\n\nBATTLESTORM STALINGRAD Series playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNSNgGzaledi9jQeOzCUtBP2pxYdCYiXX\n\nVideos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\n- - - - -\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY / SOURCES\n\nCheck out Jason D Mark's books!

Were the large losses this offensive posture incurred on Soviet soldiers worth the effect they had on the Wehrmacht? Did Stalin play a large role in influencing this strategy or was this something ingrained in the Soviet high command's mindset and operational doctrine? And would a defensive posture, specifically in 1941, have better suited the Red Army or was buying time the best option for the USSR?\n\nVideos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\n- - - - -\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY / SOURCES\n\nSpecific sources used -\n\nGlantz, D. & House, J. \u201cWhen Titan\u2019s Clashed.\u201d University Press of Kansas, 2015.\nFritz, S. \u201cOstkrieg: Hitler\u2019s War of Extermination in the East.\u201d University Press of Kentucky. 2011.\n(David Stahel's books would be relevant too, although I didn't use them in the video.)\n\nFull list of all my sources https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/114GiK85MPs0v4GKm0izPj3DL2CrlJUdAantx5GQUKn8/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- - - - -\n\nSUPPORT TIK\n\nWant to ask a question?

                    "description": "Thank you to Eric Zadravec for today's question! - Were the constant counter-attacks and counter-offensives conducted by the Red Army in 1941 and 1942 a deliberate strategy of attrition or merely the result of the Stavka overestimating the Red Army's abilities and a 'cult of the offensive' mindset? Were the large losses this offensive posture incurred on Soviet soldiers worth the effect they had on the Wehrmacht? Did Stalin play a large role in influencing this strategy or was this something ingrained in the Soviet high command's mindset and operational doctrine? And would a defensive posture, specifically in 1941, have better suited the Red Army or was buying time the best option for the USSR?\n\nVideos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\n- - - - -\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY / SOURCES\n\nSpecific sources used -\n\nGlantz, D. & House, J. \u201cWhen Titan\u2019s Clashed.\u201d University Press of Kansas, 2015.\nFritz, S. \u201cOstkrieg: Hitler\u2019s War of Extermination in the East.\u201d University Press of Kentucky. 2011.\n(David Stahel's books would be relevant too, although I didn't use them in the video.)\n\nFull list of all my sources https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/114GiK85MPs0v4GKm0izPj3DL2CrlJUdAantx5GQUKn8/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- - - - -\n\nSUPPORT TIK\n\nWant to ask a question?

                "description": "The Battle of Stalingrad was the largest land battle in World War II. It was also the longest - an epic seven month campaign lasting from the 21st of July 1942 to the 2nd of February 1943. The fighting for the city has become infamous for its intensity, yet many have forgotten that the battle started outside of the city in July 1942 as Fall Blau (Case Blue) was reaching its zenith. By the 25th of July 1942, Paulus's 6th Army had broken through the 62nd Army's lines and had reached the Don Bend near Kalach. Under Stalin's watchful eye, Moskalenko's 1st Tank Army and Kriuchenkin\u2019s 4th Tank Army were ordered to mount a counterattack in order to destroy Wietersheim\u2019s 14th Panzer Corps. Will the Soviet tank armies be able to complete this task? Let's find out.\n\n(This was formerly S1/E2)\n\nThe script for this video was 5,363 words.\n\n\u2b50 The next video in this series: https://youtu.be/n1DeU6NckLM \u2b50\n\nVideos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe first Season of this series will be three episodes (including this one), with the final video scheduled to release on the 4th of November 2019.

It was also the longest - an epic seven month campaign lasting from the 21st of July 1942 to the 2nd of February 1943. The fighting for the city has become infamous for its intensity, yet many have forgotten that the battle started outside of the city in July 1942 as Fall Blau (Case Blue) was reaching its zenith. By the 25th of July 1942, Paulus's 6th Army had broken through the 62nd Army's lines and had reached the Don Bend near Kalach. Under Stalin's watchful eye, Moskalenko's 1st Tank Army and Kriuchenkin\u2019s 4th Tank Army were ordered to mount a counterattack in order to destroy Wietersheim\u2019s 14th Panzer Corps. Will the Soviet tank armies be able to complete this task? Let's find out.\n\n(This was formerly S1/E2)\n\nThe script for this video was 5,363 words.\n\n\u2b50 The next video in this series: https://youtu.be/n1DeU6NckLM \u2b50\n\nVideos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe first Season of this series will be three episodes (including this one), with the final video scheduled to release on the 4th of November 2019.

                    "description": "The Battle of Stalingrad was the largest land battle in World War II. It was also the longest - an epic seven month campaign lasting from the 21st of July 1942 to the 2nd of February 1943. The fighting for the city has become infamous for its intensity, yet many have forgotten that the battle started outside of the city in July 1942 as Fall Blau (Case Blue) was reaching its zenith. The German 6th Army, commanded by Paulus, crashed into Red Army forces defending at the Great Bend of the Don River. From this moment onwards, both sides were in almost continuous battle until the bitter end. In this series, we will explore the battle from start to finish, going into more detail than any documentary on the subject has ever done before.

The second question is a huge question which I'm not possibly going to be able to cover fully in one video, but I thought I'd give some thoughts on it today. I am sympathetic to the Polish cause, and think Stalin was evil, but that doesn't mean that the Home Army and the Government-in-Exile didn't drop the ball on this one.\n\nWant to ask a question?

                "description": "This video is a historical documentary about the WW2 battle of Operation Crusader of 1941, specifically the events of 23rd November 1941 - which is Totensonntag. The word \"Totensonntag\" (German for: \"Dead Sunday\") is the name given to the day which is covered in this episode. It is not about \"dead\" people or anything else, it is about the North African Campaign of WW2. While the name may have the word \"dead\" in it, and the thumbnail has a skull in it, all this can be safely ignored as no skulls or dead things are shown in the video. It is also not clickbait, since this is 100% relevant to the video (the day impacted the fighting morale of the German troops, and the fighting on this day led to several battle units getting destroyed - but again, the units fade off the map in the video, nothing bad is shown).

                    "description": "This video is a historical documentary about the WW2 battle of Operation Crusader of 1941, specifically the events of 23rd November 1941 - which is Totensonntag. The word \"Totensonntag\" (German for: \"Dead Sunday\") is the name given to the day which is covered in this episode. It is not about \"dead\" people or anything else, it is about the North African Campaign of WW2. While the name may have the word \"dead\" in it, and the thumbnail has a skull in it, all this can be safely ignored as no skulls or dead things are shown in the video. It is also not clickbait, since this is 100% relevant to the video (the day impacted the fighting morale of the German troops, and the fighting on this day led to several battle units getting destroyed - but again, the units fade off the map in the video, nothing bad is shown).

This left the Italian Ariete Division alone to stop the Eighth Army at the First Battle of Bir el Gubi.\n\nThis is BATTLESTORM Operation Crusader Part 6.

                "description": "Turns out the German tactical advantage early in the war was due to a couple of simple reasons. And because they had an advantage in their tank (panzers) and their anti-tank guns, it meant that the Allies and the Soviets had a real problem early in the war. In North Africa, the British used out of date doctrines and inferior guns (like the 2-Pounder), while the Soviets had some good tanks (like the T-34), but sent them off on their own to get destroyed. Without a clear Combined Arms Doctrine, the Allies were simply at a disadvantage. But by the mid to late war, this changed, thanks mostly to the fact that the Allies and Comintern were finally able to mobilize. Yes, early German mobilization prior to WW2 is the key to this, as you will see in the video.\n\nThis video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature.

In North Africa, the British used out of date doctrines and inferior guns (like the 2-Pounder), while the Soviets had some good tanks (like the T-34), but sent them off on their own to get destroyed. Without a clear Combined Arms Doctrine, the Allies were simply at a disadvantage. But by the mid to late war, this changed, thanks mostly to the fact that the Allies and Comintern were finally able to mobilize. Yes, early German mobilization prior to WW2 is the key to this, as you will see in the video.\n\nThis video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature.

The film Enemy at the Gates is a typical example of this idea; showing the Soviets at the battle of Stalingrad to waste the lives of their men. But is this really the case? Well... no.\n\nYes, I said 1942 was the beginning of the war - I'm sorry about that. I keep talking about Stalingrad, and therefore I keep repeating 1942, 1942, 1942 to the point that it's become a habit. I then also didn't catch it in editing. So please forgive me for this error. The war began on the 22nd of June 1941.\n\nCheck out the pinned comment below for more information, notes, links, and sources.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe if you like history or gaming!

The film Enemy at the Gates is a typical example of this idea; showing the Soviets at the battle of Stalingrad to waste the lives of their men. But is this really the case? Well... no.\n\nYes, I said 1942 was the beginning of the war - I'm sorry about that. I keep talking about Stalingrad, and therefore I keep repeating 1942, 1942, 1942 to the point that it's become a habit. I then also didn't catch it in editing. So please forgive me for this error. The war began on the 22nd of June 1941.\n\nCheck out the pinned comment below for more information, notes, links, and sources.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe if you like history or gaming!

They were part of the 100th J\u00e4ger Division, itself the only j\u00e4ger division to fight at Stalingrad.

                    "description": "Looking for the most in-depth look at Operation Battleaxe? We cover the tank battle, the combat at the Hellfire Pass (Halfaya) the units of the Afrika Korps and the Desert Rats, and learn the roles and fate of the commanders on both sides during this epic battle. Battleaxe is an incredibly important battle that has massive tactical and strategic implications for both sides of World War II. Yet this is a battle unknown to many, and not very well documented. Today, we change that.\n \nUsing animations and detailed maps, let's find out what happened in one of the most crucial battles in the North African Campaign of World War II.\n \nCheck out my other Battlestorm Videos!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNSNgGzaledgHIszXQVDreX-ZC1Xejf9Y\n \nSubscribe if you like history or gaming!
