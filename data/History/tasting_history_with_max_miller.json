Heat the milk to 180\u00b0F then remove it from the heat and whisk in the butter. Let the mixture cool to 120\u00b0F.\n2. Activate the yeast by mixing it with 1/4 cup warm water and a pinch of sugar.\n3. Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together, then add the yeast, eggs, and milk/butter mixture. Form a dough and knead until smooth, adding flour when necessary to make it workable. It should still remain a sticky dough. Put the dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover, letting it rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size. Then punch down the dough and let it rise a second time. \n4. While the dough rises, heat the oil in a large frying pan and add the yellow onion. Cook for 10 minutes or until the onions are soft and translucent. Then add the ground beef and cook until browned, about 7 minutes. Add the cabbage and let it cook down for a couple minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients and cook for several minutes, tasting and adjusting spice as it cooks. Once cooked, set the filling aside to cool completely. \n5. Once the dough is fully risen, divide it into 15 equal pieces and form them into balls. Roll each ball out into a circle 6 inches in diameter. Place 1/3 cup of cooled filling into the center of each disk of dough and gather up the sides to form a parcel, pinching the dough together in the center. \n6. Set the bierocks on a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between each, then cover and let rise for 20 minutes. \n7. Once risen, bake the bierocks, 1 sheet at a time, in the oven at 350\u00b0F for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the tops begin to brown. Remove them from the oven and brush with melted butter. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n\n**Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Tasting History will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Heat the milk to 180\u00b0F then remove it from the heat and whisk in the butter. Let the mixture cool to 120\u00b0F.\n2. Activate the yeast by mixing it with 1/4 cup warm water and a pinch of sugar.\n3. Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together, then add the yeast, eggs, and milk/butter mixture. Form a dough and knead until smooth, adding flour when necessary to make it workable. It should still remain a sticky dough. Put the dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover, letting it rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size. Then punch down the dough and let it rise a second time. \n4. While the dough rises, heat the oil in a large frying pan and add the yellow onion. Cook for 10 minutes or until the onions are soft and translucent. Then add the ground beef and cook until browned, about 7 minutes. Add the cabbage and let it cook down for a couple minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients and cook for several minutes, tasting and adjusting spice as it cooks. Once cooked, set the filling aside to cool completely. \n5. Once the dough is fully risen, divide it into 15 equal pieces and form them into balls. Roll each ball out into a circle 6 inches in diameter. Place 1/3 cup of cooled filling into the center of each disk of dough and gather up the sides to form a parcel, pinching the dough together in the center. \n6. Set the bierocks on a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between each, then cover and let rise for 20 minutes. \n7. Once risen, bake the bierocks, 1 sheet at a time, in the oven at 350\u00b0F for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the tops begin to brown. Remove them from the oven and brush with melted butter. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n\n**Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Tasting History will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Heat the milk in a saucepan over low heat. Let it steam but do not bring it to a simmer. Add in half of the flour and mix until incorporated. Continue to add flour a little at a time until you have a very thick mixture that pulls away from the sides of the saucepan. You may not need all of the flour and you can add more milk if required. Cook for 10-15 minutes total, stirring the entire time. Then remove it from the heat and let it cool for 2 minutes.\n2. While still quite warm, dump the mixture onto a plate and spread it out to cover the plate with a uniform thickness. Smooth the top. Let cool completely (you can put it in the refrigerator to chill faster and make it easier to cut).\n3. Once cooled, slice the mixture into small, bite sized pieces of any shape. \n4. Heat the olive oil in a deep pan until it reaches 350\u00b0F/175\u00b0C. Then add 6-8 pieces of dough in at a time. Let them fry for 1 minute, then use a spoon to break them up and continue to fry for another minute and a half or until they're golden brown. Remove them and let them drain while you continue to fry the rest of the dough. \n5. Once they are all fried, toss them in a bowl with some warm honey and coat them well. Sprinkle with pepper and serve.\n\nSubtitles: Jose Mendoza | IG @worldagainstjose\n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nApicius: By Bonho1962 - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=5626800\nLife Giving Spring: By \u03a7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 Templar52 - Transferred from el.wikipedia to Commons by Alaniaris using CommonsHelper.(Original text: \u03a6\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b5\u03be \u03b9\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd), Attribution, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4331192\nJustinian: By Petar Milo\u0161evi\u0107 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=40035957\nPastrami: By Stilfehler - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6730845\nGarum Factory: By Anual - Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7521483\n\n#tastinghistory #byzantine #constantinople",

Work the butter into the flour with your finger tips, then add the sugar and bloomed yeast. Finally add the milk, but only enough to make a sticky but workable dough. Knead for 15 minutes or until you have a smooth, sticky dough, then place the dough in a bowl and cover. Let it rest for 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size. \n\n3. Knock the air out of the risen dough and divide it into 24 pieces. Form the dough into balls then set on parchment and cover to let rise for 20 minutes. \n\n4.

Either mince, or mix in a food processor, the pork, chicken, parmesan, ricotta, herbs, and the spices (minus the sweet spice mixture). Mix until you have a paste. Set aside and make the pasta dough.\n\n2. Put the flour on the countertop and create a well in the middle. Crack the eggs into the well and, using your hands, mix the eggs together. Then, just a little at a time, start incorporating the flour. Keep working it in until you have a paste come together. Then knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it\u2019s nice and smooth. Set it aside and cover it with a bowl to rest for at least 20 minutes. \n\n3. Once rested, take about a 5th of it and roll it out on a lightly floured surface. This can be done with a rolling pin or pasta roller. Either way, roll it out, then fold it in thirds like a letter, and roll it again. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then begin to roll it out as thinly as possible. \n\n4. Lay the strip of pasta out on a floured surface making sure not to get any flour on the topside. Then spoon about a teaspoon of filling in a row down the center of the pasta leaving about an inch and a half between them. Fold the pasta over the filling and gently press around each one to seal in the filling. Then cut out the ravioli making sure they\u2019re well sealed and set them on a dish. Repeat with the next piece of pasta dough. Don't attempt to roll out all of the pasta at once or it will dry out and become hard to shape the ravioli. \n\n5. Once the ravioli are formed, boil the chicken broth with the saffron for 5 minutes, then add 4-6 ravioli at a time and boil for about 4 minutes or until the pasta is to your liking. Place on a dish and top with parmesan and sprinkle with the sweet spice mixture. \n\n**Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Tasting History will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Either mince, or mix in a food processor, the pork, chicken, parmesan, ricotta, herbs, and the spices (minus the sweet spice mixture). Mix until you have a paste. Set aside and make the pasta dough.\n\n2. Put the flour on the countertop and create a well in the middle. Crack the eggs into the well and, using your hands, mix the eggs together. Then, just a little at a time, start incorporating the flour. Keep working it in until you have a paste come together. Then knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it\u2019s nice and smooth. Set it aside and cover it with a bowl to rest for at least 20 minutes. \n\n3. Once rested, take about a 5th of it and roll it out on a lightly floured surface. This can be done with a rolling pin or pasta roller. Either way, roll it out, then fold it in thirds like a letter, and roll it again. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then begin to roll it out as thinly as possible. \n\n4. Lay the strip of pasta out on a floured surface making sure not to get any flour on the topside. Then spoon about a teaspoon of filling in a row down the center of the pasta leaving about an inch and a half between them. Fold the pasta over the filling and gently press around each one to seal in the filling. Then cut out the ravioli making sure they\u2019re well sealed and set them on a dish. Repeat with the next piece of pasta dough. Don't attempt to roll out all of the pasta at once or it will dry out and become hard to shape the ravioli. \n\n5. Once the ravioli are formed, boil the chicken broth with the saffron for 5 minutes, then add 4-6 ravioli at a time and boil for about 4 minutes or until the pasta is to your liking. Place on a dish and top with parmesan and sprinkle with the sweet spice mixture. \n\n**Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Tasting History will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Preheat the oven to 215\u00b0F/100\u00b0C.\n2. Whisk the flours together with the baking powder, salt, sugar and golden syrup. Adding a little at a time, mix in the whole milk. You may not need the full quart, but as you mix, the rye will soak up a lot, so make sure you add enough to get the consistency of a cake batter.\n3. Pour the batter into a well greased dutch oven or other container that you can seal (it does not need to be airtight, but a good seal is needed to keep in the steam.\n4. Bake for 14 - 24 hours. Do not leave the oven unattended over night. Once baked, remove the bread from the oven, turn it out, and slice while hot. Serve with butter. \n\n**Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Tasting History will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

First work the butter with your hand to a cream, then beat in your sugar a quarter of an hour, beat the whites of your eggs to a very strong froth, mix them with your sugar and butter, beat your yolks half an hour at least, and mix them with your cake, then put in your flour, mace, and nutmeg, keep beating it well till your oven is ready, put in your brandy, and beat your currants and almonds lightly in, tie three sheets of paper round the bottom of your hoop to keep it from running out, rub it well with butter, put in your cake, and lay your sweetmeats in three lays, with cake betwixt every lay, after it is risen and coloured, cover it with paper before your oven is stopped up; it will take three hours baking. \n\nTo make Almond-Icing for the Bride Cake.\nBeat the whites of three eggs to a strong froth, beat a pound of Jordan almonds very fine with rose-water, mix your almonds with the eggs lightly together, a pound of common loaf sugar beat fine and put in by degrees; when your cake is enough, take it out, and lay your icing on, then put it in to brown. \n\nTo make Sugar Icing for the Bride Cake.\nBeat two pounds of double refined sugar, with two ounces of fine starch, sift it through a gauze sieve, then beat the whites of five eggs with a knife upon a pewter dish half an hour; beat in your sugar a little at a time, or it will make the eggs fall, and will not be so good a colour, when you have put in all your sugar, beat it half an hour longer, then lay it on your almond iceing, and spread it even with a knife; if it be put on as soon as the cake comes out of the oven it will be hard by the time the cake is cold. \n\nLINKS TO INGREDIENTS & EQUIPMENT**\nSony Alpha 7C Camera: https://amzn.to/2MQbNTK\nSigma 24-70mm f/2.8 Lens: https://amzn.to/35tjyoW\nKitchenAid 6 Qt Stand Mixer: https://amzn.to/3F2V4Da\nKitchenAid Hand Mixer: https://amzn.to/2XZJw2J\n\nLINKS TO SOURCES**\nWedding Cakes and Cultural History by Simon Charsley: https://amzn.to/3odkHeJ\nThe Experienced English Housekeeper by Elizabeth Raffald: https://amzn.to/2Wm4acJ\n\n**Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Tasting History will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Then fold them into the yolk and cream mixture until there are no streaks.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the ginger, long pepper and sandalwood. Then turn it out onto a piece of parchment and roll out to desired thickness. Cover and let cool for several hours or overnight.\n3. Once cool, sprinkle sugar on top and cut into whatever shape you like. Garnish with whole cloves (removing them before eating; they will add flavor) and gold. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nThe manor in Bondaroy: By FlyAkwa - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=21453106\nSoft Gingerbread: By Johan Bryggare - Mjuk pepparkaka med lingon, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9056046\nTorun Gingerbread: By Marcin Floryan - Own work, CC BY 2.5, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1300867\nFairings: By Foodista - originally posted to Flickr as Photo of Cornish Fairings (spiced Biscuits), CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6350943\nSpringerle after drying: CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1471467\nSpringerle Moldel au Schwaben: Von Andreas Bauerle - Eigenes Werk, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1471478\nGingerbread mold 1 & 2: Piotr Kuczy\u0144ski, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons \nThe Land of Cockaigne Map: https://wellcomecollection.org/works/fby24d44\n\n#tastinghistory #gingerbread #christmas"

Turn heat to medium and fry two to three balls at a time, turning every 10 to 15 seconds with tongs. At 60 seconds, begin to check the color; once they are a golden brown (60-90 seconds) take them out and set them on a wire rack over paper towels to drain. Repeat until all of the globi are fried. \n3. Dip the dried globi in honey (heating the honey can help if it is too thick). Then sprinkle with poppy seeds and serve.  \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nSaturn: By inconnu - User:Jean-Pol GRANDMONT (2011), CC BY 3.0, https://bit.ly/39OKgLF\nA Statue of Chronos: By Rufus46 - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://bit.ly/3giv9eH\nPileus: By Marie-Lan Nguyen (2009), CC BY 2.5, https://bit.ly/3osYo1l\nRoman Collared Slaves: Ashmolean Museum, CC BY-SA 2.0 https://bit.ly/36OoIgz\nCandles Oberflacht: Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://bit.ly/2Lf9yZp\nRoman Figurines: Carole Raddato from FRANKFURT, Germany, CC BY-SA 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0\n\n#tastinghistory #saturnalia #globi #romancooking",

Wash the corn and then add to a pot of boiling water with the calcium hydroxide. Boil for 30 - 45 minutes or until the skins easy come away from the corn. Remove from the heat and allow to sit in the water 8-12 hours. Rinse and soak your corn husks in water during this time. \n2. Strain the corn into a colander and rinse any residual calcium hydroxide off. Then, add the corn to a bowl of clean water and rub the skins off the corn. Repeat this process several times until the majority of the skins are off. Then grind the corn into masa. \n4. Add the tequesquite water to the masa until it forms a paste. Then spread a thin layer onto a corn husk. Add any filling. Then wrap the filling with the masa by folding the corn husk over it. Then fold down the end of the husk and tie closed. \n5. Add an inch of water to the bottom of the steamer and set two coins at the bottom (the sound of these will let you know if you need to add water during the steaming). Then set the steamer basket in and lay a bed of corn husks on the bottom. Add the tamales and cover with another layer of husks. Then place the lid on the pot and set the water to boiling. Steam for 1 hour. The tamales are done with they easy pull away from the husk. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nMetate and Mano - By Leoboudv - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://bit.ly/3mETDkT\n\n#tastinghistory #tamales #aztec",

Wash the corn and then add to a pot of boiling water with the calcium hydroxide. Boil for 30 - 45 minutes or until the skins easy come away from the corn. Remove from the heat and allow to sit in the water 8-12 hours. Rinse and soak your corn husks in water during this time. \n2. Strain the corn into a colander and rinse any residual calcium hydroxide off. Then, add the corn to a bowl of clean water and rub the skins off the corn. Repeat this process several times until the majority of the skins are off. Then grind the corn into masa. \n4. Add the tequesquite water to the masa until it forms a paste. Then spread a thin layer onto a corn husk. Add any filling. Then wrap the filling with the masa by folding the corn husk over it. Then fold down the end of the husk and tie closed. \n5. Add an inch of water to the bottom of the steamer and set two coins at the bottom (the sound of these will let you know if you need to add water during the steaming). Then set the steamer basket in and lay a bed of corn husks on the bottom. Add the tamales and cover with another layer of husks. Then place the lid on the pot and set the water to boiling. Steam for 1 hour. The tamales are done with they easy pull away from the husk. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nMetate and Mano - By Leoboudv - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://bit.ly/3mETDkT\n\n#tastinghistory #tamales #aztec"

Mix and beat these ingredients well together, tie them tightly in a thickly floured cloth, and boil them for three hours and a half. We can recommend this as a remarkably light small rich pudding: it may be served with German, wine, or punch sauce. \n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 3 oz (85g) Flour\n- 3 oz (85g) Bread Crumbs\n- 6 oz (170g) Beef Suet (Lard or Crisco will work as well)\n- 6 oz (170g) stoned Raisins \n- 6 oz (170g) Currants\n- 4 oz (113g) Minced Apples\n- 5 oz (142g) Brown Sugar\n- 2 oz (57g) Candied Peel\n- \u00bd teaspoon Nutmeg and mace\n- A few grains of Salt\n- 3 oz  (88ml) Brandy\n- 3 Eggs\n\nMETHOD\n1. Boil the pudding cloth for 20 minutes. Then carefully remove it from the pot and lay it out flat. Spread suet, lard or butter across it and rub in a liberal amount of flour. \n2. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mix. Then form into a ball and place in the middle of the pudding cloth. Gathering the cloth tightly around it, twist the cloth at the 'neck' then wrap it with a string several times and tie tightly around it. \n3. Boil a large pot of water with an upside down plate on the bottom of the pot. Set the pudding in the boiling water and let boil for 3 1/2 hours. Check often and add more boiling water when necessary.\n4. Remove pudding from the water and allow to dry before unwrapping. This can be served right away or aged for several weeks/months. \n\nPunch sauce for Sweet Puddings\nThis may be served with custard, plain bread, and plum-puddings. With two ounces of sugar and a quarter of a pint of water, boil very gently the rind of half a small lemon, and somewhat less of orange-peel, from fifteen to twenty minutes; strain out the rinds, thicken the sauce with an ounce and a half of butter and nearly a teaspoonful of flour, add a half-glass of brandy, the same of white wine, two thirds of a glass of rum, with the juice of half an orange, and rather less of lemon-juice: serve the sauce very hot, but do not allow it to boil after the spirit is stirred in. \n- 2oz Sugar\n- \u00bc pint Water\n- Lemon & Orange Rind\n- 1 \u00bd oz Butter\n- 1 Teaspoon Flour\n- \u00bd Wineglassful Brandy\n- \u00bd Wineglassful White Wine\n- \u2154 Wineglassful Rum\n- Orange & Lemon Juice\n\nMUSIC CREDITS\nWe Wish You a Merry Christmas by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nArtist: http://www.twinmusicom.org/\n\nAngels We Have Heard - Christmas by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?collection=004&page=1\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nRondo for harp - Mike Harper\n\n\n#tastinghistory #christmaspudding #figgypudding",

Granny Smith)\n- 3 Eggs beaten\n- 2 Handfuls of fresh herbs (I used Rosemary, Parsley, and Thyme) \n- 6 Tablespoons (85g) Salted Butter\n- 1/3 Cup (50g) Raisins\n- 1/3 Cup (50g) Currants\n- 1/2 Cup (100g) Sugar\n- 1/4 Cup (60ml) Sherry or Sack\n- Lard or Vegetable Oil for frying (optional)\n- 1 Nine-Inch Pie Crust\n\nMETHOD\n1. Set the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) and line a pie dish with your pie dough.\n2. Peel the pumpkin, then remove the stem and seeds, and quarter it. Slice each piece into thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat this process with the apples. \n3. Put 2 tablespoons of the butter into a frying pan and set over medium heat. Note that, depending on the amount of pumpkin you fry, you may require more butter; you can also use lard or vegetable oil. Then mix the herbs into the beaten eggs and dip the pumpkin slices into the egg, coating them lightly. Then place them into the frying pan and fry for 10 minutes, or until the pumpkin is quite soft. Depending on the size of your pumpkin, you may need to do this in several batches. The pumpkin should not be more than 3 layers thick in the pan.\n4. While the pumpkin fries, line the bottom of your pie crust with the apples. Once the pumpkin is cooked, place it in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of the butter, along with the raisins, currants, sugar, and the sherry or sack. Mix everything together and pour over the apples, smoothing the top. Bake for 20 minutes at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C), then reduce heat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and bake 40-50 minutes longer, or until the top of the pie is bubbling. Remove from the oven and set a on a wire rack. Scatter the 2 remaining tablespoons of butter on the top of the pie and allow to melt in. Cool completely before slicing. \n\nSend mail to:\nTasting History\n22647 Ventura Blvd, Suite 323\nLos Angeles, CA 91364\n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nPumpkin Bowl: https://bit.ly/2TPKh90\n\n#tastinghistory",

(Optional)\n- 1 Egg for Egg Wash (Optional)\n\nMETHOD\n1. Create an \"ale barm\" by mixing the yeast with the lukewarm ale and letting sit for 10 minutes. If you are using saffron, mix that into the sherry and let steep. \n2. In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt, nutmeg, clove, and mace together. Add the yeasted ale and work it in. Then work in the softened butter and the sack with saffron along with any fruit you are using. Mix until everything the dough comes together, then knead for 5 - 12 minutes. The longer you knead, the more bread-like the cakes will be, but the more they will rise.\n3. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour (it will likely not double in size), then punch the dough down and form into small cakes. Cover and allow the cakes to rise for another 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C.\n4. When the cakes have puffed up, add the optional egg wash and/or additional fruit, or form a cross on the top of each cake using the back of a knife (do not cut the cross in). Then back fro 20 minutes. When baked, allow to cool before serving. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nElinor Fettiplace Kneeling at her Father\u2019s Tomb: By Philip Halling, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=13460881\nAppleton Manor: By Des Blenkinsopp, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27990190\nAltar de D\u00eda de Muertos en Actopan, Hidalgo, M\u00e9xico \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Altar_de_D%C3%ADa_de_Muertos_en_Actopan%2C_Hidalgo%2C_M%C3%A9xico_%282017%29._37.jpg\nRubeHM / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\nNewgrange - TJP Finn https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange#/media/File:Irelands_history.jpg\nHalloween Costumes 1918 - Richard via Flickr\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/rich701/5805924287/in/photostream/\nCliffs of Dover: Immanuel Giel - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Cliffs_of_Dover#/media/File:White_Cliffs_of_Dover_02.JPG\nBonfire Night: Peter Trimming - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lewes_Guy_Fawkes_Night_Celebrations_(5)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1570214.jpg\n\n#tastinghistory #halloween #soulcakes",

(Optional)\n- 1 Egg for Egg Wash (Optional)\n\nMETHOD\n1. Create an \"ale barm\" by mixing the yeast with the lukewarm ale and letting sit for 10 minutes. If you are using saffron, mix that into the sherry and let steep. \n2. In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt, nutmeg, clove, and mace together. Add the yeasted ale and work it in. Then work in the softened butter and the sack with saffron along with any fruit you are using. Mix until everything the dough comes together, then knead for 5 - 12 minutes. The longer you knead, the more bread-like the cakes will be, but the more they will rise.\n3. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour (it will likely not double in size), then punch the dough down and form into small cakes. Cover and allow the cakes to rise for another 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C.\n4. When the cakes have puffed up, add the optional egg wash and/or additional fruit, or form a cross on the top of each cake using the back of a knife (do not cut the cross in). Then back fro 20 minutes. When baked, allow to cool before serving. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nElinor Fettiplace Kneeling at her Father\u2019s Tomb: By Philip Halling, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=13460881\nAppleton Manor: By Des Blenkinsopp, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27990190\nAltar de D\u00eda de Muertos en Actopan, Hidalgo, M\u00e9xico \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Altar_de_D%C3%ADa_de_Muertos_en_Actopan%2C_Hidalgo%2C_M%C3%A9xico_%282017%29._37.jpg\nRubeHM / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\nNewgrange - TJP Finn https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange#/media/File:Irelands_history.jpg\nHalloween Costumes 1918 - Richard via Flickr\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/rich701/5805924287/in/photostream/\nCliffs of Dover: Immanuel Giel - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Cliffs_of_Dover#/media/File:White_Cliffs_of_Dover_02.JPG\nBonfire Night: Peter Trimming - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lewes_Guy_Fawkes_Night_Celebrations_(5)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1570214.jpg\n\n#tastinghistory #halloween #soulcakes"

Charles Perry\nThe way to make it is to take equal parts sugar, almonds or pistachios, honey and sesame oil. Pound the sugar and almonds and mix them together. Take enough saffron to color it and add it with rose-water. Then throw the sesame oil in the dist so that it boils and boils up. Put the honey on it and stir it until foam appears, and throw the sugar and almonds on the honey. Stir continuously on a quiet fire until it is nearly thickened, and take it up. \n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 1 \u2153 cup (225g) Sugar\n- 2 cups (225g) Pistachios or Almonds \n- \u2154 cup (225g) Honey\n- 1 cup (225g) Sesame Oil\n- A pinch (10-15 threads) of saffron ground \n- 3 Tablespoons Rosewater\n\nMETHOD\n1. Grind the nuts into a powder then mix with the sugar. Add the saffron and rosewater and mix. \n2. Set a large saucepan over medium heat and add the sesame oil. Once hot, lower the burner to low and stir in the honey. Allow it to heat for several minutes until a light layer of foam covers the top. Then add the nut and sugar mixture and stir in.\n3. Stirring continuously, raise the heat to medium and let the candy cook until it starts to thicken; about 270\u00b0F/132\u00b0C. (Do not let it rise above 290\u00b0F/143\u00b0C or it will burn).\n4. Remove the pot from the heat and, working quickly, either set dollops of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment or aluminum foil OR spread the full mixture onto the baking sheet. The latter will then be broken up like peanut brittle rather than being individual candies. \n5. Allow to cool then serve. The candy will become very sticky at room temperature and will lose its sheen, so keep it in the refrigerator to minimize this. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nSugar Cane Plantation: By Mariordo - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://bit.ly/3cuOCqY\nSugar Cane Field: Phil / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)\n\n#tastinghistory #candy #sugar #history",

Charles Perry\nThe way to make it is to take equal parts sugar, almonds or pistachios, honey and sesame oil. Pound the sugar and almonds and mix them together. Take enough saffron to color it and add it with rose-water. Then throw the sesame oil in the dist so that it boils and boils up. Put the honey on it and stir it until foam appears, and throw the sugar and almonds on the honey. Stir continuously on a quiet fire until it is nearly thickened, and take it up. \n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 1 \u2153 cup (225g) Sugar\n- 2 cups (225g) Pistachios or Almonds \n- \u2154 cup (225g) Honey\n- 1 cup (225g) Sesame Oil\n- A pinch (10-15 threads) of saffron ground \n- 3 Tablespoons Rosewater\n\nMETHOD\n1. Grind the nuts into a powder then mix with the sugar. Add the saffron and rosewater and mix. \n2. Set a large saucepan over medium heat and add the sesame oil. Once hot, lower the burner to low and stir in the honey. Allow it to heat for several minutes until a light layer of foam covers the top. Then add the nut and sugar mixture and stir in.\n3. Stirring continuously, raise the heat to medium and let the candy cook until it starts to thicken; about 270\u00b0F/132\u00b0C. (Do not let it rise above 290\u00b0F/143\u00b0C or it will burn).\n4. Remove the pot from the heat and, working quickly, either set dollops of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment or aluminum foil OR spread the full mixture onto the baking sheet. The latter will then be broken up like peanut brittle rather than being individual candies. \n5. Allow to cool then serve. The candy will become very sticky at room temperature and will lose its sheen, so keep it in the refrigerator to minimize this. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nSugar Cane Plantation: By Mariordo - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://bit.ly/3cuOCqY\nSugar Cane Field: Phil / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)\n\n#tastinghistory #candy #sugar #history"

Then get two pounds of fresh ricotta, a pound and a half of grated Parmesan cheese, six ounces of a fat cheese, six ounces of fresh butter, half an ounce of pepper, three-quarters of an ounce of cinnamon, a quarter-ounce of cloves, six fresh eggs, beaten, and six ounces of sugar; with all those things make up a filling. Have a tourte pan ready, lined with a sheet of royal dough and with its flaky-pastry twist around it. Put the filling into it and cover it with a rippled sheet of pastry. Bake it in an oven or braise it. Serve it hot. It is optional whether you make it deep or shallow. \n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- Chard\n- Spinach\n- Mint \n- Marjoram \n- 1 lb (450g) Ricotta\n- \u00be lb (340g) Parmesan\n- 3oz (85g) of High Fat Cheese \n- 6 Tablespoons (85g) Butter Softened \n- 1 Tablespoons Pepper\n- 4 \u00bd Teaspoons Cinnamon\n- 1 \u00bd Teaspoons Cloves\n- 3 Medium Eggs\n- \u00bd Cup Sugar\n- 2 Portions of Flaky Pastry Dough\n\nMETHOD\n1. Line a large pie tin or cake pan with pastry dough and blind bake it in a 450\u00b0F/230\u00b0C oven for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked. Remove from the oven and let cool. \n2. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C. \n3. Finely Chop all of your herbs/greens.\n4. Mix the cheeses in a large bowl until somewhat smooth. Add the eggs and beat until incorporated. Then add the butter, sugar, and spices and mix until combined. Finally, add in the greens and mix them by hand so as not to bruise the greens. \n5. Once the filling is well mixed, pour into the cooled pastry shell and smooth the top. Then top it with the other piece of pastry and press the edges into the bottom dough. Leave some ripples on the top crust to give room for the filling to expand during baking. Brush the top with an egg wash, then set on the bottom rack of the oven and bake for 1 hour.  \n6. Once baked remove from the oven and serve warm.\n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nPages from Scappi\u2019s Opera - The Wellcome Library:  https://bit.ly/3mLPRGF\nTurkey and cockerel etching - The Wellcome Library: https://bit.ly/3hUXGpX\nRoast Duck - Image by RitaE from Pixabay: https://bit.ly/363Hd0f\nHedgehog - The Wellcome Library: https://bit.ly/3j01BD9\nIron - By Alchemist-hp (talk) (www.pse-mendelejew.de): https://bit.ly/2RTp6lA\nHorseshoe - By Fonzy, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://bit.ly/3cxklrl \n\n#tastinghistory #scappi #herbpie",

With clean hands, roll it nicely long and rounded and make little pretzels. Place in a warm oven and bake, not burning it but until well dried so they are crisp and good. You may or may not use cinnamon. And it is called Precedella. \n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 2 1/2 Cups (300g) flour\n- 4-5 large egg yolks\n- \u2153 Cup (80 ml) White Wine \n- \u00be Cup (150g) Sugar\n- \u00bd tsp ground aniseed\n- \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon (optional)\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n\nMETHOD\n1. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C).\n2. Whisk together the flour, aniseed, cinnamon and sugar.\n3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar until smooth and pale. Then add the wine and mix until incorporated. Then, add in the dry ingredients 1/3rd at a time, mixing gently until there are no streaks. Be sure to not over mix or the pretzel will become tough. \n4. Divide the dough into 5-6 pieces and roll each piece into a long rope. (If the dough is too sticky to handle, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until workable) Then form each rope into a pretzel and place on a lined baking sheet. Bake 12-15 minutes or until dry and crisp. \n*Optional: Add an egg wash before baking to give the precedella a nice sheen. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS:\nQueen Therese of Bavaria: https://bit.ly/3meQBUy\nBeer Hall: holzijue via Pixabay https://bit.ly/2ZF8thU\nLaugenbrezeln: Bild von Sebastian Ganso via Pixabay: https://pixabay.com/de/photos/brezel-laugenbrezel-2630418/\nGallic Fields: 0 A.D.

With clean hands, roll it nicely long and rounded and make little pretzels. Place in a warm oven and bake, not burning it but until well dried so they are crisp and good. You may or may not use cinnamon. And it is called Precedella. \n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 2 1/2 Cups (300g) flour\n- 4-5 large egg yolks\n- \u2153 Cup (80 ml) White Wine \n- \u00be Cup (150g) Sugar\n- \u00bd tsp ground aniseed\n- \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon (optional)\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n\nMETHOD\n1. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C).\n2. Whisk together the flour, aniseed, cinnamon and sugar.\n3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar until smooth and pale. Then add the wine and mix until incorporated. Then, add in the dry ingredients 1/3rd at a time, mixing gently until there are no streaks. Be sure to not over mix or the pretzel will become tough. \n4. Divide the dough into 5-6 pieces and roll each piece into a long rope. (If the dough is too sticky to handle, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until workable) Then form each rope into a pretzel and place on a lined baking sheet. Bake 12-15 minutes or until dry and crisp. \n*Optional: Add an egg wash before baking to give the precedella a nice sheen. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS:\nQueen Therese of Bavaria: https://bit.ly/3meQBUy\nBeer Hall: holzijue via Pixabay https://bit.ly/2ZF8thU\nLaugenbrezeln: Bild von Sebastian Ganso via Pixabay: https://pixabay.com/de/photos/brezel-laugenbrezel-2630418/\nGallic Fields: 0 A.D.

The filling comprises the flesh of walnuts and white sugar. Water is sprinkled on the filling and the balls are rolled around in flour to form them. They are as big as walnuts. This is the same as what the people of the Jiangnan region call Tangyuan. \u201d\n\n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n-1 1/4 Cups (140g) Walnuts \n- \u00bd Cup (100g) Sugar\n- 4 Tablespoons (57g) Melted Lard or Melted Butter\n- 4 Cups (450g) Glutinous Rice Flour\n- Water\n\nMETHOD\n1. Toast the walnuts (optional) in a pan over medium heat and let them cool. Then crush them fine, almost to a powder. \n2. Mix the crushed walnuts, sugar, and lard/butter and mix until combined. Chill in the refrigerator for an hour or until it is cool.\n3. Take the mixture and form it into small balls; about a dozen. \n4. Take two large bowls, one filled with water and one with glutinous rice flour. Roll the balls in the glutinous rice flour until covered, then place them in a mesh sieve and dip them in the water. (You can also set them in the water and remove them with a slotted spoon). Then return them to the flour and roll again. Repeat this process 7-10 times, or until no filling can be seen.\n5. Boil a large pot of water. Set the balls in the water and boil for 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the top. Note that the balls will expand, so leave plenty of room in the pot. Once the balls have floated to the top, pour a cup of cold water into the pot. This will stop the boiling and allow a skin to form on the balls. Allow the water to reheat to boiling and wait until the balls float again. Then remove and serve immediately. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nThe Lantern Festival 2012: North Sea Dreamer https://bit.ly/3bD1OJI\nSesame Seeds: https://bit.ly/3m61pEk\nMing Uniformed Guard: Mingdynastyavenger https://bit.ly/2RnRcoZ \nMUSIC CREDITS\nWuxia2_Guzheng_Pipa by PeriTune | http://peritune.com\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nAttribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nFolk Chinese by PeriTune | http://peritune.com\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nCreative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US\n\n#tastinghistory #yuanxiao #tangyuan",

The filling comprises the flesh of walnuts and white sugar. Water is sprinkled on the filling and the balls are rolled around in flour to form them. They are as big as walnuts. This is the same as what the people of the Jiangnan region call Tangyuan. \u201d\n\n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n-1 1/4 Cups (140g) Walnuts \n- \u00bd Cup (100g) Sugar\n- 4 Tablespoons (57g) Melted Lard or Melted Butter\n- 4 Cups (450g) Glutinous Rice Flour\n- Water\n\nMETHOD\n1. Toast the walnuts (optional) in a pan over medium heat and let them cool. Then crush them fine, almost to a powder. \n2. Mix the crushed walnuts, sugar, and lard/butter and mix until combined. Chill in the refrigerator for an hour or until it is cool.\n3. Take the mixture and form it into small balls; about a dozen. \n4. Take two large bowls, one filled with water and one with glutinous rice flour. Roll the balls in the glutinous rice flour until covered, then place them in a mesh sieve and dip them in the water. (You can also set them in the water and remove them with a slotted spoon). Then return them to the flour and roll again. Repeat this process 7-10 times, or until no filling can be seen.\n5. Boil a large pot of water. Set the balls in the water and boil for 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the top. Note that the balls will expand, so leave plenty of room in the pot. Once the balls have floated to the top, pour a cup of cold water into the pot. This will stop the boiling and allow a skin to form on the balls. Allow the water to reheat to boiling and wait until the balls float again. Then remove and serve immediately. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nThe Lantern Festival 2012: North Sea Dreamer https://bit.ly/3bD1OJI\nSesame Seeds: https://bit.ly/3m61pEk\nMing Uniformed Guard: Mingdynastyavenger https://bit.ly/2RnRcoZ \nMUSIC CREDITS\nWuxia2_Guzheng_Pipa by PeriTune | http://peritune.com\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nAttribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nFolk Chinese by PeriTune | http://peritune.com\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nCreative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US\n\n#tastinghistory #yuanxiao #tangyuan"

Grind it and sift. Mix with the dough a little melted lard, salt, and little of the settled tequesquite so the dough is workable. Sprinkle with flour and form into a wheel, well flattened in the way you like, and put in the middle a little aged cheese, or fresh, according to the preference of each one. Fold over the edges so they stick. At this point put them into very hot lard, bathing continuously each so they puff up. Take them out and drain them and eat them fresh.  \n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 1 1/2 Cups (180g) Masa Harina\n- 1 Cup (250ml) Warm Water\n- 1 teaspoon Salt\n- 2 tablespoons of lard plus more for frying (or any oil of your choice)\n- 2 tablespoons Tequesquite water (Using a tablespoon of tequesquite and 4oz boiling water) \n- 4oz (115g) cheese \n\nMETHOD\n1. Mix the salt, masa harina, and water together to form a dough. Add in the 2 tablespoons of lard (or oil) and tequesquite water making sure to not get any large pieces of rock. \n2. Shape the dough into balls about the size of a golf ball and press into tortillas either by hand, with a rolling pin, or with a tortilla press. \n3. Place a sprinkling of cheese in the center of the tortilla then fold over and press down to seal in the cheese, forming a quesadilla. \n4. Heat lard or oil in a pan about a half inch deep over medium high heat. Place the quesadilla into hot lard or oil. After about 1 minute, flip the quesadilla over to cook the other size. Once the quesadilla has browned and puffed up a bit, remove from the oil and set on a paper towel to drain. Then eat.\n\nPHOTO CREDITS (Creative Commons Licenses)\nQuetzelcoatl: https://bit.ly/3bmZjeo\nTortillas on a Comal: https://bit.ly/2QOxC4A\nGirl with Pellagra: https://bit.ly/3bglNOh\nAztec Calendar: https://bit.ly/31OCKw3\nAnt with Corn: https://bit.ly/3lEJwwj\nSierra Madres: https://bit.ly/32LN9rD\n\n#tastinghistory #quesadillas #aztecs",

Assemble your powder douce by grinding all the spices into powder and mixing together. There will be plenty of powder douce left over for future recipes. \n2. To make the noodles, mix the flour and water together and knead as you would bread dough, about 15 minutes by hand. Then cover the dough and let it rest for 20 minutes. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out as thin as possible, about 1/16 of an inch thick if possible. Then slice your noodles however you'd like. For this version of the recipe, I made squares 3 fingers in width. Then let the pasta dry.\n3. Set the stock over medium heat and once it's at a rolling boil, add the dried noodles and boil for 8-12 minutes. The length depends on the thickness of the noodle and how well you'd like it done. Once boiled, empty the noodles and broth into a colander. \n4. Assemble the lasagna before the noodles cool. One layer of noodles, a light layer of grated cheese, a layer of powder douce to taste. Repeat 2 or 3 times depending on the size of your tray or bowl. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nVincisgrassi: Gastronomia Slow via flickr / CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)\nLasagna Bolognese: Sambawamba / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\nThe Plague In Florence in 1348: Wellcome Library / CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)\nTomatoes: Liz West via flickr / CC BY-SA 2.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\nTaleggio Cheese: By F.

Mix your herbs into the flour, then, on a clean surface, create a ring of flour.\n2. Dissolve the salt into the lukewarm water.\n3. Pour the Biga/Starter into the ring of flour and slowly work in the flour adding water as needed. Note that, depending on the flours you use and the liquid content of your starter, you may not need the full amount of water, so add it slowly. Stopped mixing once the dough comes together. \n4. Knead the dough until smooth (about 12-15 minutes). Then place it in a bowl, cover, and let rise approximately 2 hours or until the dough doubles in size. \n5. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F/205\u00b0C. Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knock the air out, and form it into a ball. Place the loaf on a baking sheet or bread cloche, cover, and allow to rise for 20 minutes. \n6. Once the loaf has puffed up, take a piece of baking string and tie it around the middle (the waist) of the loaf, cinching it and creating a bow. With another piece of string, make four intersecting lines across the top of the loaf creating 8 equal triangles. These marks should be fairly deep as they will lessen as the loaf bakes. Then, with your finger, poke a deep hole in the center of the loaf. \n7. Bake the loaf approximately 40 minutes. If you are using a cloche, remove the lid 30 minutes in to allow the loaf to darken. Once baked, remove the loaf and set on a wire rack to cool. \n\nPhoto Credits:\nPompeii Loaf: Beatrice / CC BY-SA 2.0 IT (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/it/deed.en)\nBarley: I, Dschwen / CC BY-SA (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\nRice: By \u00a9 2009 Jee & Rani Nature Photography (License: CC BY-SA 4.0), CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=30677472\nSpelt: Sten / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nSesame: Krish Dulal / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nPompeii Map: MapMaster / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nVilla San Marco: Mentnafunangann / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nRuins of Pompeii: ElfQrin / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\nPompeii Bakery: Wknight94 / CC BY-SA (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\nBakery of Popidius Priscus: Carole Raddato from FRANKFURT, Germany / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)\n\nMusic Credits:\nBlood Eagle by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nAttribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nPrelude Cello Suite 3\nExzel Music Publishing (freemusicpublicdomain.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n#tastinghistory #panisquadratus #romanbread #pompeiibread #ancientrome",

Mix your herbs into the flour, then, on a clean surface, create a ring of flour.\n2. Dissolve the salt into the lukewarm water.\n3. Pour the Biga/Starter into the ring of flour and slowly work in the flour adding water as needed. Note that, depending on the flours you use and the liquid content of your starter, you may not need the full amount of water, so add it slowly. Stopped mixing once the dough comes together. \n4. Knead the dough until smooth (about 12-15 minutes). Then place it in a bowl, cover, and let rise approximately 2 hours or until the dough doubles in size. \n5. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F/205\u00b0C. Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knock the air out, and form it into a ball. Place the loaf on a baking sheet or bread cloche, cover, and allow to rise for 20 minutes. \n6. Once the loaf has puffed up, take a piece of baking string and tie it around the middle (the waist) of the loaf, cinching it and creating a bow. With another piece of string, make four intersecting lines across the top of the loaf creating 8 equal triangles. These marks should be fairly deep as they will lessen as the loaf bakes. Then, with your finger, poke a deep hole in the center of the loaf. \n7. Bake the loaf approximately 40 minutes. If you are using a cloche, remove the lid 30 minutes in to allow the loaf to darken. Once baked, remove the loaf and set on a wire rack to cool. \n\nPhoto Credits:\nPompeii Loaf: Beatrice / CC BY-SA 2.0 IT (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/it/deed.en)\nBarley: I, Dschwen / CC BY-SA (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\nRice: By \u00a9 2009 Jee & Rani Nature Photography (License: CC BY-SA 4.0), CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=30677472\nSpelt: Sten / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nSesame: Krish Dulal / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nPompeii Map: MapMaster / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nVilla San Marco: Mentnafunangann / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nRuins of Pompeii: ElfQrin / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\nPompeii Bakery: Wknight94 / CC BY-SA (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\nBakery of Popidius Priscus: Carole Raddato from FRANKFURT, Germany / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)\n\nMusic Credits:\nBlood Eagle by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nAttribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nPrelude Cello Suite 3\nExzel Music Publishing (freemusicpublicdomain.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n#tastinghistory #panisquadratus #romanbread #pompeiibread #ancientrome"

If you wish, add additional cheese to the tops of the tomatoes before placing them in the oven.\n5. Remove the pan from the oven and plate the tomatoes garnishing with herbs.\n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nVincenzo Corrado (book author); luigi erario (Luigi Erario: photographer) / Public domain\nMargherita Pizza - Valerio Capello at English Wikipedia / CC BY-SA (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\nFamous Original Ray\u2019s - Dave Winer at Flickr  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\nRomeo giving money to an apothecary: Wellcome Collection gallery (2018-04-02): https://wellcomecollection.org/works/kngk4q6x CC-BY-4.0\n\nMUSIC CREDITS\nBushwick Tarentella - Thatched Villagers by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300002\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\n#tastinghistory #tomatoes #italianfood"

Beat the mixture until it is so stiff that it will stand by itself. Then take fresh marrow and dates cut into two or three, and prunes, and put the dates and the prunes and the marrow into a fair coffin made of fair paste, and put the coffin into the oven until it is a little hard. Then draw it out of the oven. Take the liquid and put it into the coffin and fill it up and cast enough sugar on. If it is Lent, leave the eggs and marrow out, and then serve it forth.\n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 9in pie dough\n- 15 dates  \n- 15 prunes\n- \u00bc cup of bone marrow\n- 1 cup (235ml) of heavy cream \n- 2 eggs\n- 3 Tablespoons of finely minced parsley\n- \u00bc cup (50g) of sugar, more or less if you want. \n- A large pinch of salt  \n\n\nMETHOD\n1. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F/220\u00b0C\n2. Chop the dates and prunes into 2 or 3 pieces each. \n3. Line a pie pan with your dough, then prick the bottom and spread the dates, prunes, and marrow evenly over the bottom, then bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is fully cooked, then allow to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C.\n4. Combine the cream and eggs in a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form. Whisk in the salt and chopped parsley. \n5. Pour the cream and egg mixture into the tart shell and sprinkle the top with sugar. Bake for 20 minutes or until the custard sets and the top starts to brown. There should still be a slight wobble in the middle. Allow to cool before serving. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nDuke of Ireland Coat of Arms - By NsMn - Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11397603\nCrown - Source : http://pluspng.com/crown-png-hd-8715.html\n\nMUSIC CREDITS\nCrusade - Video Classica by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100884\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\n#tastinghistory #richardii #medievalfood",

Beat the mixture until it is so stiff that it will stand by itself. Then take fresh marrow and dates cut into two or three, and prunes, and put the dates and the prunes and the marrow into a fair coffin made of fair paste, and put the coffin into the oven until it is a little hard. Then draw it out of the oven. Take the liquid and put it into the coffin and fill it up and cast enough sugar on. If it is Lent, leave the eggs and marrow out, and then serve it forth.\n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 9in pie dough\n- 15 dates  \n- 15 prunes\n- \u00bc cup of bone marrow\n- 1 cup (235ml) of heavy cream \n- 2 eggs\n- 3 Tablespoons of finely minced parsley\n- \u00bc cup (50g) of sugar, more or less if you want. \n- A large pinch of salt  \n\n\nMETHOD\n1. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F/220\u00b0C\n2. Chop the dates and prunes into 2 or 3 pieces each. \n3. Line a pie pan with your dough, then prick the bottom and spread the dates, prunes, and marrow evenly over the bottom, then bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is fully cooked, then allow to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C.\n4. Combine the cream and eggs in a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form. Whisk in the salt and chopped parsley. \n5. Pour the cream and egg mixture into the tart shell and sprinkle the top with sugar. Bake for 20 minutes or until the custard sets and the top starts to brown. There should still be a slight wobble in the middle. Allow to cool before serving. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nDuke of Ireland Coat of Arms - By NsMn - Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11397603\nCrown - Source : http://pluspng.com/crown-png-hd-8715.html\n\nMUSIC CREDITS\nCrusade - Video Classica by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100884\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\n#tastinghistory #richardii #medievalfood"

Put the fish into the brine in a new earthenware pot, add oregano, put it on a good fire until it boils - i.e., until it begins to reduce. Some people also add defrutum. Let it cool and strain it two or three times, until the liquid is clear. Seal and store it away.\n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS (Amounts are approximate)\n- 2 Quarts (1900ml) Water\n- 1lb (450g) Sea Salt\n- 2 Teaspoons Dried Oregano\n- Defrutum or Honey \n- 2lbs (900g) Whole Fish (oily)\n\nMETHOD\n1. Add salt to the water and stir to dissolve. You may not need the full amount, so start with about 3/4s. Place an egg in the water and if the egg floats, stop adding salt. \n2. Add the whole fish and the oregano (and defrutum if you are using any) to the water and place over medium-high heat and boil for 30 - 40 minutes. Every ten minutes, mash with a spoon to break up the fish.\n3. Once the water has reduced to about half the amount, remove the pot from the heat and allow to cool. \n4. First, pass through a colander and then strain through a kitchen cloth or paper towel until the garum is free of particles. Then bottle in a sterile bottle and refrigerate. \n\nSend mail to:\nTasting History\n22647 Ventura Blvd, Suite 323\nLos Angeles, CA 91364\n\nMusic Credit\nGigue From 3rd Cello Suite\nExzel Music Publishing (freemusicpublicdomain.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nPhoto Credits\nchef PNG Designed By CHENXIN from https://pngtree.com/\nGarum Mosaic - Claus Ableiter / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nAdana Mosaic - Dosseman / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\nGalen - Wellcome Collection / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)\nSnails Mosaic - Carole Raddato from FRANKFURT, Germany / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)\nSeneca & Nero - By Eduardo Barr\u00f3n - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17141593\n\n#tastinghistory #garum #ancientrome #foodhistory",

Once thickened, remove from the heat and strain through a sieve, then serve. \n\nPhoto Credits: \nMary Berry - Stephen Reed from England / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)\nLamprey - NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)\nMedieval Kitchen - Richard Croft / Medieval kitchen / CC BY-SA 2.0\nSamuel Pegge - Wellcome Collection gallery (2018-04-01): https://wellcomecollection.org/works/uc3axfpx CC-BY-4.0\nStag - By Altaileopard; modified by Wildfeuer - Image:Cervus nippon hortulorum nbg.jpg, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1126487\nSpices of Saude flea market - Wilfredor - CC BY-SA 4.0\nCinnamon - Simon A.

Than putte it in the ovyn ayen a lytil tyme and than take it out, and serve it forth. \n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 450g flour (All-Purpose, Whole Wheat or Bread Flour)\n- 2 egg whites, 1 egg yolk (plus an optional yolk for an egg wash)\n- 2 heaping tablespoons (25g) brown sugar \n- 1 cup warm ale\n- 1 packet (7g) dry yeast\n- 1 stick (113g) butter\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n\nMETHOD\n1. Warm the Ale to between 90\u00b0F and 100\u00b0F (32-28\u00b0C), then mix in the yeast and allow to bloom. Once foamy (about 10 minutes), add the egg whites and 1 yolk and the sugar and mix together. \n2. Sift flour into a large bowl and whisk in the salt. Add in the ale mixture and combine. Once the dough comes together, turn out onto a surface and knead until dough is smooth. Set in a bowl and cover and allow to rise until doubled in size (about 1 hour).\n3. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n4. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 3 equal pieces (or as many rastons as you would like), and form into round loaves. Place loaves on a lined baking tray and allow to rise another 20 minutes. \n5. Once risen, brush the loaves with the extra egg yolk (optional) then score the top of the loaves and bake in the oven for 25 - 30 minutes. One baked, allow to cool on a wire rack. \n6. Melt the butter over a low heat or in the microwave. \n7. Once the loaves are cool, cut a zigzag pattern around the top of the loaf and remove the lid. Pull out all of the inside and crumb it into a bowl, then pour melted butter over the crumbs and mix together. Return the crumbs and any remaining butter to the hollow loaves and place lid back on. Warm in the oven for 5-7 minutes. Then serve it forth. \n\nVIDEO CREDIT\nWinchester City Mill - UKWMO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv6V8CnA08Y\n\n#tastinghistory#Rastons #bread #baking #medievalfood",

Than putte it in the ovyn ayen a lytil tyme and than take it out, and serve it forth. \n\nMODERN RECIPE \nINGREDIENTS\n- 450g flour (All-Purpose, Whole Wheat or Bread Flour)\n- 2 egg whites, 1 egg yolk (plus an optional yolk for an egg wash)\n- 2 heaping tablespoons (25g) brown sugar \n- 1 cup warm ale\n- 1 packet (7g) dry yeast\n- 1 stick (113g) butter\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n\nMETHOD\n1. Warm the Ale to between 90\u00b0F and 100\u00b0F (32-28\u00b0C), then mix in the yeast and allow to bloom. Once foamy (about 10 minutes), add the egg whites and 1 yolk and the sugar and mix together. \n2. Sift flour into a large bowl and whisk in the salt. Add in the ale mixture and combine. Once the dough comes together, turn out onto a surface and knead until dough is smooth. Set in a bowl and cover and allow to rise until doubled in size (about 1 hour).\n3. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n4. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 3 equal pieces (or as many rastons as you would like), and form into round loaves. Place loaves on a lined baking tray and allow to rise another 20 minutes. \n5. Once risen, brush the loaves with the extra egg yolk (optional) then score the top of the loaves and bake in the oven for 25 - 30 minutes. One baked, allow to cool on a wire rack. \n6. Melt the butter over a low heat or in the microwave. \n7. Once the loaves are cool, cut a zigzag pattern around the top of the loaf and remove the lid. Pull out all of the inside and crumb it into a bowl, then pour melted butter over the crumbs and mix together. Return the crumbs and any remaining butter to the hollow loaves and place lid back on. Warm in the oven for 5-7 minutes. Then serve it forth. \n\nVIDEO CREDIT\nWinchester City Mill - UKWMO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv6V8CnA08Y\n\n#tastinghistory#Rastons #bread #baking #medievalfood"

Mould into the form of cakes. A little saffron boiled in the milk enriches the colour of these or any other cakes\n\nMODERN RECIPE (Based on...)\nINGREDIENTS\n- 1 \u00bc cup (280ml) whole milk \n- 6 tablespoons (85g) of butter at room temperature \n- \u00bc cup (50g) sugar\n- 3 3/4 cup (450g) of bread flour (or all purpose)\n- 7g instant yeast or active dry yeast.  \n- 2 eggs (Plus an extra egg for the egg wash)\n- The zest of 1 lemon\n- 1 \u00bd teaspoons of salt\n- 2-3 saffron threads (optional; for color only)\n\nMETHOD\n1. Warm the milk over low heat.* Add the sugar and dissolve. Once warm, add the butter and melt in. If you are using saffron for color, add the threads to the milk and set mixture aside to cool to 110\u00b0 or cooler before adding it to the other ingredients. \n**If you are using instant yeast, heat the full amount of milk. If you are using active dry yeast, warm only 1 cup on the stove. Take the other 1/4 cup and mix with the yeast and a sprinkle of sugar to activate the yeast.\n2. Sift flour into a large bowl or a stand mixer. If using instant yeast, whisk in to flour. Once milk mixture is cooled to 110\u00b0 add to flour and mix (remove saffron threads with a strainer). Add lemon zest, eggs and salt and mix. If you are using active dry yeast, add that last. Work dough until it comes together and forms a smooth sticky dough. (About 8 minutes on medium speed) It will not form into a ball. \n3. Cover and let rise for 60 - 90 minutes or until doubled in size. \n4. Once doubled, punch down dough and put out onto a lightly floured surface and separate into 3 or 6 pieces, depending on the size bun you would like. Form dough into balls and place on lined baking sheet, slightly flattening into a cake. Cover and let rise for another 45 - 60 minutes. \n5. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F / 200\u00b0C and make an egg wash with either a whole egg or egg white (if you used the saffron for color).\n6. Bake buns for 15 minutes, tenting them if they begin to brown too much. An instant read thermometer should read 190\u00b0F-200\u00b0F (approx.90\u00b0C).

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C OR Set a skillet or frying pan over medium high heat. Cooking these on a skillet is closer to the way the Anglo-Saxons would have done it, but it is considerably more difficult. \n2. Add the oats, dried fruit, cinnamon, and salt to a medium bowl and mix well. Then mix in the honey and the butter. Once fully incorporated, add the oat flour and mix to combine.\n3. With your hands, form small flat patties fairly thin and about 3 inches across and set them on a lined baking sheet (or on a plate if you are using a skillet.)\n4. If you are baking the cakes, bake in the oven for 10 - 12 minutes, or until they start to darken around the edges. Place the cakes on a wire rack to cool completely.\nOR\n5. If you are using a skillet or frying pan, gently place several cakes onto the pan. Leave them for 1 - 1\u00bd min, then using a spatula, flip the cakes gently so they do not break, and cook for another 1 minute. The cakes should be browned (possibly slightly scorched) on both sides. Then set them on a wire rack to cool. Repeat until all the cakes are cooked. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nStatue d\u2019Alfred - By Odejea, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=295317\nAravind Sivaraj / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nOat Cakes hanging - Immanuel Giel / Public domain\nJon Thomson from London / Kingussie, UK / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)\nBattle of Ethandun - Trish Steel / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)\nKent Downs - Dimitry B / CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://www.flickr.com/photos/ru_boff/472712409)\n\nMUSIC CREDITS\nCrusade - Video Classica by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100884\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nBlood Eagle by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nAttribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nPeaceful Village by Arthur Vyncke | https://soundcloud.com/arthurvost\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US\n\n#tastinghistory #kingalfred #thelastkingdom #oatcakes #anglosaxon",

Today, we're making those cakes. We'll also look the history around the story and what it tells us of the changing Anglo-Saxon mindset in 9th century England. \n\nHelp Support the Channel with Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/tastinghistory\n\nFollow Tasting History with Max Miller here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tastinghistorywithmaxmiller/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TastingHistory1 \n\nLINKS TO INGREDIENTS**\nSCOTTISH PORRIDGE OATS: https://amzn.to/2W4b5EH\nOATFLOUR: https://amzn.to/2z8u73x\n\nLINKS TO SOURCES**\nThe Last Kingdom - Bernard Cornwell: https://amzn.to/2yvSwjF\nThe Anglo-Saxon World - M.J.

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C OR Set a skillet or frying pan over medium high heat. Cooking these on a skillet is closer to the way the Anglo-Saxons would have done it, but it is considerably more difficult. \n2. Add the oats, dried fruit, cinnamon, and salt to a medium bowl and mix well. Then mix in the honey and the butter. Once fully incorporated, add the oat flour and mix to combine.\n3. With your hands, form small flat patties fairly thin and about 3 inches across and set them on a lined baking sheet (or on a plate if you are using a skillet.)\n4. If you are baking the cakes, bake in the oven for 10 - 12 minutes, or until they start to darken around the edges. Place the cakes on a wire rack to cool completely.\nOR\n5. If you are using a skillet or frying pan, gently place several cakes onto the pan. Leave them for 1 - 1\u00bd min, then using a spatula, flip the cakes gently so they do not break, and cook for another 1 minute. The cakes should be browned (possibly slightly scorched) on both sides. Then set them on a wire rack to cool. Repeat until all the cakes are cooked. \n\nPHOTO CREDITS\nStatue d\u2019Alfred - By Odejea, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=295317\nAravind Sivaraj / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nOat Cakes hanging - Immanuel Giel / Public domain\nJon Thomson from London / Kingussie, UK / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)\nBattle of Ethandun - Trish Steel / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)\nKent Downs - Dimitry B / CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://www.flickr.com/photos/ru_boff/472712409)\n\nMUSIC CREDITS\nCrusade - Video Classica by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100884\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nBlood Eagle by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nAttribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nPeaceful Village by Arthur Vyncke | https://soundcloud.com/arthurvost\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US\n\n#tastinghistory #kingalfred #thelastkingdom #oatcakes #anglosaxon"

Half a pound fresh butter beaten to a cream, 7 eggs (yolks and whites beaten separately, and the whites stirred in the last thing), 1/2 lb. best vanilla chocolate grated and heated in oven, then beaten up in the butter with 3 oz. dried flour, 1/2 lb. sifted sugar, 4 oz. ground almonds, 1 teaspoon of sal volatile. Bake in a slack oven, then ice with a thin soft icing flavored with maraschino. If ingredients are thoroughly beaten up it will be very light. \n\nMODERN METHOD \n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F / 175\u00b0C. Line a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment and butter the bottom and sides of the pan. Then dust with a mixture of flour and sugar and coat the entire pan, tapping out the excess.\n2. In a bowl, combine the flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk gently to blend.\n3. Melt the chocolate either in a microwave oven or in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Set aside to cool.\n4. Separate the eggs into two bowls. Beat yolks to blend, then stir in the vanilla. Whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form.\n5. In a bowl, cream together the butter and superfine sugar until mixed. Mix in the melted chocolate. Mix in a spoonful of the flour mixture to prevent curdling, then gradually beat in the egg yolk mixture. Gradually fold in the remaining flour mixture. Add about one-fourth of the beaten egg whites, folding in just until no white streaks remain. Fold in the remaining egg whites the same way. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.\n6. Place cake in oven and turn temperature down to 250\u00b0F/120\u00b0C. Bake until the cake begins to pull away from the sides of the pan and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 75 - 90 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack, then turn out onto the rack and peel off the parchment. Turn the cake upright and serve plain or with icing. \n7. If making the icing, put the powdered sugar into a bowl, whisk in enough of the liqueur to make a soft pourable icing, and pour over the cake or, make a stiffer icing, and spread on with an offset spatula.\n\nSOURCES\nThe Downton Abbey Cookbook - Annie Gray: https://amzn.to/3aO0LVa\n\nSend mail to:\nTasting History\n22647 Ventura Blvd, Suite 323\nLos Angeles, CA 91364\n\n**Amazon offers a small commission on products sold through their affiliate links, so each purchase made from this link, whether this product or another, will help to support this channel with no additional cost to you.\n\n#tastinghistory #foodhistory #birthdaycake",

Half a pound fresh butter beaten to a cream, 7 eggs (yolks and whites beaten separately, and the whites stirred in the last thing), 1/2 lb. best vanilla chocolate grated and heated in oven, then beaten up in the butter with 3 oz. dried flour, 1/2 lb. sifted sugar, 4 oz. ground almonds, 1 teaspoon of sal volatile. Bake in a slack oven, then ice with a thin soft icing flavored with maraschino. If ingredients are thoroughly beaten up it will be very light. \n\nMODERN METHOD \n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F / 175\u00b0C. Line a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment and butter the bottom and sides of the pan. Then dust with a mixture of flour and sugar and coat the entire pan, tapping out the excess.\n2. In a bowl, combine the flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk gently to blend.\n3. Melt the chocolate either in a microwave oven or in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Set aside to cool.\n4. Separate the eggs into two bowls. Beat yolks to blend, then stir in the vanilla. Whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form.\n5. In a bowl, cream together the butter and superfine sugar until mixed. Mix in the melted chocolate. Mix in a spoonful of the flour mixture to prevent curdling, then gradually beat in the egg yolk mixture. Gradually fold in the remaining flour mixture. Add about one-fourth of the beaten egg whites, folding in just until no white streaks remain. Fold in the remaining egg whites the same way. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.\n6. Place cake in oven and turn temperature down to 250\u00b0F/120\u00b0C. Bake until the cake begins to pull away from the sides of the pan and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 75 - 90 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack, then turn out onto the rack and peel off the parchment. Turn the cake upright and serve plain or with icing. \n7. If making the icing, put the powdered sugar into a bowl, whisk in enough of the liqueur to make a soft pourable icing, and pour over the cake or, make a stiffer icing, and spread on with an offset spatula.\n\nSOURCES\nThe Downton Abbey Cookbook - Annie Gray: https://amzn.to/3aO0LVa\n\nSend mail to:\nTasting History\n22647 Ventura Blvd, Suite 323\nLos Angeles, CA 91364\n\n**Amazon offers a small commission on products sold through their affiliate links, so each purchase made from this link, whether this product or another, will help to support this channel with no additional cost to you.\n\n#tastinghistory #foodhistory #birthdaycake"

And then chop it all finely, and then put it on the fire with water and add a good handful of salt and boil it enough so that it is very soft. And then take it and put it in cold water for nine days, changing the water each day. And, once all the salt is removed, have your honey made, and, well skimmed as it is said before, add it all to the honey or syrup and boil it rapidly so that the syrup is done when it makes threads. And for one pound of horseradish one pound of honey is enough.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n- 80-90g fresh horseradish\n- 1 cup honey\nOR\n- 1/2 cup sugar \n- 1/4 cup water\n\nMODERN METHOD (Based on an interpretation by Daniel Meyers of www.MedievalCookery.com)\n1. Wash and scrape horseradish until it's clean and white.\n2. Slice horseradish into 2 in long strips (about 1/8th inch thick)\n3. Boil horseradish in a small pot for 30 - 40 minutes (add water if needed to prevent scorching)\n4. Drain hot water and transfer horseradish to a small bowl of cold water. Changing the water every hour, leave the horseradish to soak for 6-8 hours; alternatively, follow the original recipe and soak for 9 days changing the water daily. (I have found it doesn't not effect the taste enough to warrant 9 days of work)\n5. Set your honey to boiling or create syrup with sugar and water and then boil. \n6. Once boiling, add your horseradish (minus the water), and allow to boil for 10 minutes, or until the syrup/honey creates thin threads when a piece is taken from the pot. \n7. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.\n8. Serve it forth.\n\nSOURCES\nMedieval Cookery - http://medievalcookery.com/recipes/horseradish.html\n\n**Amazon offers a small commission on products sold through their affiliate links, so each purchase made from this link, whether this product or another, will help to support this channel with no additional cost to you.\n\n#tastinghistory #theplague #theblackdeath",
