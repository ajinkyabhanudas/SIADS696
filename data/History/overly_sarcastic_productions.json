Long before Athens' golden age, before Homer, and even before the Trojan War, there was a civilization on the island of Krete. The land of King Minos was home to beautiful palaces, a fascinatingly-complex economy, and something approximating Bull-Cthulu. It's a fun time, let's jump in.\n\nSOURCES & Further Reading: \"The Greeks: An Illustrated History\" by Diane Cline for National Geographic, \"The Greeks: A Global History\" by Roderick Beaton, Lectures from The Great Courses Plus \u2014 \"Being Minoan and Mycenaean\" from \"The Other Side of History: Daily Life in the Ancient World\" by Robert Garland, and \"Minoan Crete\" & \"Schliemann & Mycenae\" from \"Ancient Greek Civilization\" by Jeremy McInerney.

Long before Athens' golden age, before Homer, and even before the Trojan War, there was a civilization on the island of Krete. The land of King Minos was home to beautiful palaces, a fascinatingly-complex economy, and something approximating Bull-Cthulu. It's a fun time, let's jump in.\n\nSOURCES & Further Reading: \"The Greeks: An Illustrated History\" by Diane Cline for National Geographic, \"The Greeks: A Global History\" by Roderick Beaton, Lectures from The Great Courses Plus \u2014 \"Being Minoan and Mycenaean\" from \"The Other Side of History: Daily Life in the Ancient World\" by Robert Garland, and \"Minoan Crete\" & \"Schliemann & Mycenae\" from \"Ancient Greek Civilization\" by Jeremy McInerney. And I have a university degree in Classical Studies.\n\nOur content is intended for teenage audiences and up.\n\nPATREON: https://www.Patreon.com/OSP\n\nPODCAST: https://overlysarcasticpodcast.transistor.fm/subscribe\n\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/osp\n\nMERCH LINKS: http://rdbl.co/osp\n\nOUR WEBSITE: https://www.OverlySarcasticProductions.com/\nFind us on Twitter https://www.Twitter.com/OSPYouTube\nFind us on Reddit https://www.Reddit.com/r/OSP/\n\nWant this video in another language?

We know there's a truly staggering number of websites dedicated to their stereotypical personality traits! But what do we know about their stories? Let's discuss!\n\nFUN FACT I GLOSSED OVER IN THE VIDEO: like I said, it's REALLY hard to determine when these constellations entered Greece. Most people set the date at 300ish, when Eudoxus codified the Greek calendar based on the Babylonian one - but that clashes with the fact that Heracles's labors predate that by at least three centuries, and they've had those zodiacal themes since that lost epic poem was initially written. We know, therefore, that the babylonian zodiac entered greece between Homer's time (when he conspicuously didn't mention them - and neither did Hesiod in his Astronomia) and Peisander's time (author of the lost Heracleia), basically the interval between 800 and 600 CE. The phoenician traders carrying that info is a reasonable assumption, especially considering how important the stars are to sailors navigating at night. But it is WILD to me how hard this is to research and how nobody seems to have really explored the timeline here!\n\nThree Zodiac merch designs are available on our redbubble!\nThe modern constellations-only zodiac: https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/63493974\nThe MUL*APIN Babylonian zodiac: https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/63494231\nThe Greek zodiac: https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/65281946\n\nOur content is intended for teenage audiences and up.\n\nPATREON: https://www.Patreon.com/OSP\n\nMERCH LINKS: http://rdbl.co/osp\n\nOUR WEBSITE: https://www.OverlySarcasticProductions.com/\nFind us on Twitter https://www.Twitter.com/OSPYouTube\nFind us on Reddit https://www.Reddit.com/r/OSP/",

We know there's a truly staggering number of websites dedicated to their stereotypical personality traits! But what do we know about their stories? Let's discuss!\n\nFUN FACT I GLOSSED OVER IN THE VIDEO: like I said, it's REALLY hard to determine when these constellations entered Greece. Most people set the date at 300ish, when Eudoxus codified the Greek calendar based on the Babylonian one - but that clashes with the fact that Heracles's labors predate that by at least three centuries, and they've had those zodiacal themes since that lost epic poem was initially written. We know, therefore, that the babylonian zodiac entered greece between Homer's time (when he conspicuously didn't mention them - and neither did Hesiod in his Astronomia) and Peisander's time (author of the lost Heracleia), basically the interval between 800 and 600 CE. The phoenician traders carrying that info is a reasonable assumption, especially considering how important the stars are to sailors navigating at night. But it is WILD to me how hard this is to research and how nobody seems to have really explored the timeline here!\n\nThree Zodiac merch designs are available on our redbubble!\nThe modern constellations-only zodiac: https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/63493974\nThe MUL*APIN Babylonian zodiac: https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/63494231\nThe Greek zodiac: https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/65281946\n\nOur content is intended for teenage audiences and up.\n\nPATREON: https://www.Patreon.com/OSP\n\nMERCH LINKS: http://rdbl.co/osp\n\nOUR WEBSITE: https://www.OverlySarcasticProductions.com/\nFind us on Twitter https://www.Twitter.com/OSPYouTube\nFind us on Reddit https://www.Reddit.com/r/OSP/"

It's a favorite of soap operas and anything else that likes quick and easy drama, and when it comes to shuffling around core character traits, amnesia is basically a swiss army knife - need to roll back a week or two of character development? need to revert a character to a clean slate? wanna make one of your lovebirds forget their FIRST KISS? amnesia is the trope for you! and if you're an audience member sick of being emotionally manipulated by writers doing any and all of the above\u2026 WELCOME TO THE PARTY\n\nWhat's YOUR favorite amnesia plot - or, if you've got an axe to grind, what's your LEAST favorite instance of the trope? Yell about it in the comments!\n\nMy favorite example of amnesia done right, which I didn't have time to delve into here, is the season 1 finale/season 2 opener of Transformers Prime, where Optimus Prime sacrifices the Matrix of Leadership to defeat Unicron, and in the process loses all of his memories SINCE HE GAINED THE MATRIX and first BECAME Optimus Prime. He reverts to Orion Pax, a simple pacifist librarian who believes Megatron is still \"Megatronus\", his best friend and fellow activist. He doesn't know ANY of the autobots, since technically speaking, Megatron IS his oldest friend - so he ends up working with the Decepticons for MULTIPLE EPISODES as the Autobots try and get a working backup copy of the Matrix of Leadership to restore Prime's memories. It's a uniquely fascinating look into the mind of a truly ancient and very battle-hardened being from BEFORE he became the most iconic leader in science fiction - the seeds of the noble paragon he'd become without the weight of worlds on his shoulders. Orion Pax doesn't even BELIEVE he could be a Prime, because he doesn't think he's WORTHY of it. And even without his memory, Orion Pax figures out that Megatron is lying to him and being all evil and stuff, and rebels all on his own without Autobot help (and then gets his ass kicked because Orion Pax has no idea how to fight, oops). It's honestly such a fun arc (and I have to give ENDLESS credit to both the animators and to Prime's voice actor, Peter Cullen, who, exclusively through facial expression and tone of voice, manage to communicate a much younger, much less experienced Prime despite his appearance being totally unchanged. It's so well-done, even before he talks you can tell something's wrong.)\n\nEXAMPLES USED (in rough order of first appearance): Transformers Prime (Orion Pax p.1), Death Note, Blindspot, Doctor Who (Utopia), Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Captain Marvel, Batman: The Animated Series (Forgotten), The Iron Giant, Frozen, She-Ra (Remember), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Young Justice (Bereft), Wall-E, Gravity Falls (finale), Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Wreck-It Ralph, Captain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nPATREON: https://www.Patreon.com/OSP\n\nMERCH LINKS: https://www.redbubble.com/people/OSPYouTube\n\nOUR WEBSITE: https://www.OverlySarcasticProductions.com/\nFind us on Twitter https://www.Twitter.com/OSPYouTube\nFind us on Reddit https://www.Reddit.com/r/OSP/",

And by \"Like That\" I mean impenetrably complicated. I did my best, I'll say that, but oh man is history a mess in the 15-1900s. This stuff is the reason I had so much trouble with history for so long. It's just so DENSE.\nANYWAY, join Blue and Griffin the Armchair Historian for a look into the history of the multiple successive French Empires. Listen carefully as Blue makes imperceptibly subtle commentary about his extremely non-biased opinions on this chapter in history, and laugh together as we analyze the historical significance of Napoleon Bonaparte's anime hair.\n\nNOTE on 6:14 \u2014 I say Napoleon became Emperor in 1802. That's a mistake. In 1802, the constitution of France was amended to make the position of Consul permanent, but Napoleon did not become the Emperor until 1804, when he declared the French Empire. That's my bad.\nNOTE on 11:25 \u2014 French Guiana, on the northeast coast of South America, remained part of France following the decolonization of Africa. That's a mapping mix-up.\n\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/sS5K4R3\n\nPATREON: https://www.Patreon.com/OSP\n\nMERCH LINKS: https://www.redbubble.com/people/OSPYouTube\n\nOUR WEBSITE: https://www.OverlySarcasticProductions.com/\nFind us on Twitter https://www.Twitter.com/OSPYouTube\nFind us on Reddit https://www.Reddit.com/r/OSP/",

And by \"Like That\" I mean impenetrably complicated. I did my best, I'll say that, but oh man is history a mess in the 15-1900s. This stuff is the reason I had so much trouble with history for so long. It's just so DENSE.\nANYWAY, join Blue and Griffin the Armchair Historian for a look into the history of the multiple successive French Empires. Listen carefully as Blue makes imperceptibly subtle commentary about his extremely non-biased opinions on this chapter in history, and laugh together as we analyze the historical significance of Napoleon Bonaparte's anime hair.\n\nNOTE on 6:14 \u2014 I say Napoleon became Emperor in 1802. That's a mistake. In 1802, the constitution of France was amended to make the position of Consul permanent, but Napoleon did not become the Emperor until 1804, when he declared the French Empire. That's my bad.\nNOTE on 11:25 \u2014 French Guiana, on the northeast coast of South America, remained part of France following the decolonization of Africa. That's a mapping mix-up.\n\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/sS5K4R3\n\nPATREON: https://www.Patreon.com/OSP\n\nMERCH LINKS: https://www.redbubble.com/people/OSPYouTube\n\nOUR WEBSITE: https://www.OverlySarcasticProductions.com/\nFind us on Twitter https://www.Twitter.com/OSPYouTube\nFind us on Reddit https://www.Reddit.com/r/OSP/"

Protect yourself online today!\n\nMalta, the Island of A Dozen Empires, chilling in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, is one of the most social butterflies in History. Having played host to or fought against every major power in the Mediterranean, this island bears a gorgeous architectural and linguistic record of its past, and is still a treasure to behold in the modern day. I've covered a lot of nations and empires in my time here, but between the rich cultural blends, the overflowing artistic treasures, and the Still-In-One-Piece-ness of it all, Malta may have one of the strongest claims to being the Winner of History in my book. What's so special about Malta? Watch and find out!\n\nNOTE on 7:00 - 7:08 \u2014 I'm cheating the time-scales a little here. This church, the Rotunda of Mosta, was actually built mid 1800s. Malta's lavish church construction continued nearly unabated from C. 1565 to the modern day, so I use this example here \u2014 but St Paul's Co-Cathedral in Valletta, shown from 6:27-6:33 is a better example of pure original Baroque construction.

Protect yourself online today!\n\nMalta, the Island of A Dozen Empires, chilling in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, is one of the most social butterflies in History. Having played host to or fought against every major power in the Mediterranean, this island bears a gorgeous architectural and linguistic record of its past, and is still a treasure to behold in the modern day. I've covered a lot of nations and empires in my time here, but between the rich cultural blends, the overflowing artistic treasures, and the Still-In-One-Piece-ness of it all, Malta may have one of the strongest claims to being the Winner of History in my book.

A concept as old as insert obvious joke here! Today let's talk about how time travel works (or doesn't) and why its stories can be a little\u2026 weird sometimes.\n\nWhat's your favorite time plot? Also, which doctor/companion is your fave? (Mine's 10 and Martha deserved better)\n\nEXAMPLES USED: Doctor Who (s1e1, An Unearthly Child), Doctor Who (s1e2, The Daleks), Doctor Who (s29e7, 42), The Terminator, Back to the Future, Gravity Falls (s1e9, The Time Traveler's Pig), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (s1e1, Pilot), Justice League (s1e24-26, The Savage Time), Samurai Jack (s1e1, I), Samurai Jack (s5e7, XCVIII), Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, Doctor Who (s28e9, Rise of the Cybermen), Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Doctor Who (s31e12, The Pandorica Opens), Assassin's Creed, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Thundercats 2011 (s1e7, Legacy), The Flash (s4e23, We Are The Flash), Justice League (s3e12-13, The Once and Future Thing), Kim Possible: A Sitch In Time, Doctor Who (s30e11, Turn Left), Terminator: Genisys, Doctor Who (s27e8, Father's Day), Doctor Who (s30e2, The Fires of Pompeii), Doctor Who (s29e11-13, Utopia/The Sound of Drums/Last of the Time Lords), Doctor Who (s27e12-13, Bad Wolf/The Parting Of The Ways), The Flash (s1e23, Fast Enough)\n\nDo you know how many of these examples had Will Friedle in a starring role? MORE THAN I EXPECTED. Dude is prolific. Did you know he played Ron Stoppable AND ALSO BATMAN?\n\nPATREON: www.patreon.com/user?u=4664797\n\nMERCH LINKS:\nShirts - https://overlysarcasticproducts.threadless.com/designs\nAll the other stuff - http://www.cafepress.com/OverlySarcasticProducts\n\nFind us on Twitter @OSPYouTube!",

A concept as old as insert obvious joke here! Today let's talk about how time travel works (or doesn't) and why its stories can be a little\u2026 weird sometimes.\n\nWhat's your favorite time plot? Also, which doctor/companion is your fave? (Mine's 10 and Martha deserved better)\n\nEXAMPLES USED: Doctor Who (s1e1, An Unearthly Child), Doctor Who (s1e2, The Daleks), Doctor Who (s29e7, 42), The Terminator, Back to the Future, Gravity Falls (s1e9, The Time Traveler's Pig), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (s1e1, Pilot), Justice League (s1e24-26, The Savage Time), Samurai Jack (s1e1, I), Samurai Jack (s5e7, XCVIII), Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, Doctor Who (s28e9, Rise of the Cybermen), Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Doctor Who (s31e12, The Pandorica Opens), Assassin's Creed, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Thundercats 2011 (s1e7, Legacy), The Flash (s4e23, We Are The Flash), Justice League (s3e12-13, The Once and Future Thing), Kim Possible: A Sitch In Time, Doctor Who (s30e11, Turn Left), Terminator: Genisys, Doctor Who (s27e8, Father's Day), Doctor Who (s30e2, The Fires of Pompeii), Doctor Who (s29e11-13, Utopia/The Sound of Drums/Last of the Time Lords), Doctor Who (s27e12-13, Bad Wolf/The Parting Of The Ways), The Flash (s1e23, Fast Enough)\n\nDo you know how many of these examples had Will Friedle in a starring role?

Did Lovecraft write some pretty incredible horror? Sure! Was he also a raging xenophobe? Absolutely! Are his perspectives on life connected with the stories he felt compelled to tell? Duh! If you look at Lovecraft's writing through the lens of his life, clear patterns emerge that allow us to pin down what exactly he built his horror cosmology out of. It's an invaluable analytical tool that allows us to take apart his writings by getting inside his head. So before you yell at me for Not Separating The Artist From The Art, know that it was completely intentional and I'm not sorry.\n\n3:20 - THE CALL OF CTHULHU\n8:40 - COOL AIR\n10:36 - THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE\n14:38 - THE DUNWICH HORROR\n19:32 - THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH\n\nPATREON: www.patreon.com/user?u=4664797\n\nMERCH LINKS:\nShirts - https://overlysarcasticproducts.threadless.com/designs\nAll the other stuff - http://www.cafepress.com/OverlySarcasticProducts\n\nFind us on Twitter @OSPYouTube!",

Did Lovecraft write some pretty incredible horror? Sure! Was he also a raging xenophobe? Absolutely! Are his perspectives on life connected with the stories he felt compelled to tell? Duh! If you look at Lovecraft's writing through the lens of his life, clear patterns emerge that allow us to pin down what exactly he built his horror cosmology out of. It's an invaluable analytical tool that allows us to take apart his writings by getting inside his head. So before you yell at me for Not Separating The Artist From The Art, know that it was completely intentional and I'm not sorry.\n\n3:20 - THE CALL OF CTHULHU\n8:40 - COOL AIR\n10:36 - THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE\n14:38 - THE DUNWICH HORROR\n19:32 - THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH\n\nPATREON: www.patreon.com/user?u=4664797\n\nMERCH LINKS:\nShirts - https://overlysarcasticproducts.threadless.com/designs\nAll the other stuff - http://www.cafepress.com/OverlySarcasticProducts\n\nFind us on Twitter @OSPYouTube!"

But that doesn't mean it's not worth talking about! LET'S BREAK IT DOWN\n\nAlso, Red is\u2026 doing something? I think? so it's Blue's time to shine in this narrative breakdown of a multi-part troping juggernaut!\n\nWhat was YOUR \"oh hey, they did that bit in [story]\" moment from this video?

But at heart, The Hero's Journey was an attempt to tie every hero story together into one narrative structure that described them all. Was it a success? No! But that doesn't mean it's not worth talking about! LET'S BREAK IT DOWN\n\nAlso, Red is\u2026 doing something? I think? so it's Blue's time to shine in this narrative breakdown of a multi-part troping juggernaut!\n\nWhat was YOUR \"oh hey, they did that bit in [story]\" moment from this video?

Some people will smugly inform you that the Sword in the Stone isn't Excalibur; some will equally smugly tell you that the stone was actually an anvil. Is Merlin a druid, a wizard, a demon, a time-traveler? Is Morgan Le Fay Arthur's sister, nemesis, lover, all of the above? And where the hell does Mordred fit into all this? To answer these questions, let's go all the way back to the beginning and trace how this mythos grew and evolved as it moved from writer to writer and culture to culture. And this is a long one, so strap in, folks!\n\nWould you believe there's no guitar tab for \"C'est Moi\" anywhere online?

Some people will smugly inform you that the Sword in the Stone isn't Excalibur; some will equally smugly tell you that the stone was actually an anvil. Is Merlin a druid, a wizard, a demon, a time-traveler? Is Morgan Le Fay Arthur's sister, nemesis, lover, all of the above? And where the hell does Mordred fit into all this? To answer these questions, let's go all the way back to the beginning and trace how this mythos grew and evolved as it moved from writer to writer and culture to culture. And this is a long one, so strap in, folks!\n\nWould you believe there's no guitar tab for \"C'est Moi\" anywhere online? So inconsiderate.\n\nPATREON: www.patreon.com/user?u=4664797\n\nMERCH LINKS:\nShirts - https://overlysarcasticproducts.threadless.com/designs\nAll the other stuff - http://www.cafepress.com/OverlySarcasticProducts\n\nFind us on Twitter @OSPYouTube!"

But sometimes, \"chosen one\" is more than just \"designated hero\" and actually opens the story up for some interesting plotlines! So to celebrate this happy new year, let's all talk about what it means to be a Chosen One!\n\nYeah I know that one Lord of the Rings clip widescreened itself off the projector.

For such a well-known literary device, it really doesn't seem to MEAN much most of the time. But sometimes, \"chosen one\" is more than just \"designated hero\" and actually opens the story up for some interesting plotlines! So to celebrate this happy new year, let's all talk about what it means to be a Chosen One!\n\nYeah I know that one Lord of the Rings clip widescreened itself off the projector. My bad~\n\nGot a favorite chosen one/chosen one type?

                "description": "I know, I know, it sounds really weird and niche. Don't worry, it's actually a very widespread thing! Today we explore the \"Planet Of Hats\" problem - a fictional society where the culture is defined as simply as \"everyone wears a funny hat\" (but substitute \"wears a funny hat\" for \"is a warrior\", \"has fourteen wives\", \"loves nature\", etc). Very common in fantasy and sci-fi, mostly because they're a lot easier to write than an original and realistically complicated fictional culture. But as a consequence, they're also a lot more boring and don't give you nearly as many story hooks or character ideas.\n\nDo you have a favorite well-developed fictional society?

                    "description": "I know, I know, it sounds really weird and niche. Don't worry, it's actually a very widespread thing! Today we explore the \"Planet Of Hats\" problem - a fictional society where the culture is defined as simply as \"everyone wears a funny hat\" (but substitute \"wears a funny hat\" for \"is a warrior\", \"has fourteen wives\", \"loves nature\", etc). Very common in fantasy and sci-fi, mostly because they're a lot easier to write than an original and realistically complicated fictional culture. But as a consequence, they're also a lot more boring and don't give you nearly as many story hooks or character ideas.\n\nDo you have a favorite well-developed fictional society?

For all I myself have said about the Athenian empire, seeing the view from this temple made everything click into place and feel tangibly real for the first time ever (even my 10+ trips to the Parthenon over the course of my childhood didn't do that). So uh... here's 7 minutes of me gushing about it under the thin guise of persuasive historical argumentation.\n\nPATREON: www.patreon.com/user?u=4664797\n\nMERCH LINKS:\nShirts - https://overlysarcasticproducts.threadless.com/designs\nAll the other stuff - http://www.cafepress.com/OverlySarcasticProducts\n\nFind us on Twitter @OSPYouTube!"

But today we'll be talking about what happens when you do damseling RIGHT, because I'm optimistic like that.\n\nWho's your favorite damsel, and what kind of damseling do you think works best?

The tale of the baddest Geat to ever Geat.\n\nTolkien said that the Dragon in Beowulf is one of only two *true* dragons in all of literature - the other being Fafnir. The influence of both these dragons is very visible in a lot of our more modern fantasy: for instance, where Beowulf's Dragon inspired Smaug, o chiefest and greatest of calamities, Fafnir inspired C. S. Lewis to include that cursed bracelet thing that turned Eustace into a dragon in Voyage of the Dawn Treader. And I think we all know the badder of those two dragons, so I guess Tolkien - and, by extension, Beowulf - wins this round.\n\nWhere was I? Right.

The tale of the baddest Geat to ever Geat.\n\nTolkien said that the Dragon in Beowulf is one of only two *true* dragons in all of literature - the other being Fafnir. The influence of both these dragons is very visible in a lot of our more modern fantasy: for instance, where Beowulf's Dragon inspired Smaug, o chiefest and greatest of calamities, Fafnir inspired C. S. Lewis to include that cursed bracelet thing that turned Eustace into a dragon in Voyage of the Dawn Treader. And I think we all know the badder of those two dragons, so I guess Tolkien - and, by extension, Beowulf - wins this round.\n\nWhere was I? Right.

Surely you've awaited this moment with bated breath. As always, I am happy to oblige."
