But for a time, few people knew he was actually a son of one of the world's most infamous dictators, and he'd changed his name in order to protect himself and his career. Full's father, Benito Mussolini, created the Italian Fascist Party in 1915 and became prime minister of the country in 1922. He made sweeping social changes, reduced unemployment, and for a time, earned the respect of his countrymen who nicknamed him \"Il Duce\" (The Leader). Mussolini made a military pact with Adolf Hitler in 1939, forcing the country into World War II in 1941.\n\n\n#RomanoMussolini #musichistory  #weirdhistory",

But for a time, few people knew he was actually a son of one of the world's most infamous dictators, and he'd changed his name in order to protect himself and his career. Full's father, Benito Mussolini, created the Italian Fascist Party in 1915 and became prime minister of the country in 1922. He made sweeping social changes, reduced unemployment, and for a time, earned the respect of his countrymen who nicknamed him \"Il Duce\" (The Leader). Mussolini made a military pact with Adolf Hitler in 1939, forcing the country into World War II in 1941.\n\n\n#RomanoMussolini #musichistory  #weirdhistory"

The famous Renaissance artist's paintings, sculptures, and architectural achievements are as stunning as his intellectual contributions to history, anatomy, and mathematics.\n\n\nOne of the areas where Leonardo truly excelled was inventing. While observing the world around him, Leonardo took copious notes and made sketches detailing his surroundings. In the process, he came up with practical and impractical mechanisms alike, many designed to be used as tools of destruction.\n\n\n#leonardodavinci #war #weirdhistory",

The famous Renaissance artist's paintings, sculptures, and architectural achievements are as stunning as his intellectual contributions to history, anatomy, and mathematics.\n\n\nOne of the areas where Leonardo truly excelled was inventing. While observing the world around him, Leonardo took copious notes and made sketches detailing his surroundings. In the process, he came up with practical and impractical mechanisms alike, many designed to be used as tools of destruction.\n\n\n#leonardodavinci #war #weirdhistory"

The history of the Wild West is full of myths and stereotypes, but the truth about justice in the West is often more complicated - and more unsettling.\n\nViolence plagued the American West. Settlers faced rising numbers of illegal acts as people poured into the frontier searching for new lives, and communities had to handle justice on their own. \n\n\n\n#wildwest #oldwest  #weirdhistory"

The initial group of settlers, all male, arrived and built James Fort in 1607, a private, corporate adventure. Much opportunity, along with much risk, lay waiting in the New World. But within a year, the men already complained about the lack of female company.

The initial group of settlers, all male, arrived and built James Fort in 1607, a private, corporate adventure. Much opportunity, along with much risk, lay waiting in the New World. But within a year, the men already complained about the lack of female company. To satisfy the colonial men, the Virginia Company sent over the bride ships of 1619, enticing the women with hopes for a better life while satiating the men's demands.\n\n\n#jamestown #America #weirdhistory"

By the time the Russian Revolution was over, the government, economy, and social framework of Russia were under a new order that would lead to decades of global divisiveness.\n\n\n#RussianRevolution #VladimirLenin #WeirdHistory",

By the time the Russian Revolution was over, the government, economy, and social framework of Russia were under a new order that would lead to decades of global divisiveness.\n\n\n#RussianRevolution #VladimirLenin #WeirdHistory"

It was a lark, an afterthought, something recorded in roughly an hour that the band didn\u2019t plan to release. It was ultimately Nirvana\u2019s final album, giving fans one of the most unbelievable Kurt Cobain performances, as well as a strange foreshadowing of Cobain\u2019s passing. In hindsight, the show mirrors Cobain\u2019s life, one that was complicated by mental health issues and substance dependency.\n\n\nThe performance, recorded on November 18, 1993, has been called \u201cpersonal\" and \u201craw,\u201d but it\u2019s just Nirvana doing what they do best.\n\n\n#Nirvana #MTV #WeirdHistory",

                    "description": "Nirvana\u2019s MTV Unplugged in New York was never meant to be a big deal. It was a lark, an afterthought, something recorded in roughly an hour that the band didn\u2019t plan to release. It was ultimately Nirvana\u2019s final album, giving fans one of the most unbelievable Kurt Cobain performances, as well as a strange foreshadowing of Cobain\u2019s passing. In hindsight, the show mirrors Cobain\u2019s life, one that was complicated by mental health issues and substance dependency.\n\n\nThe performance, recorded on November 18, 1993, has been called \u201cpersonal\" and \u201craw,\u201d but it\u2019s just Nirvana doing what they do best.\n\n\n#Nirvana #MTV #WeirdHistory"

He tried to swim to shore for help, and that was the last time anyone saw him alive.\nThumbnail: \nImage: MichaelRockefeller.jpg\nAuth: HurrayForZay\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rockefeller#/media/File:Michael_Rockefeller.jpg\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\n\n\n#MichaelRockefeller #worldnews #weirdhistory"

Bild Lilli is a doll with heavy makeup, a fierce backstory, and a curvy body eerily similar to Barbie's and some have described her as \"Barbie\u2019s ballsy European precursor.\" \n\n\nMattel co-founder Ruth Handler first encountered Bild Lilli in Switzerland in the mid-1950s, and saw the doll's potential for American consumers. But Lilli was a very different kind of doll than what Barbie eventually became.\n\n\n#Barbie #Mattell #WeirdHistory",

Bild Lilli is a doll with heavy makeup, a fierce backstory, and a curvy body eerily similar to Barbie's and some have described her as \"Barbie\u2019s ballsy European precursor.\" \n\n\nMattel co-founder Ruth Handler first encountered Bild Lilli in Switzerland in the mid-1950s, and saw the doll's potential for American consumers. But Lilli was a very different kind of doll than what Barbie eventually became.\n\n\n#Barbie #Mattell #WeirdHistory"

For every celebrity that totally lied on MTV's Cribs, there's a producer or two who faked a scene on Pimp My Ride. Reality TV lies are a dime a dozen \u2013 but then there was Punk'd.\n\nPunk'd was arguably one of the realest reality shows on MTV. But producers had no qualms about cutting up their actual reactions and making it look like host Ashton Kutcher could not be beat.\n\n\n\n#Punk'd #MTV #WeirdHistory"

These days, many people dab on a touch of perfume or cologne every morning, but perfume in the past was a luxury item associated with deities.

They were a mysterious group of people who resided in what is now northern England and southern Scotland and popped up in the annals of Roman history in the first few centuries CE. Although not a great deal is known about the Picts, historians do know that they caused quite a bit of trouble for the Romans, who were trying to conquer every inch of land they could get their spears on. However, there are plenty of Pict facts aside from their Roman relationships.\n\n\n#ThePicts #AncientRomans #WeirdHistory"

In the 14th century, In\u00eas de Castro's affair with and secret marriage to the heir to Portugal's throne enraged Dom Pedro's father, who hired men to slay her. When the hired blades struck, finishing de Castro in front of her children, Pedro went into a rage and declared war against his father. Years later, after he became King Peter I of Portugal, revenge was the only thing on Pedro's mind. He had his wife posthumously declared Queen of Portugal and propped her decaying body on a throne so the nobility could honor her. \n\n\n\n#InesDeCastro #PortugueseHistory #WeirdHistory",

In the 14th century, In\u00eas de Castro's affair with and secret marriage to the heir to Portugal's throne enraged Dom Pedro's father, who hired men to slay her. When the hired blades struck, finishing de Castro in front of her children, Pedro went into a rage and declared war against his father. Years later, after he became King Peter I of Portugal, revenge was the only thing on Pedro's mind. He had his wife posthumously declared Queen of Portugal and propped her decaying body on a throne so the nobility could honor her. \n\n\n\n#InesDeCastro #PortugueseHistory #WeirdHistory"

They wanted to be able to come home after a long day of work, put on their favorite 1950s TV show, and enjoy a quickly cooked meal with their families. Refrigerators were more accessible to the average family than ever before and they soon came to change the American palate.\n\n\n#1950s #NuclearFamily #WeirdHistory",

They wanted to be able to come home after a long day of work, put on their favorite 1950s TV show, and enjoy a quickly cooked meal with their families. Refrigerators were more accessible to the average family than ever before and they soon came to change the American palate.\n\n\n#1950s #NuclearFamily #WeirdHistory"

This is especially true of medieval weapons and warfare. Depictions of medieval warfare often portray it as chaotic and brutal, with two armies bashing away at each other with swords and shields. In reality, medieval warfare could be nearly as complex as it is today. Though medieval and early modern societies didn't have modern advantages like electricity, combustion engines, or industrial manufacturing, they were still capable of producing massive weapons that could devastate the battlefield. \n\n\n\n#MedievalHistory #Superweapons #WeirdHistory",

This is especially true of medieval weapons and warfare. Depictions of medieval warfare often portray it as chaotic and brutal, with two armies bashing away at each other with swords and shields. In reality, medieval warfare could be nearly as complex as it is today. Though medieval and early modern societies didn't have modern advantages like electricity, combustion engines, or industrial manufacturing, they were still capable of producing massive weapons that could devastate the battlefield. \n\n\n\n#MedievalHistory #Superweapons #WeirdHistory"

In first and second class, Titanic passengers had access to public and private spaces with state-of-the-art amenities. Even in steerage, travelers didn't have much to complain about, with regular meals, electricity, and other comforts they may never have experienced before. \n\n\nThe Titanic was tidy, shiny, and almost everything it was advertised to be - a true Queen of the Ocean.\n\n\n#TheTitanic #Hygiene #WeirdHistory",

First-class passengers traveling on the Titanic enjoyed some of the most luxurious bathing, dining, and recreational facilities to have ever been found at sea, while third-class passengers had to prove themselves clean just to get on board.\n\nPassengers on the Titanic spent their days and nights on the magnificent vessel, enjoying food in abundance while being tended to around every turn. In first and second class, Titanic passengers had access to public and private spaces with state-of-the-art amenities. Even in steerage, travelers didn't have much to complain about, with regular meals, electricity, and other comforts they may never have experienced before. \n\n\nThe Titanic was tidy, shiny, and almost everything it was advertised to be - a true Queen of the Ocean.\n\n\n#TheTitanic #Hygiene #WeirdHistory"

Who are the Blue Fugates? The title refers to members of the Fugate family of eastern Kentucky, particularly those who lived in the early- to mid-20th century. And according to firsthand accounts, the title is no exaggeration.\n\n\nWhy did the Fugates turn blue? The short answer has to do with a genetic mutation arising from inbreeding. The longer answer has to do with recessive genes and bizarre happenstance. If the Fugates hadn't lived in such a rural area, their condition might not have become so pronounced.\n\n\n#Genetics #TheFugates #WeirdHistory",

Who are the Blue Fugates? The title refers to members of the Fugate family of eastern Kentucky, particularly those who lived in the early- to mid-20th century. And according to firsthand accounts, the title is no exaggeration.\n\n\nWhy did the Fugates turn blue? The short answer has to do with a genetic mutation arising from inbreeding. The longer answer has to do with recessive genes and bizarre happenstance. If the Fugates hadn't lived in such a rural area, their condition might not have become so pronounced.\n\n\n#Genetics #TheFugates #WeirdHistory"

As a royal residence and an official state building, Buckingham Palace operates in both private and public spheres. Buckingham Palace on the inside contains rooms designated for official purposes, with private apartments nearby for the queen and members of her family.\n\n\nLiving and working in Buckingham Palace comes with a variety of perks - staff enjoy everything from medical services to exercise facilities. Some of the challenges of the aging structure, including a leaking roof and falling detritus, may not seem like the ideal living situation, but as part of Buckingham Palace's history, these defects could just be considered part of the building's charm. The size and grandeur of Buckingham Palace exceeds general knowledge, and maybe even expectation, giving individuals living in Buckingham Palace access to much more than meets the eye.\n\n\n#BuckinghamPalace #BritishHistory #WeirdHistory",

As a royal residence and an official state building, Buckingham Palace operates in both private and public spheres. Buckingham Palace on the inside contains rooms designated for official purposes, with private apartments nearby for the queen and members of her family.\n\n\nLiving and working in Buckingham Palace comes with a variety of perks - staff enjoy everything from medical services to exercise facilities. Some of the challenges of the aging structure, including a leaking roof and falling detritus, may not seem like the ideal living situation, but as part of Buckingham Palace's history, these defects could just be considered part of the building's charm. The size and grandeur of Buckingham Palace exceeds general knowledge, and maybe even expectation, giving individuals living in Buckingham Palace access to much more than meets the eye.\n\n\n#BuckinghamPalace #BritishHistory #WeirdHistory"

Sharp spikes lined up with the eyes, causing blinding pain.\n\nIt might be featured in multiple torture museums, but did the iron maiden exist? \n\n\n\n#IronMaiden #EuropeanHistory #WeirdHistory",

The medieval torture device, a human-sized sarcophagus filled with spikes, seems almost too gruesome to be true. According to 19th-century scholars, the iron maiden caused a slow, painful end, as people bled from shallow wounds while their torturers opened and closed the contraption's doors to impale them. Sharp spikes lined up with the eyes, causing blinding pain.\n\nIt might be featured in multiple torture museums, but did the iron maiden exist? \n\n\n\n#IronMaiden #EuropeanHistory #WeirdHistory"

In addition, the War of 1812 ended; Napoleon Bonaparte lost at Waterloo; and Otto von Bismarck was born. The year 1816, in particular, stands out as being almost as tragic as 536 CE.\n\nKnown as the \"Year Without a Summer,\" 1816 negatively impacted the entire world, from the most poverty-stricken farmer in China to Thomas Jefferson. In 1815, Mount Tambora erupted, and its aftermath spurred droughts, crop failure, and endless winter.\n\n\n#1816 #MountTambora #WeirdHistory"

But on that fateful day in 1865, General Lee's surrender set the precedent for other massive surrenders that led to the official end of the war.\n\n\n#USCivilWar #USHistory #WeirdHistory"

Peasants actually had a lot more free time than you might expect. They got every Sunday off, as well as special holidays mandated by the church, not to mention weeks off here and there for special events like weddings and births when they spent a lot of time getting drunk. One estimate is that during the 1300s, peasants might only have worked 150 days a year.\n\n\n#MedievalEra #MedievalPeasants #WeirdHistory",

Peasants actually had a lot more free time than you might expect. They got every Sunday off, as well as special holidays mandated by the church, not to mention weeks off here and there for special events like weddings and births when they spent a lot of time getting drunk. One estimate is that during the 1300s, peasants might only have worked 150 days a year.\n\n\n#MedievalEra #MedievalPeasants #WeirdHistory"

In the third century, a Roman emperor named Valerian is alleged to have died when his rival poured liquid gold down his throat. Valerian\u2019s gruesome death was nearly as bad as the horrific executions in Henry VIII\u2019s time, and that's really saying something. Unfortunately for Valerian, his execution was only one part of his humiliating captivity in the hands of the Persians. That is, if we're to believe the account of Lucius Caecilius Firmianus Lactantius, an early Christian author who was no fan of Valerian's.\n\n\n#EmperorValerian #AncientRome #WeirdHistory",

In the third century, a Roman emperor named Valerian is alleged to have died when his rival poured liquid gold down his throat. Valerian\u2019s gruesome death was nearly as bad as the horrific executions in Henry VIII\u2019s time, and that's really saying something. Unfortunately for Valerian, his execution was only one part of his humiliating captivity in the hands of the Persians. That is, if we're to believe the account of Lucius Caecilius Firmianus Lactantius, an early Christian author who was no fan of Valerian's.\n\n\n#EmperorValerian #AncientRome #WeirdHistory"

It took 14 years to complete and nearly 30 people died from various incidents during its construction.\n\n#BrooklynBridge #NewYorkCity #WeirdHistory"

Eichmann was quickly smuggled out of the country -- unbeknownst to Argentine authorities.\n\n\n#WWIIHistory #Manhunt #WeirdHistory"

He was also a fascinating historical figure and tireless public servant. \n\n\n\n#AlexanderHamilton #FoundingFathers #WeirdHistory",

But with the explosive popularity of the Broadway musical Hamilton, that statement is no longer accurate. Hamilton fever swept America, and he became one of the most popular Founding Fathers, as fans of the musical flocked to historic sites and bought out shelves of books associated with him.\n\nHamilton was not just important in the founding of America. He was also a fascinating historical figure and tireless public servant. \n\n\n\n#AlexanderHamilton #FoundingFathers #WeirdHistory"

But for most, the details of his most famous works (The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn) are more memorable than his biography. In truth, Mark Twain's life story was in many ways as dynamic as the adventures in his books: he traveled widely, underwent his share of tragedy, collaborated with Nikola Tesla, and was even said to be a dead-on-the-money psychic.\n\n\n#MarkTwain #FamousAuthors #WeirdHistory",

But for most, the details of his most famous works (The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn) are more memorable than his biography. In truth, Mark Twain's life story was in many ways as dynamic as the adventures in his books: he traveled widely, underwent his share of tragedy, collaborated with Nikola Tesla, and was even said to be a dead-on-the-money psychic.\n\n\n#MarkTwain #FamousAuthors #WeirdHistory"

Life on the American frontier was hard, without question, but cowboys, pioneers, settlers, miners, and the like also had a fair amount of time to enjoy their surroundings. At the very least, they needed some outlets to blow off steam. \n\nMany pastimes in the Wild West took place at well-known sites like saloons and brothels; however, as various sporting events and recreational activities spread across the country, people in the Wild West were also able to take part in some unique experiences as they came along. Entertainment in the Wild West might not be your idea of fun, but men, women, and children out on the frontier had a fair number of options for ways to spend their free time. \n\n#WildWest #Entertainment #WeirdHistory",

Life on the American frontier was hard, without question, but cowboys, pioneers, settlers, miners, and the like also had a fair amount of time to enjoy their surroundings. At the very least, they needed some outlets to blow off steam. \n\nMany pastimes in the Wild West took place at well-known sites like saloons and brothels; however, as various sporting events and recreational activities spread across the country, people in the Wild West were also able to take part in some unique experiences as they came along. Entertainment in the Wild West might not be your idea of fun, but men, women, and children out on the frontier had a fair number of options for ways to spend their free time. \n\n#WildWest #Entertainment #WeirdHistory"

An elaborate tomb complex in Xi'an, the city-size compound came equipped with everything the emperor would require in the afterlife. Like the Egyptians, the ancient Chinese believed the items they took with them to the grave would accompany them into the afterlife. But instead of burying actual people with him underground, the emperor created clay reproductions of warriors, servants, horses, and other objects. An incredible feat of design, the army also features a number of ancient Chinese inventions, many of which no one realized dated back as far as the Qin dynasty.\n\n\n#TerraCottaArmy #China #WeirdHistory",

An elaborate tomb complex in Xi'an, the city-size compound came equipped with everything the emperor would require in the afterlife. Like the Egyptians, the ancient Chinese believed the items they took with them to the grave would accompany them into the afterlife. But instead of burying actual people with him underground, the emperor created clay reproductions of warriors, servants, horses, and other objects. An incredible feat of design, the army also features a number of ancient Chinese inventions, many of which no one realized dated back as far as the Qin dynasty.\n\n\n#TerraCottaArmy #China #WeirdHistory"

In a country without an aristocracy, suddenly every rich American wanted a duchess in the family. The young women, who often didn't have a choice, became known as the Dollar Princesses. \n\n\nBuying noble titles was an old practice, of course, but Americans took it to a new level with Gilded-Age marriages.

In a country without an aristocracy, suddenly every rich American wanted a duchess in the family. The young women, who often didn't have a choice, became known as the Dollar Princesses. \n\n\nBuying noble titles was an old practice, of course, but Americans took it to a new level with Gilded-Age marriages. American brides carried huge fortunes across the sea, including some of the most lavish dowries in history.\n\n\n#DollarPrincess #BritishAristocracy #WeirdHistory"

                "description": "In the 19th century, physicians argued that Victorian hospitals offered modern, scientific care. But in Vienna, one doctor realized physicians were inadvertently ending the lives of their patients. That's because 19th-century medical practices did not include handwashing.\n\nDr. Ignaz Semmelweis spent years trying to convince other doctors to wash their hands after performing post-mortems. He proved that handwashing could save thousands of lives, and yet most doctors ignored his evidence. One stated it simply wasn't possible for doctors to harm their patients, as \"a gentleman's hands are clean.\" Even after Semmelweis provided solid proof that washing hands and sanitized tools decreased the maternal mortality rate, doctors dismissed his findings. \n\n\n\n#IgnazSemmelweis #MedicalHygiene #WeirdHistory",

                    "description": "In the 19th century, physicians argued that Victorian hospitals offered modern, scientific care. But in Vienna, one doctor realized physicians were inadvertently ending the lives of their patients. That's because 19th-century medical practices did not include handwashing.\n\nDr. Ignaz Semmelweis spent years trying to convince other doctors to wash their hands after performing post-mortems. He proved that handwashing could save thousands of lives, and yet most doctors ignored his evidence. One stated it simply wasn't possible for doctors to harm their patients, as \"a gentleman's hands are clean.\" Even after Semmelweis provided solid proof that washing hands and sanitized tools decreased the maternal mortality rate, doctors dismissed his findings. \n\n\n\n#IgnazSemmelweis #MedicalHygiene #WeirdHistory"

The history of piracy is full of surprises, and these Henry Morgan facts are no exception. \n\n\n\n#CaptainMorgan #Rum #WeirdHistory"

In total, 35 of the 97 people on board died in the disaster along with one ground crewman.\n\nOnce ignited, the ship crashed quickly, with some reporting the entire incident took as little as 32 seconds from the first sign of distress to the airship hitting the ground. The disaster captured the public's attention thanks to the eyewitness testimony of a reporter who was present and the fascinating and disturbing footage filmed during the disaster. \n\n\nThere have been many theories about what went wrong during the fateful flight of the Hindenburg.\n\n\n#TheHindenburg #AviationHistory #WeirdHistory",

In total, 35 of the 97 people on board died in the disaster along with one ground crewman.\n\nOnce ignited, the ship crashed quickly, with some reporting the entire incident took as little as 32 seconds from the first sign of distress to the airship hitting the ground. The disaster captured the public's attention thanks to the eyewitness testimony of a reporter who was present and the fascinating and disturbing footage filmed during the disaster. \n\n\nThere have been many theories about what went wrong during the fateful flight of the Hindenburg.\n\n\n#TheHindenburg #AviationHistory #WeirdHistory"

The notion might seen ridiculous, but enough evidence has come to light in recent years that it\u2019s now a historical certainty \u2013 Hemingway: a Soviet spy. One J.

The notion might seen ridiculous, but enough evidence has come to light in recent years that it\u2019s now a historical certainty \u2013 Hemingway: a Soviet spy. One J.

Diamond Dave led VH from its initial success in 1978 through the coked-out, Spandex days of the 1980s, fronting the band 11 years and running with the devil every single day. A consummate rock star, Dave's over-the-top persona and insane stage antics often overshadowed the genius of the band's music, which more or less conjured the entire genre of hair metal from thin air. David Lee Roth and Van Halen had quite a run together, as these crazy David Lee Roth stories attest. \n\n\n\n#DavidLeeRoth #VanHalen #WeirdHistory",

Diamond Dave led VH from its initial success in 1978 through the coked-out, Spandex days of the 1980s, fronting the band 11 years and running with the devil every single day. A consummate rock star, Dave's over-the-top persona and insane stage antics often overshadowed the genius of the band's music, which more or less conjured the entire genre of hair metal from thin air. David Lee Roth and Van Halen had quite a run together, as these crazy David Lee Roth stories attest. \n\n\n\n#DavidLeeRoth #VanHalen #WeirdHistory"

                "description": "Few exploits of the 20th century could match the courage and perseverance of the Shackleton expedition. Ernest Shackleton became the ultimate model for crisis management when his ill-fated 1914 Antarctic expedition met with disaster. His ship, the Endurance, was stranded amidst the expanding ice floes of the South Atlantic. Initially forced to abandon the vessel (which would eventually sink as a result of the hull being crushed by pack ice), Shackleton established a series of temporary camps on the ice, in the hopes that his party would eventually drift closer to civilization. When this failed, Shackleton was forced to abandon most of his group on remote Elephant Island and attempt a 700-nautical mile journey to the populated outpost of South Georgia Island. \n\n\n\n#SurvivalStories #ErnestShackleton #WeirdHistory",

Ernest Shackleton became the ultimate model for crisis management when his ill-fated 1914 Antarctic expedition met with disaster. His ship, the Endurance, was stranded amidst the expanding ice floes of the South Atlantic. Initially forced to abandon the vessel (which would eventually sink as a result of the hull being crushed by pack ice), Shackleton established a series of temporary camps on the ice, in the hopes that his party would eventually drift closer to civilization. When this failed, Shackleton was forced to abandon most of his group on remote Elephant Island and attempt a 700-nautical mile journey to the populated outpost of South Georgia Island. \n\n\n\n#SurvivalStories #ErnestShackleton #WeirdHistory"

How could they sell products for next to nothing and still make a profit?\n\nWith a business model that\u2019s downright Kafka-esque, music clubs managed to make money hand over fist by maintaining a low overhead, a high markup, and an ever-changing set of confusing rules.

The following slice of music industry history lets you in on how music clubs made money, what customers were paying for, and how exactly they were being screwed.\n\n\n#Music #MusicHistory #WeirdHistory"

Steven Spielberg decided to make the hit television show into a motion picture and he enlisted three other directors to create segments of the film. John Landis, who was a hot commodity after Animal House and The Blues Brothers, was given \"Time Out.\" In this segment, a man tries to make up for past sins by becoming a hero.\n\n#twilightzonethemovie #moviehistory #weirdhistory"

Instead, they resemble miniature versions of middle-aged men, sometimes complete with receding hairlines and ripped muscles. Depictions of weird, prematurely aged babies appeared throughout the medieval era and into the Renaissance when the trend (thankfully) started to fade away. The Renaissance, in particular, may have spawned some of the best paintings of all time, but what's up with all those ugly babies in old paintings? \n\n\n\n#MedievalPaintings #ArtHistory #WeirdHistory",

Instead, they resemble miniature versions of middle-aged men, sometimes complete with receding hairlines and ripped muscles. Depictions of weird, prematurely aged babies appeared throughout the medieval era and into the Renaissance when the trend (thankfully) started to fade away. The Renaissance, in particular, may have spawned some of the best paintings of all time, but what's up with all those ugly babies in old paintings? \n\n\n\n#MedievalPaintings #ArtHistory #WeirdHistory"

Learning what happens inside presidential bunkers and where the president would go during a nuclear attack is useful information, though.\n\nThese bunkers were built in the middle of the 20th century, largely as a response to the mounting nuclear panic that accompanied the Cold War. Raven Rock, built in 1951, was one of the predominant shelters. From the underground city at the Raven Rock Mountain Complex in Pennsylvania, to the Greenbrier Bunker that's hidden in plain sight under a luxury resort in West Virginia, to the top-secret NORAD lair at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, these bunkers are incredibly secure.\n\n\n#NuclearBunker #USHistory #WeirdHistory",

Learning what happens inside presidential bunkers and where the president would go during a nuclear attack is useful information, though.\n\nThese bunkers were built in the middle of the 20th century, largely as a response to the mounting nuclear panic that accompanied the Cold War. Raven Rock, built in 1951, was one of the predominant shelters. From the underground city at the Raven Rock Mountain Complex in Pennsylvania, to the Greenbrier Bunker that's hidden in plain sight under a luxury resort in West Virginia, to the top-secret NORAD lair at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, these bunkers are incredibly secure.\n\n\n#NuclearBunker #USHistory #WeirdHistory"

                "description": "Marvin Gaye was one of twentieth century Motown's brightest and most romantic crooners, and his short-lived singing career was full of range, promise, and tragedy. As a young church singer, Gaye demonstrated his talent and soon branched out to mainstream music and played or sang alongside The Supremes with Diana Ross before launching into his own success. Marvin Gaye songs include duets like \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" with Tammi Terrell and political anthems like \"What's Going On,\" but his death brought all of that to an end. The murder of Marvin Gaye by his own father in 1984 was a shocking event, rife with psychological and substance abuse backstories that clarify - but don't necessarily explain - how he died.\n\n\nUltimately, Marvin Gaye's life was full of ups and downs that brought him back to his parents' house and into the line of his father's fire one day before his 45th birthday.\n\n\n#MarvinGaye #MoTown #WeirdHistory",

                    "description": "Marvin Gaye was one of twentieth century Motown's brightest and most romantic crooners, and his short-lived singing career was full of range, promise, and tragedy. As a young church singer, Gaye demonstrated his talent and soon branched out to mainstream music and played or sang alongside The Supremes with Diana Ross before launching into his own success. Marvin Gaye songs include duets like \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" with Tammi Terrell and political anthems like \"What's Going On,\" but his death brought all of that to an end. The murder of Marvin Gaye by his own father in 1984 was a shocking event, rife with psychological and substance abuse backstories that clarify - but don't necessarily explain - how he died.\n\n\nUltimately, Marvin Gaye's life was full of ups and downs that brought him back to his parents' house and into the line of his father's fire one day before his 45th birthday.\n\n\n#MarvinGaye #MoTown #WeirdHistory"

                "description": "One of the world's most notable feats of architecture is the Colosseum in Rome. Opened in 80 CE by Emperor Titus, this massive structure existed solely to entertain the masses with gladiator fights, animal skirmishes, and, at some point, miniature naval conflicts. While it only took the Romans less than a decade to construct the Colosseum, careful calculation and planning were required. Architects and workers put extensive thought into every detail, from the amphitheater's architectural symmetry to its complex underground maze of corridors and capstans.\n\nFor centuries, we have tried to imagine what occurred in the Colosseum, fleshing out a gory fantasy in film and media. For instance, the movie Gladiator, for all its inaccuracies, attempts to create an image of how Romans lived and fought. What we don't see is the grueling work - typically done by enslaved people - it took to put on one of the Colosseum's gruesome shows. Like sex in Ancient Rome, gladiator fights were about power, both of the Roman empire and of individuals. The complexity and grandiosity of the Colosseum's construction helped to assert that power all the more.\n#AncientRome #TheColosseum #WeirdHistory",

                    "description": "One of the world's most notable feats of architecture is the Colosseum in Rome. Opened in 80 CE by Emperor Titus, this massive structure existed solely to entertain the masses with gladiator fights, animal skirmishes, and, at some point, miniature naval conflicts. While it only took the Romans less than a decade to construct the Colosseum, careful calculation and planning were required. Architects and workers put extensive thought into every detail, from the amphitheater's architectural symmetry to its complex underground maze of corridors and capstans.\n\nFor centuries, we have tried to imagine what occurred in the Colosseum, fleshing out a gory fantasy in film and media. For instance, the movie Gladiator, for all its inaccuracies, attempts to create an image of how Romans lived and fought. What we don't see is the grueling work - typically done by enslaved people - it took to put on one of the Colosseum's gruesome shows. Like sex in Ancient Rome, gladiator fights were about power, both of the Roman empire and of individuals. The complexity and grandiosity of the Colosseum's construction helped to assert that power all the more.\n#AncientRome #TheColosseum #WeirdHistory"

The Nian Rebellion (1851-1869) in the east and north of China had ties to a Buddhist sect, while the Taiping Rebellion in the south was led by a man who claimed to be the recipient of divine revelations. Hong Xiuquan (b. 1814), a schoolteacher from a small village in the Guangzhou province, led the Taiping Rebellion against the Qing Dynasty, nearly toppling the government and establishing himself as ruler.\n\nIn the context of economic strife and religious fervor, Xiuquan blended public need and radical spirituality into an appealing movement for change. Chinese commoners flocked to support Xiuquan, and once he established his Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the country descended into civil strife that altered China's path in immeasurable ways.\n\n\n#QingRebellion #HongXiuquan #WeirdHistory",

The Nian Rebellion (1851-1869) in the east and north of China had ties to a Buddhist sect, while the Taiping Rebellion in the south was led by a man who claimed to be the recipient of divine revelations. Hong Xiuquan (b. 1814), a schoolteacher from a small village in the Guangzhou province, led the Taiping Rebellion against the Qing Dynasty, nearly toppling the government and establishing himself as ruler.\n\nIn the context of economic strife and religious fervor, Xiuquan blended public need and radical spirituality into an appealing movement for change. Chinese commoners flocked to support Xiuquan, and once he established his Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the country descended into civil strife that altered China's path in immeasurable ways.\n\n\n#QingRebellion #HongXiuquan #WeirdHistory"

Napoleon emerged from the French Revolution as a military hero and, during the last decade of the 18th century, seized control of the French government. He consolidated his authority in France while embarking on military campaigns throughout Europe, establishing himself as consul for life in 1802 and emperor two years later. \n\nBy 1812, Napoleon fought against nearly every European country, attempting to take over lands from Britain to Russia. A series of losses, including a failed campaign into Russia, led to his downfall and, when a coalition of Austrian, Prussian, Russian, and Swedish troops marched into Paris in 1814, Napoleon was forced to abdicate. As a condition of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, he went into exile on the Isle of Elba in the Mediterranean. He retreated to the small parcel of land, only to return to Europe in early 1815. \n\n\nNapoleon took power again and began his Hundred Days campaign. As British, Austrian, Russian, and Austrian forces once again came together to stop him, he gathered forces to rebuild his empire. His final campaigns, fought in Belgium, culminated in his defeat at Waterloo on June 18, 1815.\n\n\n#NapoleonBonaparte #BattleOfWaterloo #WeirdHistory",

Though historians have been right to point to a variety of French Revolution causes - ranging from economic and social issues to questions of political representation - it is also true that French royal excess played no small role in driving a wedge between commoners and royals. Considering the decadence, cluelessness, and outrageous choices of the monarchy, it almost seems like the French were begging for revolution.\n\n\n#FrenchRevolution #LouisXVI #WeirdHistory",

Though historians have been right to point to a variety of French Revolution causes - ranging from economic and social issues to questions of political representation - it is also true that French royal excess played no small role in driving a wedge between commoners and royals. Considering the decadence, cluelessness, and outrageous choices of the monarchy, it almost seems like the French were begging for revolution.\n\n\n#FrenchRevolution #LouisXVI #WeirdHistory"

And it was\u2014but it was also the time of the Great Stink, a two-month stretch of 1858 in which London's primary water source, the River Thames, was so full of untreated sewage baking in the sun that the entire city took on an odious reek. The smell was so bad that it was blamed for illnesses among the upper class, reportedly caused citizens miles away to throw up whenever the wind changed, and eventually lead to the development of the London sewage system.\n\n#thegreatstink #victorianera #weirdhistory"

Children with hemophilia often didn't make it to adulthood, since a bump or fall could cause massive internal bleeding. But why was hemophilia known as the royal disease? In the 19th century, royal intermarriage meant Europe's royal families shared a small gene pool. And Queen Victoria, the product of generations of cousin marriages, carried a rare genetic mutation that caused hemophilia. She passed it on to three of her children who went on to marry other royal families and spread the disorder. \n\n\n\n#Hemophilia #TheRoyalDisease #WeirdHistory",

Children with hemophilia often didn't make it to adulthood, since a bump or fall could cause massive internal bleeding. But why was hemophilia known as the royal disease? In the 19th century, royal intermarriage meant Europe's royal families shared a small gene pool. And Queen Victoria, the product of generations of cousin marriages, carried a rare genetic mutation that caused hemophilia. She passed it on to three of her children who went on to marry other royal families and spread the disorder. \n\n\n\n#Hemophilia #TheRoyalDisease #WeirdHistory"

The popularity of the movie has, for decades, spawned all manner of spinoffs, merchandise, and even a creepy Wizard of Oz theme park. \n\nThe kinds of lessons weaved throughout the movie are also present in the original Wizard of Oz books, on which the film is loosely based, but in the original stories, there are so many limbs being lost in any given chapter that the heartfelt message gets a little buried. The original Wizard of Oz stories were told through a series of 14 episodic novels by L. Frank Baum, who wrote them in the early 1900s.\n\n#wizardofoz #bookstomovies #weirdhistory",

The popularity of the movie has, for decades, spawned all manner of spinoffs, merchandise, and even a creepy Wizard of Oz theme park. \n\nThe kinds of lessons weaved throughout the movie are also present in the original Wizard of Oz books, on which the film is loosely based, but in the original stories, there are so many limbs being lost in any given chapter that the heartfelt message gets a little buried. The original Wizard of Oz stories were told through a series of 14 episodic novels by L. Frank Baum, who wrote them in the early 1900s.\n\n#wizardofoz #bookstomovies #weirdhistory"

One of the most important, fascinating, and relatively forgotten pirates was actually a woman, known to history as the so-called \"Pirate Queen.\"\n\n\nThere have been other lady pirates in history, but perhaps none as significant as Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, better known by the Anglicized version of her Irish name, Grace O'Malley. She was born in western Ireland around 1530. Though brought up in a life of relative privilege and wealth, she also faced limitations on her ambitions. The Ireland of her birth was one of eroding independence, as England sought to exert more and more influence over the island to its west.\n\n\n#GraceOMalley #FemalePirates #WeirdHistory",

One of the most important, fascinating, and relatively forgotten pirates was actually a woman, known to history as the so-called \"Pirate Queen.\"\n\n\nThere have been other lady pirates in history, but perhaps none as significant as Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, better known by the Anglicized version of her Irish name, Grace O'Malley. She was born in western Ireland around 1530. Though brought up in a life of relative privilege and wealth, she also faced limitations on her ambitions. The Ireland of her birth was one of eroding independence, as England sought to exert more and more influence over the island to its west.\n\n\n#GraceOMalley #FemalePirates #WeirdHistory"

And she was the mother of one of the most renowned monarchs in British history, Elizabeth I. But there's a lot more to Anne than just her personal affairs, many of which were magnified or inaccurately portrayed by those with a political agenda after her death. So, who was Anne Boleyn really?\n\n\n#AnneBoleyn #BritishHistory #WeirdHistory"

At the time, bacterial diseases like typhoid and dysentery could still wipe out an entire family.\n\nMary Mallon was an Irish immigrant who worked as a cook for affluent New York families. In her wake, she unknowingly left an outburst of typhoid fever, earning her the epithet \"Typhoid Mary.\" By that time, doctors knew the disease was most commonly spread through excrement, and they were able to trace outbreaks by locating the start of an epidemic and following its spread. \n\n\n\n#TyphoidMary #Quarantine #WeirdHistory",

At the time, bacterial diseases like typhoid and dysentery could still wipe out an entire family.\n\nMary Mallon was an Irish immigrant who worked as a cook for affluent New York families. In her wake, she unknowingly left an outburst of typhoid fever, earning her the epithet \"Typhoid Mary.\" By that time, doctors knew the disease was most commonly spread through excrement, and they were able to trace outbreaks by locating the start of an epidemic and following its spread. \n\n\n\n#TyphoidMary #Quarantine #WeirdHistory"

Plus, this was a time when the majority of people were illiterate and highly superstitious, making it that much easier for the church to manipulate the population and make them ever dependent upon the church. \n\n#MedievalChurch #MedievalTimes #WeirdHistory"

                "description": "One of the most interesting misconceptions about the Salem witch trials is that they were the first and only witch hunts that took place. What is significant about the Salem trials is they were some of the last to take place; they came just as the ones in Europe were dwindling - as something that European colonists brought with them to America. Although other trials took place in North America in the 1600s, notably the Connecticut Witch Trials, no witch had been tried and executed since 1663. It was thought to be behind everyone, so when the hysteria in Salem began, it shocked and continues to shock people. As you\u2019ll see in these witch hunt facts, no one was safe - not men, not women, not even the family pet.\n\n#Witchtrial #SalemWitch #WeirdHistory",

                    "description": "One of the most interesting misconceptions about the Salem witch trials is that they were the first and only witch hunts that took place. What is significant about the Salem trials is they were some of the last to take place; they came just as the ones in Europe were dwindling - as something that European colonists brought with them to America. Although other trials took place in North America in the 1600s, notably the Connecticut Witch Trials, no witch had been tried and executed since 1663. It was thought to be behind everyone, so when the hysteria in Salem began, it shocked and continues to shock people. As you\u2019ll see in these witch hunt facts, no one was safe - not men, not women, not even the family pet.\n\n#Witchtrial #SalemWitch #WeirdHistory"

In movies and TV shows, it seems like people enter this program all the time. However, in real life, WITSEC is incredibly selective. Since anonymity is the goal, agents may also tailor protection procedures to be less conspicuous, meaning witnesses likely won't have full a protection detail at all times because it makes them stand out.\n\n#WitnessProtectionProgram #HenryHill #WeirdHistory",

                    "description": "A highly-secretive program, the United States Federal Witness Protection Program protects witnesses before, during, and after a criminal trial. Also called the Witness Security Program (WITSEC), the program is a joint venture of the US Department of Justice and the United States Marshals Service. In movies and TV shows, it seems like people enter this program all the time. However, in real life, WITSEC is incredibly selective. Since anonymity is the goal, agents may also tailor protection procedures to be less conspicuous, meaning witnesses likely won't have full a protection detail at all times because it makes them stand out.\n\n#WitnessProtectionProgram #HenryHill #WeirdHistory"

                "description": "Reservedly advocated as a humane killing device by Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin during the 18th century, the guillotine executed people en masse during the French Revolution; France discontinued its use after 1977. The mechanism of death evoked fear and altered public sentiment about execution. During that time, many viewed capital punishment as a grand, public spectacle, but death by guillotine was a quicker, less-involved process than hanging or traditional beheading at the blade of an ax. \n\nFrench Revolution participants and other crowds who witnessed guillotine executions had mixed reactions to what they saw when the blade fell. Some spectators questioned the so-called painless contraption of death, while others demanded the blood and gore of previous practices. Either way, the guillotine's widespread use became infamous as a historical instrument of allegedly merciful fatality.\n\n#Guillotine #FrenchHistory #WeirdHistory",

                    "description": "Reservedly advocated as a humane killing device by Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin during the 18th century, the guillotine executed people en masse during the French Revolution; France discontinued its use after 1977. The mechanism of death evoked fear and altered public sentiment about execution. During that time, many viewed capital punishment as a grand, public spectacle, but death by guillotine was a quicker, less-involved process than hanging or traditional beheading at the blade of an ax. \n\nFrench Revolution participants and other crowds who witnessed guillotine executions had mixed reactions to what they saw when the blade fell. Some spectators questioned the so-called painless contraption of death, while others demanded the blood and gore of previous practices. Either way, the guillotine's widespread use became infamous as a historical instrument of allegedly merciful fatality.\n\n#Guillotine #FrenchHistory #WeirdHistory"

As the most profound epidemic in human history, the plague claimed the lives of millions, with nearly half of Europe's population perishing from the disease. Some feared they were living through the apocalypse amidst the chaotic upheaval, while others turned to sinful pleasure during the plague to distract from the horror. And as for what happened to victims of the plague, well, it wasn't opportune.\n\nSurviving the Black Death wasn't easy. How did someone protect themselves from it and who did they blame when they got sick? What happened to their body as the infection spread? The only certainty was demise; after all, bubonic plague in the Middle Ages didn't spare anyone: monks and nuns perished alongside mothers and their children, rich men, and even royalty. \n\nHere's how plague victims lived day-to-day.\n\n#blackplague #blackdeath #weirdhistory",

As the most profound epidemic in human history, the plague claimed the lives of millions, with nearly half of Europe's population perishing from the disease. Some feared they were living through the apocalypse amidst the chaotic upheaval, while others turned to sinful pleasure during the plague to distract from the horror. And as for what happened to victims of the plague, well, it wasn't opportune.\n\nSurviving the Black Death wasn't easy. How did someone protect themselves from it and who did they blame when they got sick? What happened to their body as the infection spread? The only certainty was demise; after all, bubonic plague in the Middle Ages didn't spare anyone: monks and nuns perished alongside mothers and their children, rich men, and even royalty. \n\nHere's how plague victims lived day-to-day.\n\n#blackplague #blackdeath #weirdhistory"

Maybe that's why he's referred to by some as \"America's worst 'great' president.\"\n\n#andrewjackson #oldhickory #POTUS"

It was called a lobotomy, an operation that involved inserting a sharp metal instrument through the eye socket of the patient and cutting brain tissue. \n\nBut what does a lobotomy do? The cutting of connective tissue inside the brain was thought to ease the symptoms of mental illness, and was frequently used on patients who were severely depressed or experienced violent outbursts.

In fact, Norris was a bit subpar all throughout his adolescence. Carlos was not athletic, painfully shy, and when it came to his studies, he barely slid by. The fact that his frequently unemployed father was a belligerent alcoholic and his family was always financially scraping by didn't help his depression or debilitating introversion. All that set Norris up for a childhood filled with insecurity and low self-esteem.\n\n#chucknorris #chucknorrisfacts #weirdhistory",

                    "description": "Chuck Norris was born Carlos Ray Norris in southern Oklahoma on March 10th, 1940. Truth be told, he wasn't the extraordinary kid you'd think Chuck Norris would be. In fact, Norris was a bit subpar all throughout his adolescence. Carlos was not athletic, painfully shy, and when it came to his studies, he barely slid by. The fact that his frequently unemployed father was a belligerent alcoholic and his family was always financially scraping by didn't help his depression or debilitating introversion. All that set Norris up for a childhood filled with insecurity and low self-esteem.\n\n#chucknorris #chucknorrisfacts #weirdhistory"

                "description": "Who was Hiroo Onoda? Onoda was a Japanese soldier who refused to surrender long after the capitulation of Japan in WWII. For 29 extra years, Onoda continued to execute the mission that he was ordered to carry out in 1944. Stationed at Lubang Island, in the Philippines, he and his three-man team were the only survivors when the US attacked and recaptured the island in 1945.

For 29 extra years, Onoda continued to execute the mission that he was ordered to carry out in 1944. Stationed at Lubang Island, in the Philippines, he and his three-man team were the only survivors when the US attacked and recaptured the island in 1945. Onoda ordered the group to retreat to remote mountains, occasionally carrying out guerrilla missions against island installations, which was his original assignment. Despite the death or capture of all three of his subordinates, repeated attempts to inform him of the end of the war, and gun battles with Filipino authorities, Onoda fought on. When he was finally tracked down by a Japanese national and told that the war was over, he responded by saying he was continuing to follow orders and would not surrender until he received an appropriate command from his superior officer.\n\n#hirooonoda #worldwarII #weirdhistory"

It began after the stock market crash of October 1929, which sent Wall Street into a panic and wiped out millions of investors.

Futuristic then and nostalgic today, celebrity homes in Palm Springs stand apart from the usual mid-century modern look. These glamorous homes, among the desert landscape, hosted the parties and sordid affairs that defined Palm Springs's legendary golden era."

It tells the story of Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), an autistic savant with extraordinary abilities. But the real life Rain Man, Kim Peek - the man the film was inspired by - was even more incredible. Despite having an IQ that hovered around 87, Peek could read entire books under an hour. His memorization and ability to spout random facts was impressive, so impressive screenwriter Barry Morrow felt compelled to tell his story in the form of Rain Man.",

It tells the story of Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), an autistic savant with extraordinary abilities. But the real life Rain Man, Kim Peek - the man the film was inspired by - was even more incredible. Despite having an IQ that hovered around 87, Peek could read entire books under an hour. His memorization and ability to spout random facts was impressive, so impressive screenwriter Barry Morrow felt compelled to tell his story in the form of Rain Man."

                "description": "Joseph Merrick, aka The Elephant Man, was born on August 5, 1862 in Leicester, England, and he was born a completely healthy child with absolutely no indication that anything was, or would be wrong. There are differing accounts of exactly when Joseph\u2019s disfigurements started to appear, but general consensus is that they didn\u2019t become severe until he was about 5 years old. However he was affected by the disease before his fifth birthday. Accounts state that as early as 21 months, he began developing a swelling of his lips, followed by a bony lump on his forehead, which later grew, of course, to roughly resemble an elephant\u2019s trunk.\n\nMerrick's condition gradually deteriorated during his final years, which were spent at London Hospital. He required a great deal of care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed. His facial deformities continued to grow and his head became more and more dangerously enlarged. He died on  April 11th 1890, at the age of 27. Merrick had to sleep sitting up with his head resting on his knees because of the size of his skull. It\u2019s believed that he died just trying to lay down and go to sleep like everyone else. Treves, who performed the autopsy concluded that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck.\n\nTo this day, Merrick\u2019s exact medical condition remains unknown.",

                    "description": "Joseph Merrick, aka The Elephant Man, was born on August 5, 1862 in Leicester, England, and he was born a completely healthy child with absolutely no indication that anything was, or would be wrong. There are differing accounts of exactly when Joseph\u2019s disfigurements started to appear, but general consensus is that they didn\u2019t become severe until he was about 5 years old. However he was affected by the disease before his fifth birthday. Accounts state that as early as 21 months, he began developing a swelling of his lips, followed by a bony lump on his forehead, which later grew, of course, to roughly resemble an elephant\u2019s trunk.\n\nMerrick's condition gradually deteriorated during his final years, which were spent at London Hospital. He required a great deal of care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed. His facial deformities continued to grow and his head became more and more dangerously enlarged. He died on  April 11th 1890, at the age of 27. Merrick had to sleep sitting up with his head resting on his knees because of the size of his skull. It\u2019s believed that he died just trying to lay down and go to sleep like everyone else. Treves, who performed the autopsy concluded that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck.\n\nTo this day, Merrick\u2019s exact medical condition remains unknown."

                "description": "The Rockefeller family\u2019s industrial and political accomplishments have helped shape America as we know it, and that\u2019s great... but real life isn\u2019t sunshine and rainbows. Here are some surprisingly dark Rockefeller family facts and Rockefeller family history that you probably didn't know:\n\u00a0\n5) A good place to start is William A. Rockefeller, the father of John D. and William Jr.: his sons who would go on to become titans of industry and amass tremendous wealth. William A, however, was a con artist who used to pretend to be deaf and mute while he was working as a traveling salesman\u2026 selling completely useless miracle pills. If pretending to be deaf and mute and selling fake medicine to people isn\u2019t enough for you, he also had a mistress, fathered several illegitimate children, and even pretended to be a doctor named William Livingston. Seems like he could have come up with a better fake name. OR William A. Rockefeller, where the A stands for asshole.\n\u00a0\n4) Nobody wants to be eaten by cannibals, I think, but that might be what happened to Michael Rockefeller - son of former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. Michael was on an anthropological expedition off the coast of New Guinea when his catamaran tipped over. Whoopsie daisy. Anyway, in hopes of making it to shore to get help for his passengers, Rockefeller swam off into the sea and was never seen again. The obvious conclusion is that he drowned, but there were multiple nearby tribes that practiced cannibalism, and in 1969 a Dutch journalist ventured into a remote village to investigate Rockefeller's disappearance and was told that Rockefeller had been killed and eaten. You can\u2019t say for sure that he wasn\u2019t, and neither can I.\n\u00a0\n3) One of the first major tragedies to hit the Rockefeller family came in 1951 when Winifred Emeny - the great niece of John D. Rockefeller - killed her two children before taking her own life. Emeny, who was a hip socialite in the swanky Greenwich, Connecticut scene, started two cars in her garage, put her two young daughters in one of the cars, and laid down between the cars until all three were found dead by the family maid.\n\u00a0\n2) In September of 1913, nearly 11,000 coal miners in Colorado went on strike against the Colorado Fuel & Iron Corporation\u2026 which was owned by the Rockefeller family and Standard Oil. In response to the strike, the workers and their families were evicted from the company-owned housing. However the workers maintained their resolve and set up tent communities nearby to continue the strike. That\u2019s when guards under the employ of John D Rockefeller Sr went in, killed the strike leader, and then began shooting at families fleeing the scene. All told, 19 were killed, including several women and children. John D. Rockefeller, Sr., testified that, even after knowing that guards in his pay had murdered the strikers and their families, he \"would have taken no action\" to prevent the tragedy. That\u2019s ice cold. \u00a0\nOR John D Rockefeller - where the D stands for dick.\n\u00a0\n1) Finally, In 1918, the Rockefeller Foundation helped to create the Eugenic Society of S\u00e3o Paulo, directly financing programs aimed at breeding out the poor and disabled, and making everyone else in Brazil a little more, you know, white. The idea of Social Darwinism was widespread among Brazil's leading scientists, educators, social thinkers, as well as many elected officials and the Rockefeller Foundation played a huge role in implementing what was called the \u201cpublic health movement\u201d in Brazil, which, again, was selective breeding to make everyone white. Literally to, and I quote \"to sanitize is to eugenize\"",

                    "title": "The Dark History Of The Rockefeller Family Exposed",
                    "description": "The Rockefeller family\u2019s industrial and political accomplishments have helped shape America as we know it, and that\u2019s great... but real life isn\u2019t sunshine and rainbows. Here are some surprisingly dark Rockefeller family facts and Rockefeller family history that you probably didn't know:\n\u00a0\n5) A good place to start is William A. Rockefeller, the father of John D. and William Jr.: his sons who would go on to become titans of industry and amass tremendous wealth. William A, however, was a con artist who used to pretend to be deaf and mute while he was working as a traveling salesman\u2026 selling completely useless miracle pills. If pretending to be deaf and mute and selling fake medicine to people isn\u2019t enough for you, he also had a mistress, fathered several illegitimate children, and even pretended to be a doctor named William Livingston. Seems like he could have come up with a better fake name. OR William A. Rockefeller, where the A stands for asshole.\n\u00a0\n4) Nobody wants to be eaten by cannibals, I think, but that might be what happened to Michael Rockefeller - son of former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. Michael was on an anthropological expedition off the coast of New Guinea when his catamaran tipped over. Whoopsie daisy. Anyway, in hopes of making it to shore to get help for his passengers, Rockefeller swam off into the sea and was never seen again. The obvious conclusion is that he drowned, but there were multiple nearby tribes that practiced cannibalism, and in 1969 a Dutch journalist ventured into a remote village to investigate Rockefeller's disappearance and was told that Rockefeller had been killed and eaten. You can\u2019t say for sure that he wasn\u2019t, and neither can I.\n\u00a0\n3) One of the first major tragedies to hit the Rockefeller family came in 1951 when Winifred Emeny - the great niece of John D. Rockefeller - killed her two children before taking her own life. Emeny, who was a hip socialite in the swanky Greenwich, Connecticut scene, started two cars in her garage, put her two young daughters in one of the cars, and laid down between the cars until all three were found dead by the family maid.\n\u00a0\n2) In September of 1913, nearly 11,000 coal miners in Colorado went on strike against the Colorado Fuel & Iron Corporation\u2026 which was owned by the Rockefeller family and Standard Oil. In response to the strike, the workers and their families were evicted from the company-owned housing. However the workers maintained their resolve and set up tent communities nearby to continue the strike. That\u2019s when guards under the employ of John D Rockefeller Sr went in, killed the strike leader, and then began shooting at families fleeing the scene. All told, 19 were killed, including several women and children. John D. Rockefeller, Sr., testified that, even after knowing that guards in his pay had murdered the strikers and their families, he \"would have taken no action\" to prevent the tragedy. That\u2019s ice cold. \u00a0\nOR John D Rockefeller - where the D stands for dick.\n\u00a0\n1) Finally, In 1918, the Rockefeller Foundation helped to create the Eugenic Society of S\u00e3o Paulo, directly financing programs aimed at breeding out the poor and disabled, and making everyone else in Brazil a little more, you know, white. The idea of Social Darwinism was widespread among Brazil's leading scientists, educators, social thinkers, as well as many elected officials and the Rockefeller Foundation played a huge role in implementing what was called the \u201cpublic health movement\u201d in Brazil, which, again, was selective breeding to make everyone white. Literally to, and I quote \"to sanitize is to eugenize\""

                "description": "Even though we get a World War II movie EVERY year... there are still some stories yet to be told, and many are Unsolved Nazi mysteries and conspiracies! \n\nWhether it be Hitler hiding the Spear of Destiny in Antarctica or Heinrich Himmler possibly having a hand in Otto Rahn\u2019s death. There are many Nazi mysteries that are still unsolved to this day.\n\nThese WWII mysteries include the death of Gestapo Heinrich Muller, the Nazi ghost train, Hitler\u2019s possession of the spear of destiny, the death of Otto Rahn, and the whereabouts of the pistol for Hitler\u2019s suicide. \n\n5) What happened to Heinrich Muller?\n\nWhat happened to Heinrich M\u00fcller? A senior Nazi Gestapo official, M\u00fcller played a big role as an intermediary between Extermination Camp bigwigs Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Eichmann. He attended the infamous Wannsee Conference where the Final Solution was formally implemented, and personally supervised the arrests and interrogations of the suspects involved in the July 20th 1944 plot to kill Hitler. His last sighting was in a bunker on May 1st, 1945, a day after Hitler\u2019s suicide. He remains the most senior Nazi Official whose fate is unknown. Some theories include suicide or that he was killed during the fall of Berlin\u2026 he escaped to South America\u2026 or he was given a new identity by the US or Soviet Union and worked incognito during the cold war. We may never know.\n\n4) The Spear of Destiny\n\nThe spear of destiny, used by the Roman Longinus to stab Jesus Christ during his crucifixion\u2026 was believed to imbue whoever its current owner was with the power to rule the world. You see where this is going\u2026 yep, Hitler had it. Hitler first saw the spear in 1912 at Hofburg Palace in Vienna when he was an art student, he fell in love, he needed it, so he took it when he annexed Austria in 1938. The spear was recovered by American troops in 1946\u2026 but some folks, including Dr. Howard Buechner\u2026 a Doctor\u2026 suggest that spear was a fake and the real one was shipped off to a secret Nazi base in Antarctica...where it\u2019s guarded by top men...top men.\n\n3) Who took Hitler\u2019s suicide pistol?\n\nIf secret Nazi bases in Antarctica aren\u2019t doin\u2019 it for you\u2026 who took the pistol Hitler used to commit suicide? After Hitler blew his brains out with his dead girlfriend next to him, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, picked up Hitler's pistol from the floor and placed it on the table. That\u2019s where Artur Axmann, the head of the Hitler Youth claims to have retrieved it and commented that he would \"hide it for better times.\" Better times? For what...Cyborg Hitler? Anyways, Axmann claimed to to have buried the pistol in a Berlin park. But, when he returned years later, he couldn't find it. Maybe he should have checked Antarctica.\n\n2) Is there a Nazi Ghost Train?\n\nWe can\u2019t do an unsolved mysteries video without a ghost train, so here we are. It\u2019s rumored that in the final days of the war in Poland, local German officials near Wroclaw, filled an armored train with jewels, artwork, and all kinds of valuables, and headed toward secret tunnels in the Owl mountains. But somewhere along the way the train disappeared. It\u2019s rumored to be sealed in a mountain tunnel, but no one knows where. Locals have hunted the Ghost Train for many years to no avail\u2026 until 2015 when treasure hunters Piotr Koper and Andreas Richter claimed that they saw the train in Wa\u0142brzych, Poland. They began a massive digging project to find the train in 2016\u2026 but came up empty\u2026. Aside from Wa\u0142brzych tourism rising 44%. To me it\u2019s obvious where the train is: Antarctica.\n\n1) The mysterious death of Otto Rahn\n\nFinally, the mysterious death of Otto Rahn, a writer, researcher, and MOST importantly... the inspiration for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rahn was convinced that the Holy Grail was somewhere in the ruins of the fortress of Montsegur in the south of France. His work on the subject caught the eye of Heinrich Himmler who agreed to sponsor Otto. Unfortunately, Rahn never found the Grail despite expeditions to Iceland, France, Spain and NOT Antarctica. Otto Rahn's frozen body was found in the Austrian Tyrol in March 1939. His death was officially ruled a suicide but his relationship with Himmler and the fact that Otto Rahn was openly homosexual rightfully opened up the door to suspecting a bit of foul play.",
