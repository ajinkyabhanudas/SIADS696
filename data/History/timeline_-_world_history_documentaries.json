The story of a duel between two chess giants, fighting a personal war in a world gone to ruin. This battle of black and white was more than a face-off over a chessboard. Part psychological drama, part political thriller, the film brings to life their hostilities, nested like Russian dolls. Karpov vs. Kasparov represents the battle between the faltering empire and the young liberals several steps ahead of the game, checkmating the old guard. Or how two stories \u2013 the societal one and the personal one \u2013 started out separately and ended up superimposed, twining together into one tale.\n\nIt's like Netflix for history...

The story of a duel between two chess giants, fighting a personal war in a world gone to ruin. This battle of black and white was more than a face-off over a chessboard. Part psychological drama, part political thriller, the film brings to life their hostilities, nested like Russian dolls. Karpov vs. Kasparov represents the battle between the faltering empire and the young liberals several steps ahead of the game, checkmating the old guard. Or how two stories \u2013 the societal one and the personal one \u2013 started out separately and ended up superimposed, twining together into one tale.\n\nIt's like Netflix for history...

After the war, Lischka settles in Cologne thanks to a legal loop-hole protecting Nazis like him from prosecution. That is, until one morning when Nazi hunters Serge and Beate Klarsfeld show up. Determined to bring Lischka and others like him to justice, they hope the footage of a Nazi criminal running through the streets of Cologne will shame Germany into adopting a new law. \n\nIt's like Netflix for history...

                "description": "Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was not always in a state of political strife. In 1885 the British army invaded Burma and deposed its King. He died in exile, ending a thousand years of monarchy. The royal family vanished, and the country was plunged into war and the longest military dictatorship of modern times.

In 2001, CNN and Time Magazine named Ben Carson one of the nation's 20 foremost physicians and scientists. His mother was his most influential inspiration, changing Ben from worst to first. He gained respect as he soared to the top of his class. He applied himself, stayed focused on achievement, studied hard and graduated from Yale with a degree in psychology; where he met his future wife, mother of his children and life partner, Candy.\n\nCarson earned his M.D. at the University of Michigan Medical School and later at the age of 33, was appointed the Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the youngest person ever to hold that position. He was the first brain surgeon to successfully separate twins conjoined at the back of the head. Ben Carson has been granted 67 honorary doctorate degrees and the United States' highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His beliefs are integral to his achievements. Ben Carson's story is an amazing inspiration. It will continue, not only because of what he has achieved, but because his final chapters are yet to be written.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

                    "description": "How does an inner city African American kid with a self-proclaimed violent temper, become a world renowned brain surgeon, an inspiring role model for disadvantaged youth, a medical innovator and achieve success... against all odds? In 2001, CNN and Time Magazine named Ben Carson one of the nation's 20 foremost physicians and scientists. His mother was his most influential inspiration, changing Ben from worst to first. He gained respect as he soared to the top of his class. He applied himself, stayed focused on achievement, studied hard and graduated from Yale with a degree in psychology; where he met his future wife, mother of his children and life partner, Candy.\n\nCarson earned his M.D. at the University of Michigan Medical School and later at the age of 33, was appointed the Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the youngest person ever to hold that position. He was the first brain surgeon to successfully separate twins conjoined at the back of the head. Ben Carson has been granted 67 honorary doctorate degrees and the United States' highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His beliefs are integral to his achievements. Ben Carson's story is an amazing inspiration. It will continue, not only because of what he has achieved, but because his final chapters are yet to be written.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

In the face of the Protestant Reformation, a fanatical monk sets out to exterminate the heresy. On his path to power he will create the Roman Inquisition. And he will become the most hated Pope in history. Powerful leaders of the Catholic Church are arrested and imprisoned, accused of reading books banned by the Church. Free-thinking students are silenced. Darkness descends on the centers of learning and Renaissance.

The decadence of a Medici Pope in Rome outrages the devout priest in Germany named Martin Luther. In the face of the Protestant Reformation, a fanatical monk sets out to exterminate the heresy. On his path to power he will create the Roman Inquisition. And he will become the most hated Pope in history. Powerful leaders of the Catholic Church are arrested and imprisoned, accused of reading books banned by the Church. Free-thinking students are silenced. Darkness descends on the centers of learning and Renaissance. The Roman Inquisition leaves a legacy that lasts into the twentieth century.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

As Spitfires and Hurricanes undergo servicing and maintenance, the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber of the Flight is stripped back to its skin for a major overhaul. We follow the work involved as these aircraft are reinstated in the markings and colour schemes of machines flown by courageous and outstanding aircrew of World War II. Exclusive interviews with personnel of the Memorial Flight reveal the passion and enthusiasm that lies behind the expertise of those who maintain and fly these magnificent aircraft. Pilots who have previously flown the latest jet fighters describe the excitement and techniques of flying these classic warplanes, especially the huge Lancaster bomber. And in stark contrast, interviews with veteran aircrew of Fighter and Bomber Command, provide a chilling reminder of the reality of operational flying in hostile skies. Dramatic archive footage from WWII illustrates differences and similarities with the flight of today, while new material, shot with the full cooperation of the Memorial Flight, on the ground and in the air, allows us to participate in the Flight\u2019s preparations for the display at Biggin Hill and the display itself.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

                    "description": "Check out our show Real Fake History's episode on the Battle Of Britain! \ud83d\udc49 https://youtu.be/OaH2-g04cIA\n\nThe Last Of The Few takes a detailed look at the Battle Of Britain Memorial Flight as it prepares for its 50th year of display & commemorative flying with a thrilling display at the Biggin Hill International Air Show in 2007. As Spitfires and Hurricanes undergo servicing and maintenance, the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber of the Flight is stripped back to its skin for a major overhaul. We follow the work involved as these aircraft are reinstated in the markings and colour schemes of machines flown by courageous and outstanding aircrew of World War II. Exclusive interviews with personnel of the Memorial Flight reveal the passion and enthusiasm that lies behind the expertise of those who maintain and fly these magnificent aircraft. Pilots who have previously flown the latest jet fighters describe the excitement and techniques of flying these classic warplanes, especially the huge Lancaster bomber. And in stark contrast, interviews with veteran aircrew of Fighter and Bomber Command, provide a chilling reminder of the reality of operational flying in hostile skies. Dramatic archive footage from WWII illustrates differences and similarities with the flight of today, while new material, shot with the full cooperation of the Memorial Flight, on the ground and in the air, allows us to participate in the Flight\u2019s preparations for the display at Biggin Hill and the display itself.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

But now, extraordinary new discoveries are revealing a very different picture of her reign.\n\nAs archaeologists investigate hidden tombs, spectacular pagodas, gigantic palaces and priceless treasures from her time, they are uncovering a very different story of China\u2019s female Emperor, her skills and her empire. Wu Zetian\u2019s China was a military, economic and cultural superpower, whose influence stretched from the edge of the Mediterranean to Japan and India.  Recent discoveries reveal the wealth and stability of her reign, and point to her skills as a politician and a leader. But they also provide tantalising new evidence of the cruelty and violence at the heart of her regime.\n\nWith hands-on investigations and access to the treasures of Wu Zetian\u2019s time, this film tries to give a definitive answer to the question: was Emperor Wu an evil tyrant or one of the most successful rulers in all Chinese history?\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

But now, extraordinary new discoveries are revealing a very different picture of her reign.\n\nAs archaeologists investigate hidden tombs, spectacular pagodas, gigantic palaces and priceless treasures from her time, they are uncovering a very different story of China\u2019s female Emperor, her skills and her empire. Wu Zetian\u2019s China was a military, economic and cultural superpower, whose influence stretched from the edge of the Mediterranean to Japan and India.  Recent discoveries reveal the wealth and stability of her reign, and point to her skills as a politician and a leader. But they also provide tantalising new evidence of the cruelty and violence at the heart of her regime.\n\nWith hands-on investigations and access to the treasures of Wu Zetian\u2019s time, this film tries to give a definitive answer to the question: was Emperor Wu an evil tyrant or one of the most successful rulers in all Chinese history?\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

But this was a mummy with a difference: it was far older than any comparable examples found in Egypt.\n\nThe culture that produced the mummy were cattle herders, and occupied much of North Africa, at a time when the Sahara was a savannah. Possible links with later Egyptian culture have also been found, including the representation in rock art of dog-headed human figures (resembling Anubis), and a type of pottery decoration later found in the southern Nile valley.\n\nThe mummy of a young boy, Uan Muhuggiag was destined for controversy. He was older than any comparable Egyptian mummy and his mere existence challenged the very idea that Egyptians were the first in the region to mummify their dead. Uan Muhuggiag was no one off. The sophistication of his mummification suggested he was the result of a long tradition of mummification.\n\nThe discovery raised some profound questions. Who were the ancient inhabitants of the Sahara Desert who put the mummy there? And what influence might those people have had on the glittering civilization that later emerged in the land of the pharaohs?\n\nThis fascinating film follows Italian professor Savino di Lernia and his colleagues on a trek through the Sahara in the search for answers \u2014 a journey that leads to some astounding conclusions.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.\n\nIn this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u2019s original holy city \u2013 as detailed in the Qur\u2019an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u2019s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u2018forbidden gathering place\u2019. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.\n\nIn the film \u2018The Sacred City\u2019 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u2013 while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.\n\nWhile clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u2019s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u2019an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.\n\nIn a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.\n\nBeautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

The very word invokes an epic tale of Pharaohs and Israelites, plagues and miracles, the splitting of the sea, the drowning of an army, Moses and revelation. The story is at the very heart of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. \n\nAfter six years of research, working with archeologists, Egyptologists, geologists and theologians, Simcha Jacobovici came to the groundbreaking conclusion that the Exodus took place hundreds of years earlier than previously thought. With this new timetable in hand, Jacobovici and his colleagues re-examined long ignored archeological artifacts and uncovered the truth about the Exodus and the Egyptian dynasty that ruled at the time. \n\nThe producers teamed up with some of the world\u2019s most accomplished special effects designers to create a unique digital, organic experience of the Exodus. Blending archeological findings with modern eye catching effects, Jacobovici built a virtual museum to showcase his discoveries.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

The very word invokes an epic tale of Pharaohs and Israelites, plagues and miracles, the splitting of the sea, the drowning of an army, Moses and revelation. The story is at the very heart of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. \n\nAfter six years of research, working with archeologists, Egyptologists, geologists and theologians, Simcha Jacobovici came to the groundbreaking conclusion that the Exodus took place hundreds of years earlier than previously thought. With this new timetable in hand, Jacobovici and his colleagues re-examined long ignored archeological artifacts and uncovered the truth about the Exodus and the Egyptian dynasty that ruled at the time. \n\nThe producers teamed up with some of the world\u2019s most accomplished special effects designers to create a unique digital, organic experience of the Exodus. Blending archeological findings with modern eye catching effects, Jacobovici built a virtual museum to showcase his discoveries.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

November 11th proved to be a doomed peace, a prelude to a century-long struggle for mastery of Europe. David Reynolds argues that it was the frenetic politicking and brutality of the fighting in 1918 that sowed the seeds of the even bloodier Second World War just 20 years later.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

                    "description": "A fresh look at the Armistice of 1918\n\nProfessor David Reynolds uncovers a story of wounded egos, political scheming and strategy behind the lines as statesmen and generals haggled over the terms of peace, while the soldiers fought on the front-line.\n\nIn a journey that takes him through command centers and battlefields, he explores why half-a-million men were killed or wounded in the bitter endgame of the \u2018Great War\u2019 and unravels how Germany ultimately plunged to total defeat. November 11th proved to be a doomed peace, a prelude to a century-long struggle for mastery of Europe. David Reynolds argues that it was the frenetic politicking and brutality of the fighting in 1918 that sowed the seeds of the even bloodier Second World War just 20 years later.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

Sean\u2019s journey of discovery is inspired by his own experiences of playing Napoleonic soldier Richard Sharpe in TV films based on Bernard Cornwell\u2019s best-selling novels. In the programmes he draws on the eye-witness accounts of soldiers who fought at Waterloo to tell the story of the dramatic events of 18 June 1815 as they were experienced by the ordinary soldiers who fought it. He pieces together the chronology of the battle and visits some of the legendary places where the outcome was decided, including the buildings at Hougoumont which witnessed some of the heaviest fighting. He also meets descendants of some of the soldiers who fought at Waterloo, to discover how they remember the achievements of their ancestors. \n\nTo bring their stories to life he works alongside present-day soldiers from the British army and experts in military history and stages hands-on experiments that bring him closer to the reality of fighting at Waterloo. At the Royal Armouries in Leeds he fires an original Waterloo musket, loaded with live ammunition, and takes part in an experiment to test the damage caused by original Waterloo cavalry swords. He works with re-enactors from the Napoleonic Association to find out more about the infantry and artillery tactics used in the battle. He also witnesses the damage caused by an original Waterloo cannon using live ammunition. \n\nIn Belgium he meets the archaeologist responsible for the unique discovery of the skeleton of a Waterloo soldier who died during the battle and whose remains lay undiscovered on the battlefield for almost 200 years, in the exact spot where the soldier died.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

                "description": "Simon Reeve follows in the footsteps of thousands of travellers from previous centuries, as he travels from northern France to northern Spain, and then crosses western Europe to arrive in Rome.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, pilgrimage shaped much of Europe, as inns and churches sprung up along routes and villages near popular shrines developed into towns. To see how this is still happening, Simon visits a route that has come back to life. The Camino is a 500-mile trek starting in a bustling French town before it climbs over the Pyrenees and winds through northern Spain to Santiago de Compostela. Along the way, he visits a church with a bizarre display of live chickens, experiences the kindness of volunteers who run hostels and meets pilgrims from around the world who are walking for a variety of reasons. At the end of the route, he joins the crowds at the pilgrims' mass as one of the biggest incense burners in the world swings over his head.\n\nIn Switzerland, Simon undertakes one of the oldest and most perilous pilgrim routes in Europe. The Great St Bernard Pass, high in the Alps, has claimed many lives over the centuries, including at least one Pope. Simon treks to a monastery and refuge at the top of the pass that has not closed its doors to visitors for 1000 years. He meets some young Americans there and joins in their yoga class, hears their stories, and helps them to clean the monastery.\n\nTo see how modern pilgrimage melds into tourism, Simon goes to the shrine devoted to the monk Padre Pio who died in 1968 in San Giovanni Rotondo in the east of Italy. Padre Pio's fame spread globally and the economic impact on the town has been huge. Simon sees the shrine made from melted down gold jewellery donated by pilgrims, meets the monk who runs the Padre Pio TV station, and discovers that many modern pilgrims rather like staying in fancy hotels.\n\nFinally, Simon arrives in Rome and St Peter's Square when pilgrims gather in their thousands to be blessed by the Pope. He reflects on his realisation that for those who follow a pilgrim's path, it is more about what they discover on the way than reaching journey's end.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

This golden age was threatened by the growing power of Karnak's priests, and Joann reveals how Tutankhamen's early death was a chance for Egypt to start afresh and rewrite history, but was undermined by decades of state-sanctioned looting of the tombs.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

After digging stone out of the quarry, they take it to the tracing floor, where every stone is marked out using the most closely guarded knowledge of the medieval castle builders: geometry. Then each step is hand-carved, a three-day task, before being winched into place using the treadmill-powered crane.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

After digging stone out of the quarry, they take it to the tracing floor, where every stone is marked out using the most closely guarded knowledge of the medieval castle builders: geometry. Then each step is hand-carved, a three-day task, before being winched into place using the treadmill-powered crane.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

'My Mother Diana' looks at how Diana\u2019s life, her relationship with the House of Windsor, the media and the public have shaped her eldest son, Prince William. When a twenty year-old Lady Diana Spencer married Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, their wedding at St Paul\u2019s was watched by billions; it was the last great royal wedding to galvanise the British public. But that relationship would develop into a romantic tragedy, whose effects would be more profound than anyone could have imagined. In his marriage to Kate Middleton, Prince William is entering into a new and independent stage of his life\u2026a life in which his mothers influence and presence appear centre-stage and ever-present.. It is easy to forget that William\u2019s formative years were not the idyll with the \u2019Princess of People\u2019s Hearts\u2019\u2026rather they took place in the midst of a vicious divorce battle.

It explores the effect of his mother\u2019s relationships, the tell-all book she collaborated on with Andrew Morton, the effects of her Panorama interview and William's reaction to his father\u2019s relationship with Camilla. On the surface William appears to be a product of the old order, groomed by the House of Windsor. But William is the son of Diana \u2013 who transcended celebrity and transformed the monarchy. This film seeks to understand William by exploring his relationship with his mother and examines where William was as key moments of her later life played out; because what she went through made him who he is today Why did William propose using his mother\u2019s engagement ring? And what does it tell us about this future King and the legacy of his mother Diana? Fourteen years after her death Diana\u2019s influence appears undiminished.

Electricity, refrigeration and a whole host of different materials promised to make life at home brighter, easier and more convenient.

The scientist who discovered the tree gave it the name Methuselah. It was a seedling when the Egyptian pyramids were being built and a mature tree at the time of Christ. It is now over 4,000 years old.

The documentary focuses on exploring the unknown story of Hitler's family and the dramatic fates of those related to the most hated man in history.\n\nIt also explores the genetic history of Eva Braun to determine if Hitler and his wife had any Jewish ancestries, and it establishes the claims that Hitler\u2019s relatives hold to his remaining assets. The film introduces Hitler's living relatives including cousins in Austria, grand-nephews in Germany and New York and his in-laws, including Eva Braun's close cousin, her two sisters and the fates of their respective families and heritage.\n\nBetrayal, murder, conspiracy, physical deformity, incestuous love and robbery are all part of the ongoing tale of the exceptionally dysfunctional Hitler family.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

The documentary focuses on exploring the unknown story of Hitler's family and the dramatic fates of those related to the most hated man in history.\n\nIt also explores the genetic history of Eva Braun to determine if Hitler and his wife had any Jewish ancestries, and it establishes the claims that Hitler\u2019s relatives hold to his remaining assets. The film introduces Hitler's living relatives including cousins in Austria, grand-nephews in Germany and New York and his in-laws, including Eva Braun's close cousin, her two sisters and the fates of their respective families and heritage.\n\nBetrayal, murder, conspiracy, physical deformity, incestuous love and robbery are all part of the ongoing tale of the exceptionally dysfunctional Hitler family.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

                "description": "The Spartans chronicles the rise and fall of one of the most extreme civilisations the world has ever witnessed. A civilization that was founded on discipline, sacrifice and frugality where the onus was on the collective and the goal was to create the perfect state, and the perfect warrior.  Classical historian Bettany Hughes reveals the secrets and complexities of everyday Spartan life: homosexuality was compulsory, money was outlawed, equality was enforced, weak boys were put to death and women enjoyed a level of social and sexual freedom that was unheard of in the ancient world. It was a nation of fearsome fighters where a glorious death was treasured. This can be aptly demonstrated by the kamikaze last stand at Thermopylae, where King Leonidas and his warriors fought with swords, hands and teeth to fend off the Persian invaders and show the rest of the world what it meant to be Spartan.    Programme two explores the bitter rivalry between Sparta and Athens and their startlingly different views of women. They were two cities with totally opposed views of the 'good life'. For Athens, Sparta was a frightening place that turned its children into fighting machines. But worse still were Sparta's women: liberated, independent, opinionated, they took an active part in sport, raced horses and chariots, celebrated nudity and wielded power in the absence of their men. They were an affront to Athenian notions of femininity. When war between Sparta and Athens finally came, it raged for decades and split the Greek world. Until, on the island of Sphacteria, the reputation of Sparta's famed warriors for fearlessness was shockingly undermined. It cannot lay claim to the philosophers or artists of Athens but Sparta contributed as much to western civilisation as Athens did. Indeed it was Sparta, not Athens that was the first city to offer citizenship to its inhabitants. To many, the ideals formed 2500 years ago in Sparta can be seen as a fore-runner of modern-day totalitarianism.  By setting out to create a perfect society protected by perfect warriors, Sparta made an enemy of change. A collapsing birth-rate, too few warriors, rebellious slaves, and outdated attitudes to weaponry and warfare combined to sow the seeds of Sparta's destruction. Eventually the once great warrior state was reduced to a stop for Roman tourists who came to view the bizarre sado-masochistic rituals.

This can be aptly demonstrated by the kamikaze last stand at Thermopylae, where King Leonidas and his warriors fought with swords, hands and teeth to fend off the Persian invaders and show the rest of the world what it meant to be Spartan.    Sparta was ruthlessly militaristic and founded on a belief that good order and justice protected against chaos and lawlessness. Policed by secret spies the society was supported by a nation of slaves so all Spartan men had to do was fight. Boys were indoctrinated with the Spartan code of death and glory, separated from their mothers at seven and left to fend for themselves. It led Aristotle to comment that Sparta \"turned its children into animals.\" The training continued throughout adolescence, the most able boys being let loose as death squads preying on the slave population to keep them quiet.

                    "title": "The Life Of An Ancient Spartan | The Spartans | Timeline",
                    "description": "The Spartans chronicles the rise and fall of one of the most extreme civilisations the world has ever witnessed. A civilization that was founded on discipline, sacrifice and frugality where the onus was on the collective and the goal was to create the perfect state, and the perfect warrior.  Classical historian Bettany Hughes reveals the secrets and complexities of everyday Spartan life: homosexuality was compulsory, money was outlawed, equality was enforced, weak boys were put to death and women enjoyed a level of social and sexual freedom that was unheard of in the ancient world. It was a nation of fearsome fighters where a glorious death was treasured. This can be aptly demonstrated by the kamikaze last stand at Thermopylae, where King Leonidas and his warriors fought with swords, hands and teeth to fend off the Persian invaders and show the rest of the world what it meant to be Spartan.    Sparta was ruthlessly militaristic and founded on a belief that good order and justice protected against chaos and lawlessness. Policed by secret spies the society was supported by a nation of slaves so all Spartan men had to do was fight. Boys were indoctrinated with the Spartan code of death and glory, separated from their mothers at seven and left to fend for themselves. It led Aristotle to comment that Sparta \"turned its children into animals.\" The training continued throughout adolescence, the most able boys being let loose as death squads preying on the slave population to keep them quiet.  It cannot lay claim to the philosophers or artists of Athens but Sparta contributed as much to western civilisation as Athens did. Indeed it was Sparta, not Athens that was the first city to offer citizenship to its inhabitants. To many, the ideals formed 2500 years ago in Sparta can be seen as a fore-runner of modern-day totalitarianism.  By setting out to create a perfect society protected by perfect warriors, Sparta made an enemy of change. A collapsing birth-rate, too few warriors, rebellious slaves, and outdated attitudes to weaponry and warfare combined to sow the seeds of Sparta's destruction. Eventually the once great warrior state was reduced to a stop for Roman tourists who came to view the bizarre sado-masochistic rituals.

                "description": "Prince Charles Edward was Queen Victoria\u2019s favourite grandson. In 1900, the sixteen-year-old Prince was the only viable British contender for the hugely wealthy Dukedom of Saxe Coburg and Gotha in Germany. Ordered to go by Queen Victoria, he took the title and was transformed from a British Prince into a German Duke \u2013 Herzog Carl Eduard. The course of his life was altered in ways neither he nor Queen Victoria could have ever imagined.\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Prince Charles Edward had no option but to fight for Germany against the country of his birth. When the War ended, he was stripped of his British titles, and an Act of Parliament branded him a Traitor Peer. Disillusioned and depressed, Charles Edward became an enthusiastic supporter of Adolf Hitler\u2019s National Socialist Workers\u2019 Party, and unwittingly helped him in his rise to power. Appointing him President of the Anglo German Fellowship, Hitler offered Charles Edward a way to return to Britain with his head held high. \n\nCharles Edward was also President of the German Red Cross, and it was this that would ultimately embroil him in the darkest aspects of the Nazi regime, implicating him in the T4 Euthanasia Programme. At the end of the Second World War, he was arrested by the Americans, held in a series of harsh internment camps and forced to undergo a humiliating trial where, despite his claims he had no knowledge of the crimes of the regime, he was adjudged to have been an important Nazi and was almost bankrupted by heavy fines. He died in poverty and obscurity in Germany in 1954. His sister Princess Alice, who had stayed in England, became one of the most popular members of the Royal Family and a favourite aunt of Queen Elizabeth II. She was the living embodiment of the life her brother could have had, if it had not been for Queen Victoria\u2019s fateful decision fifty years earlier.

Up till now, Britain\u2019s place in the history of slavery has been as the country that abolished the international slave trade.\n\nBritain\u2019s Slave Trade reveals the shameful truth behind this liberal facade, showing how the economic, social and cultural life of Britain would have been unrecognisable without slavery.

Up till now, Britain\u2019s place in the history of slavery has been as the country that abolished the international slave trade.\n\nBritain\u2019s Slave Trade reveals the shameful truth behind this liberal facade, showing how the economic, social and cultural life of Britain would have been unrecognisable without slavery.
