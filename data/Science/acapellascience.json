If you'd like to book me for something, email acapellascience@gmail.com\nSupport me on Patreon! http://patreon.com/acapellascience\n\nYou can find the original video for this song on here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNJE6t6fZE\n\nFollow Jason @SingingChemist\n\nThis clip is taken from a 1.5-hour show/public talk I gave at the University of British Columbia entitled \"This Is Not A Lecture\". It was my first full-length show and an amazing experience. We sang, we laughed, we looped.. we talked about the sleeping dragon of the scientific unknown, the inherent goofiness of physics, strange acronyms from CMB to AdS/CFT. On-stage reunions of old a capella group-mates and TV co-stars were had. We plumbed my catalogue of harmonious science, from the first \"dun dun duns\" of \"Rolling in the Higgs\" to my upcoming dinosaurian bird ballad. We sang of times entropic, gravities bohemian, neutrinos massive and microwaves cosmic. I wanna do it again.\n\nA CAPELLA SCIENCE STUFF:\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/acapellascience\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/acapellascience\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/acapellascience\nBohemian Gravity poster: https://store.dftba.com/products/bohe...\nMP3: http://timblais.bandcamp.com\n\nFollow me @acapellascience on Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat!",

If you'd like to book me for something, email acapellascience@gmail.com\nSupport me on Patreon! http://patreon.com/acapellascience\n\nYou can find the original video for this song on here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNJE6t6fZE\n\nFollow Jason @SingingChemist\n\nThis clip is taken from a 1.5-hour show/public talk I gave at the University of British Columbia entitled \"This Is Not A Lecture\". It was my first full-length show and an amazing experience. We sang, we laughed, we looped.. we talked about the sleeping dragon of the scientific unknown, the inherent goofiness of physics, strange acronyms from CMB to AdS/CFT. On-stage reunions of old a capella group-mates and TV co-stars were had. We plumbed my catalogue of harmonious science, from the first \"dun dun duns\" of \"Rolling in the Higgs\" to my upcoming dinosaurian bird ballad. We sang of times entropic, gravities bohemian, neutrinos massive and microwaves cosmic. I wanna do it again.\n\nA CAPELLA SCIENCE STUFF:\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/acapellascience\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/acapellascience\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/acapellascience\nBohemian Gravity poster: https://store.dftba.com/products/bohe...\nMP3: http://timblais.bandcamp.com\n\nFollow me @acapellascience on Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat!"

Whether you're curious about my scientific and musical inspirations (Bill Nye ftw), or what my favourite formula is (Euler's formula, but that's not what I said), or what I think scientists should do about President Trump (Martian colony anyone?), or how I achieved my enviable 4-ish octave vocal range (trickery and deception) it's all here! And if I didn't answer the question you wanted answered... well, let's get this channel to 70,000 and I'll do another one!\n\nNew here? Go to http://youtube.com/acapellascience and subscribe!"
