Capillary action carries liquids against an opposite force such as gravity and the colors travel up with it in the diffusion principle. Make your own cool pattern and try this awesome and cool science experiment. It's art and science combined.\nIn the density tower I layered water then syrup (the syrup is heavier more dense than the water so the syrup stays on the bottom. Then I add colored lamp oil. The colored lamp oil is least dense so it floats on top.I then drop a nut bold screw in and it's the heaviest (most dense) of everything so it sinks to the bottom. Next up is the grape. It's heavier than the water but not heavier than the syrup so it floats on top of the syrup but on bottom of the water. Next comes the soda cap. It's heavier than the oil but not heavier than the water so it floats on top of the water but UNDER the oil. Last but not least, the ping pong is least dense of them all and so it floats on top.

With additive color mixing you don't lose any wavelengths and when all the colors combine you see white but in subtractive color mixing such as in colored water and paint it's called subtractive because you're losing colored wavelengths and therefore you'll end up seeing just dark brown or black. I also do gyroscope experiments in this video and more so enjoy today's science class! :) Big news about a live science show on ZOOM with prizes and more coming up soon!! STAY TUNED!",

It's additive and subtractive color mixing and the results are really cool and interesting. With additive color mixing you don't lose any wavelengths and when all the colors combine you see white but in subtractive color mixing such as in colored water and paint it's called subtractive because you're losing colored wavelengths and therefore you'll end up seeing just dark brown or black. I also do gyroscope experiments in this video and more so enjoy today's science class! :) Big news about a live science show on ZOOM with prizes and more coming up soon!! STAY TUNED!"

I used the waterproof spray on sand and it blocked out all water AND oils. Oil is what germs live on so if the oil can't attach to anything then the virus can't attach to anything either. I used regular craft sand since the beach sand probably has a lot more junk in it and isn't as pure and fine. It was tons of fun to play with the magic waterproof sand. The water repels off it like magic. Makes an awesome craft and DIY activity. Have fun stay safe subscribe and STAY INCREDIBLE!!!",

                    "description": "Welcome to our new online science class. Today I'm going to show you some science experiments all focused on the coronavirus. The coronavirus lives in germs which are encased in fatty layers. Soap breaks down this fatty layer and the virus cannot live without it since it has nothing to hold on to. I do the pepper and water science experiment and also the milk food coloring and water science experiment. Stay tuned to the next video for even more coronavirus COVID19 experiments! Comment below and let me know what science experiments you want to see next! Stay Incredible!"

I'll show you how to make really cool colorful tornado vortexes or whirpools while keeping the waer clear! All you need is a bottle, a tornado connector, clear lamp oil and some food coloring and oil coloring...or you can just buy colored lamp oil. When you spin the bottle the water forms a vortex in the bottle. To see it better use colored lamp oil together with water and the water and tornado will be 2 different colors! When you use just regular food coloring to color the tornado the whole vortex will be one color. But if you add lamp oil coloring then the tornado will be one color and the water will be clear! So cool!",

I'll show you how to make really cool colorful tornado vortexes or whirpools while keeping the waer clear! All you need is a bottle, a tornado connector, clear lamp oil and some food coloring and oil coloring...or you can just buy colored lamp oil. When you spin the bottle the water forms a vortex in the bottle. To see it better use colored lamp oil together with water and the water and tornado will be 2 different colors! When you use just regular food coloring to color the tornado the whole vortex will be one color. But if you add lamp oil coloring then the tornado will be one color and the water will be clear! So cool!"

I bought the lifestraw because I wanted to test and see if we can use the power of science to make ocean water water drinkable. I used the life straw and put dirty muddy water in it to see if I can get clear safe drinkable water from it. If the life straw can make the ocean drinkable it would be an amazing survival straw. The lifstraw is great for camping backpacking and overal water filtering, but can it filter the ocean? I then tested Pepsi soda, coconut water, beer and mouthwash with the life straw to see if I can get the drinkable water from it! I then cracked open the lifestraw to see how the lifestraw filters the bad dirt and bacteria from the water. I opened it up and we were able to see exactly how the lifestraw filters the water! But CAN we make the ocean drinkable?!?!? Watch and find out! Let me know if there's any other liquid you want me to try with the lifestraw!!

                    "description": "CAN YOU ACTUALLY DRINK WATER FROM THE OCEAN? I bought the lifestraw because I wanted to test and see if we can use the power of science to make ocean water water drinkable. I used the life straw and put dirty muddy water in it to see if I can get clear safe drinkable water from it. If the life straw can make the ocean drinkable it would be an amazing survival straw. The lifstraw is great for camping backpacking and overal water filtering, but can it filter the ocean? I then tested Pepsi soda, coconut water, beer and mouthwash with the life straw to see if I can get the drinkable water from it! I then cracked open the lifestraw to see how the lifestraw filters the bad dirt and bacteria from the water. I opened it up and we were able to see exactly how the lifestraw filters the water! But CAN we make the ocean drinkable?!?!? Watch and find out! Let me know if there's any other liquid you want me to try with the lifestraw!! THANKS AND STAY INCREDIBLE!!!\n\nMore Beach Science Videos! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9yg9axXkCR_1F9tS5dN4CzjenPxMfek7"

All you need to start your fire is a giant water ball also known as water balz and some tinder. The water ball is just like a magnifying glass and uses the sun to create the flame. I used clear water balls which is basically a giant orbeez to create my fire. I used the water ball like a giant magnifying glass and it worked the same way and it ignited into flames! I couldn't believe we actually started the fire with the water ball! I also used the water ball and the sun to light matches and pop some balloons! harness the power of nature to create your own fire! So cool and  hope you enjoyed!

I went to an awesome zoo to see the lions and I brought some blood with me to a zoo called Turtleback zoo in New Jersey to see some lions and to test if they would react to blood! I took CJ and the family and we saw tons of other wild animals such as bison, tigers, sharks and grizzly bears. I wanted to test and see if Lion's can smell the blood from far away and to see if they would be attracted to the blood and possible come towards me! I did the science experiment with some other items such a bloody stuffed teddy bear and even poured blood on my hand! Don't worry it's not real blood but it looks exactly like it!

                    "description": "Do you think a lion will attack if it smells blood?! I went to an awesome zoo to see the lions and I brought some blood with me to a zoo called Turtleback zoo in New Jersey to see some lions and to test if they would react to blood! I took CJ and the family and we saw tons of other wild animals such as bison, tigers, sharks and grizzly bears. I wanted to test and see if Lion's can smell the blood from far away and to see if they would be attracted to the blood and possible come towards me! I did the science experiment with some other items such a bloody stuffed teddy bear and even poured blood on my hand! Don't worry it's not real blood but it looks exactly like it!

I bought a large industrial fan and a lot of dry ice and flipped the fan upside so that the suction will pull the \"smoke\" carbon dioxide upwards and create a vortex! \nGuva Juice tried to make an indoor tornado and Steve Spanger did it as well as a random college class made whats probably the world's largest indoor tornado!

I did the density tower, the milk and food coloring experiment, the magic skewer and balloon science trick dancing raisins and more! I even made slime!I bought all the products after the video and I filmed and actually DID all the science experiments IN target! I've done mane of these experiments but I didn't know what target would have and what experiments I'd be able to do there. I took an Uber to Target and grabbed a shopping cart did some research and loaded up my cart! I'm surprised no one stopped me while I was doing the experiments but I guess it was a busy day or maybe they just didn't care as long as I didn't steal the items...Which I didn't...So anyways it was cool and fun to do this science experiment challenge in Target. Comment and let me know which place I should go to next and do this Science Experiment challenge! Peace and Stay Incredible! SUBSCRIBE!!!",

I did the density tower, the milk and food coloring experiment, the magic skewer and balloon science trick dancing raisins and more! I even made slime!I bought all the products after the video and I filmed and actually DID all the science experiments IN target! I've done mane of these experiments but I didn't know what target would have and what experiments I'd be able to do there. I took an Uber to Target and grabbed a shopping cart did some research and loaded up my cart! I'm surprised no one stopped me while I was doing the experiments but I guess it was a busy day or maybe they just didn't care as long as I didn't steal the items...Which I didn't...So anyways it was cool and fun to do this science experiment challenge in Target. Comment and let me know which place I should go to next and do this Science Experiment challenge! Peace and Stay Incredible! SUBSCRIBE!!!"

In this family friendly video you'll see many incredible / satisfying /amazing science toys / physics toys. \n\nScience Toys In This Video:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Zero Blaster: Introducing the NEW Amazing Zero Toys Smoke-Ring Blaster! Now with 7 different sound effects, enhanced vapor production, new ring controls and a sleek new design! These brand new Zero Blasters are definitely an upgraded version of the previous Zero Blaster we all came to know and love. Each Zero Blaster comes with a 3 ounce bottle of Super Zero Fog Fluid (safe non-toxic water based fluid) which can produce up to 20,000 rings!!! Blast 2-4 inch diameter vapor rings up to 12 feet as many times as your heart desires. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Gyroscope: Produced since 1917, the gyroscope has been a classic educational toy for generations. It continues to fascinate young and old alike with its mysterious force that seems to defy gravity. An excellent tool to teach gyroscopic inertia, the gyroscope will provide hours of creative play. Gyroscope technology is used in numerous applications of everyday life such as guidance and navigation systems in ships, planes and spacecrafts; in accurate mapping and survey work; in oil drilling and even motion picture making. \n\nIn random order....\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Scrib: Let\u2019s get creative in Free Style play. Users take Scrib\u2019s magic marker to plain white paper and challenge Scrib to conquer hand drawn mazes, navigate homespun maps, or travel across super highways made by connecting multiple sheets of paper. Children will learn S.T.E.A.M principals while they have fun.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hand Boiler: A hand boiler or (less commonly) love meter is a glass sculpture used as an experimental tool to demonstrate vapor-liquid equilibrium, or as a collector's item to whimsically \"measure love.\" It consists of a lower bulb containing a volatile liquid and a mixture of gases that is connected usually by a twisting glass tube that connects to an upper or \"receiving\" glass bulb.\n\n\ud83d\udc49Micro Bank: Coin shrinks to a mere fraction of its original size as it passes through the funnel and drops into the tiny chamber below. You can see just how small the coin has become through the box's window.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Virtual Illusion Puzzle: Each puzzle sheet is printed with a slice of a 3-dimensional image. The trick is to arrange all 12 sheets in the correct order. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Helicone: Magical transformations. Inspired by nature, based on the Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Angle, helicone not only represents beautiful botanical structures but also provides stunning transformations before your very eyes.\nWatch it magically transform between a helix and a pine cone with a simple, quick twist.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Feel Flux: The Feel Flux Skill Set demonstrates a fascinating principle of physics while entertaining your mind and challenging your abilities, all at once. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Giant Squid Eggs/ Water Balz: Have a ball with this fun polymer science experiment! Watch in amazement as your polymer balls which starts out smaller than a small marble grows to the size of a racquetball when placed in water-all in a day or two! Comes in an array of vibrant colors that hold true, even when hydrated. They roll, and even though they do not bounce, they will explode when thrown or dropped! Drop the balls in water and imagine the endless possibilities as they grow before your eyes!\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\nIncredible Science\n\nAmazing Science Toys\n\nScience Toys Compilation\n\nThe Most Satisfying Video in the World\n________________________________________________",

I had a cement truck come and fill in the sidewalk with cement and I added orbeez which are polymer balls that grow hundreds of times in size because they absorb so much water. I also filled up my own containers with cement and added my own wet cement. It dried and made such cool sculptures!! Like and Subscribe!"

Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE!!!!\n\nFULL FIRE EXPERIMENTS PLAYLIST: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9yg9axXkCR__Wn_ZQOYN-0xd5M5em5LF\n\nToday I'll show you how you can make fire using just one piece of gum and a double AA battery. I saw this incredible science experiment on the King of Randoms channel. The gum wrapper that I used is 5 Five gum and you specifically need the gum wrapper to have a metallic coating on it so that it can conduct the electricity from the battery. The back of the wrapper has paper on it so that catches fire. It's a cool life science hack but you have to make sure to cut the gum wrapper perfectly. If you cut the gum wrapper too thin or too thick and the wrapper won't catch on fire. \n\nSUBSCRIBE SUBCRIBE SUBSCRIBE!",

Ever wanted to become invisible? Now you can with this incredible Lubor's Lens optical illusion card! The Lubor's Lens is a magic science trick that just makes certain objects disappear!! It's truly amazing! I placed a pen on my hand not expecting anything to happen but then I placed the card over my hand and it amazingly made the pen disappear but I saw my hand!! I couldn't believe what I saw. I then had CJ try it and he took the Lubor's Lens in his hand and we did the same pen trick and it disappeared from his hand too!!\nI tried making other objects disappear such as beads and putty and toy cars. We were able to get the putty to have the same disappearing effect my shaping the Crazy Aaron's putty into a pen. So we figured out that the shape of the object really affects the disappearing effect. Anyways, it was super cool and just so amazing to see.

                "description": "See Gyroscope Tricks and Physics Stunts ~ Incredible Science here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9zhP9Bnx-k\n\nHi guys! I challenged my wife to a gyroscope tricks and physics stunts showdown using 2 types of gyroscopes. We used the same gyroscope that I used in my 13 million view gyroscope tricks and physics stunts video including the epic box spin gyroscope trick. I also used an easier to use gyroscope that just needed a stick to spin the gyroscope. The first gyroscope challenge was just to see how long we can get the gyroscope to spin for. The second challenge was to see how long we can balance the gyroscope on our hand. The third challenge was to see how many times we can throw it back and forth and the fifth challenge was to see how many times the spinning gyroscope can be tossed back and forth between hands. Mrs. Incredible also came up with an awesome challenge of her own even though it was a prank challenge but she said why not try and balance the gyroscope on top of a $100 dollar bill!! Watch what happens!! She did a good job considering it was her first time using a gyroscope and she even won the first challenge. We challenged each other to spinning the gyroscope to time tests and stunts such as balancing the gyroscope on a string. Mrs. Incredible or \"wife\" as she likes to be called in the videos wants to challenge me to something else for $10,000 so comment and let me know what the next challenge should be.SUBSCRIBE and STAY INCREDIBLE!!!\n\nFull Gyroscope Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9yg9axXkCR9Ag26WTPaw74UnrRQH6HA2",

I challenged my wife to a gyroscope tricks and physics stunts showdown using 2 types of gyroscopes. We used the same gyroscope that I used in my 13 million view gyroscope tricks and physics stunts video including the epic box spin gyroscope trick. I also used an easier to use gyroscope that just needed a stick to spin the gyroscope. The first gyroscope challenge was just to see how long we can get the gyroscope to spin for. The second challenge was to see how long we can balance the gyroscope on our hand. The third challenge was to see how many times we can throw it back and forth and the fifth challenge was to see how many times the spinning gyroscope can be tossed back and forth between hands. Mrs. Incredible also came up with an awesome challenge of her own even though it was a prank challenge but she said why not try and balance the gyroscope on top of a $100 dollar bill!! Watch what happens!! She did a good job considering it was her first time using a gyroscope and she even won the first challenge. We challenged each other to spinning the gyroscope to time tests and stunts such as balancing the gyroscope on a string. Mrs. Incredible or \"wife\" as she likes to be called in the videos wants to challenge me to something else for $10,000 so comment and let me know what the next challenge should be.SUBSCRIBE and STAY INCREDIBLE!!!\n\nFull Gyroscope Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9yg9axXkCR9Ag26WTPaw74UnrRQH6HA2"

I found an awesome and easy way to make this really cool pencil resin ball and you don't need any fancy machines to get the cool resin ball that you see at the end. All you need is Resin, colored pencils, a mold and that's it!\n1) Warm the resin and mold by placing the bottles in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes\n2) mix equal parts resin and hardener\n3) Stir SOLWLY until the mixture is clear and without swirls\n4) Pour resin and fill up the mold a little less than halfway\n5) wait a few minutes until the resin STARTS to harden then place the pencils in the sticky semi hard resin\n6) fill up the rest of the mold with resin and let dry overnight!\n\nThose are the steps you need to make your own resin pencil ball! I even show you how to make a galaxy resin ball! If you want me to slam this resin pencil ball or a galaxy resin ball with a baseball bat just leave a like and a comment thanks!

                "description": "I WENT TO TOY FAIR 2019 and found some truly INCREDIBLE new toys! From Crazy Aaron's actual Moon Putty to the $125,000 Tangle sculpture the annual New York Toy Fair 2019 was alot of fun! Whether you like fun Rc Cars or Squishy Orbeez toys or Giant KNEX roller coasters and ferris wheels, the Toy Fair didn't disappoint. One of the coolest exhibits was the mindscope booth where they had the awesome Twister Tube racing tube and cars.

From Crazy Aaron's actual Moon Putty to the $125,000 Tangle sculpture the annual New York Toy Fair 2019 was alot of fun! Whether you like fun Rc Cars or Squishy Orbeez toys or Giant KNEX roller coasters and ferris wheels, the Toy Fair didn't disappoint. One of the coolest exhibits was the mindscope booth where they had the awesome Twister Tube racing tube and cars.

                    "description": "I took a gyroscope 19 floors up close to 300 feet high in the Atlantis hotels in the Bahamas and did some epic gyroscope tricks and physics stunts! The tedco gyroscope balanced on my hand and it was able tp spin on a string and on a sand castle. I did some other cool physics stunts at the beach and from a crazy height! I took it down to the beach and had fun with the gyroscope. I you have any ideas you want to see me do with the gyroscope just comment below.\n\nProduced since 1917, the gyroscope has been a classic educational toy for generations. It continues to fascinate young and old alike with its mysterious force that seems to defy gravity. It can even dance on a tightrope or balance on the lip of a glass. Discover the secret and make your gyroscope do these and other astounding tricks. This is an excellent tool to teach gyroscopic inertia and teaches a physical principle of the conservation of angular momentum. Gyroscope technology is used in numerous applications of everyday life such as in bicycles, levitating tops, satellites and navigation systems of airplanes and space shuttles. Amaze your friends with this incredible and Original Tedco Gyroscope!\nIncredible Science Fun Learning Ideas:"

I will show you how to take from 1 to 10 hex nuts and have them float above a ring. \nPablo Cimadevila did a beautiful video that showed how to turn I TURN 2 HEX NUTS into a 1 Ct DIAMOND RING but this experiment is known as the hex nut into ring science experiment. It's inertia and gravity all combining  to make for an unreal floating science experiment. When you balance the hex nuts on top of the ring and then pull from INSIDE the ring, the hex nuts will float for a second then fall straight into the bottle. If you push from OUTSIDE the ring the hex nut will go flying. The reason this incredible science experiment works when you pull from INSIDE the ring is because the ring goes DOWN slightly when you push from inside. When you hit the ring from the outside the ring pushes UP slightly and the hex nut goes flying. Try it yourself it's  alot of fun and the science is truly incredible.",

All you need to make this at home is a mason jar some water and dish soap and some glitter or colorful beads. \n\nIt's easy to create the spinning vortex of water or any other liquid. You can also add food coloring to give it an awesome look! I used clear dishwashing liquid but you can use any color. The cyclone tube or tornado in a bottle is done by adding water and leaving approximately 1 inch of space on top. Add 1 tablespoon of dishwashing liquid and add any glitter or food coloring or beads that you want. Then give it a good spin for about 5 seconds around and around and watch the tornado cyclone form!!!

I found some interesting science facts about the chemical reaction that occurs when you tie dye a shirt! I also linked that below. SO you now have everything you need to ACE that science fair project and have fun making tie dye shirts at the same time!\n\nScience behind Tie Dye Projects\nhttps://stemjobs.com/how-does-tie-dye-work/"

I'll give you the step by step way how to make this incredible tornado in your own home! BE CAREFUL! I created a fire tornado using a metal can a turntable and some cotton balls a metal garbage can with holes on the side and lighter fluid! A fire tornado is created when a fire is caught up in a spinning column of air! It's super dangerous weather phenomenon but you can carefully and safely recreate this awesome and incredible science experiment in your own home! \nJUST BE CAREFUL!! It's real fire and can hurt or kill someone!! Just put the cotton balls (about 5 balls) in the metal container and place that container down in the garbage can. Place the garbage can on a spinning dolly or turntable. Make sure it's a metal garbage can so the air can come in through the sides! A tornado obviously needs spinning air to form!\nPour some lighter fluid in and light it up and give a slow spin! Make sure the metal container is in MIDDLE of the garbage can or it won't work!! Stand back after you spin it and watch the fire tornado spring to  life! Have a fire extinguisher on hand just in case!!

I took 2 bottles of diet coke and mentos and went to times square in NYC. I got permission to launch the soda and mentos smack in middle of times square. I think it's the first time ever that soda and mentos were launched in times square NYC!

                "description": "In todays Incredible Science experiment I threw dry ice into the Atlantic Ocean! I've seen dry ice thrown into pools and dry ice bombs thrown into lakes but I always wondered if throwing dry ice into an ocean would create a giant cloud. I've seen dry ice bubbles and dry ice thrown into lakes and creeks and sinks but I've never seen dry ice thrown into the ocean. So I drove the the Atlantic ocean and bought some dry ice along the way. There was an old abandoned walkway that led me down to the ocean. I took the dry ice out one by one and threw them all into the ocean! I was amazed to see that it made dry ice clouds even down deep in the ocean! Someone called the cops because they showed up but it was fine they were just patrolling the area and I was already out of the ocean. It was a truly amazing dry ice experiment! Comment and let me know what you want me to do with dry ice next! First comment on the video gets a Stay Incredible Cap!

                    "description": "In todays Incredible Science experiment I threw dry ice into the Atlantic Ocean! I've seen dry ice thrown into pools and dry ice bombs thrown into lakes but I always wondered if throwing dry ice into an ocean would create a giant cloud. I've seen dry ice bubbles and dry ice thrown into lakes and creeks and sinks but I've never seen dry ice thrown into the ocean. So I drove the the Atlantic ocean and bought some dry ice along the way. There was an old abandoned walkway that led me down to the ocean. I took the dry ice out one by one and threw them all into the ocean! I was amazed to see that it made dry ice clouds even down deep in the ocean! Someone called the cops because they showed up but it was fine they were just patrolling the area and I was already out of the ocean. It was a truly amazing dry ice experiment! Comment and let me know what you want me to do with dry ice next! First comment on the video gets a Stay Incredible Cap!

I used rubber bands and put a ton of them around the water melon and it really just exploded! There was watermelon everywhere! I saw the exploding watermelon experiment using rubber bands on other youtube videos but I thought it would be cool to try it on a baby watermelon and see if it works as well. It was awesome!

The action lab did a floating water video like this but I wanted to show it to you using more colors and do a bigger water floating version with 4th of July colors!   I also go HUGE at the end so watch till the end and also watch to see how you could win! If you want to see more science experiments with water check out my playlist I'll put the link below...! It's an incredible science experiment but you really need to be careful so that you don't burn your hands like I did. It's really cool to see the different colored water stay afloat on other water! It's really water floating on water! The secret is the top water is warm and hot while the bottom is cold! If you mix cold and cold water the colors mix instantly.

The action lab did a floating water video like this but I wanted to show it to you using more colors and do a bigger water floating version with 4th of July colors!   I also go HUGE at the end so watch till the end and also watch to see how you could win! If you want to see more science experiments with water check out my playlist I'll put the link below...! It's an incredible science experiment but you really need to be careful so that you don't burn your hands like I did. It's really cool to see the different colored water stay afloat on other water! It's really water floating on water! The secret is the top water is warm and hot while the bottom is cold! If you mix cold and cold water the colors mix instantly. If the hot water is on bottom then it will also mix since the cold water is more dense or heavier than the warm water. But if you put the warm hot water on top it will appear to FLAT!!

                "description": "Are you ready for the most epic rocket mod? Here at Incredible Science I've been doing tons of soda and mentos rocket launches and other epic soda and mentos videos like the giant soda and mentos bottle eruption and the giant mentos and soda balloon video, but this soda and mentos rocket is different because I think I've finally mastered it. I'll show you how to launch a soda bottle over a house. You can use any soda for the soda rocket mod but I've found the diet coca cola works the best. You'll need mentos and soda for the rocket mod. Use tape to lower the mentos in while holding it up with the soda cap, then quickly close the soda bottle cap. When you slam the soda on the ground open the cap first so some soda starts to come out and then hit the bottle on the ground so that the cap hits the ground. It SHOULD take off. Be CAREFUL as this soda mod goes really fast so wear eye and face protection to be safe. I hope you enjoyed this soda rocket mod!! \n\nCheck out my full Mentos and Soda epic video playlist!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI6JA0j7Low&list=PL9yg9axXkCR-e6-2CYDi2XYoOYvijnXx-\n\n\nStay Tuned and don't forget to subscribe!

I'll show you how to launch a soda bottle over a house. You can use any soda for the soda rocket mod but I've found the diet coca cola works the best. You'll need mentos and soda for the rocket mod. Use tape to lower the mentos in while holding it up with the soda cap, then quickly close the soda bottle cap. When you slam the soda on the ground open the cap first so some soda starts to come out and then hit the bottle on the ground so that the cap hits the ground. It SHOULD take off. Be CAREFUL as this soda mod goes really fast so wear eye and face protection to be safe. I hope you enjoyed this soda rocket mod!! \n\nCheck out my full Mentos and Soda epic video playlist!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI6JA0j7Low&list=PL9yg9axXkCR-e6-2CYDi2XYoOYvijnXx-\n\n\nStay Tuned and don't forget to subscribe!

You can do some really cool things with it such as pop balloons with the laser, light mathes and the blue beam can be seen for supposedly 9 miles away! This laser also comes with some really col attachments to make start patterns. I will be doing a full video on this but need to send me camera to be fixed so will have to wait a bit for it...\n\nDon't forget to subscribe and turn on notifications!

You can do some really cool things with it such as pop balloons with the laser, light mathes and the blue beam can be seen for supposedly 9 miles away! This laser also comes with some really col attachments to make start patterns. I will be doing a full video on this but need to send me camera to be fixed so will have to wait a bit for it...\n\nDon't forget to subscribe and turn on notifications!

                "channelId": "UCJcycnanWtyOGcz34jUlYZA",
                "description": "How to make a mirror silvering solution from silver nitrate, ammonia, sugar and sodium hydroxide.\n\nGlass surfaces can be given coatings of silver that make them into mirrors.\n\nWARNING: Perform the whole experiment in less than two hours. This is because the solution generates extremely dangerous/explosive silver nitride on standing. Also, the solution will give off ammonia when heated so you'll need to do this outside, in a fume hood or in a well-ventilated area. And wash away all chemicals with lots of water.\n\nTo do this, you first need the silver nitrate we made in a previous video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6hPgG...\n\nGet one gram of silver nitrate and one gram of sodium hydroxide. Then add enough water to both to completely dissolve them. Mix them together and you'll get a black precipitate of silver oxide. Then add enough ammonia to completely dissolve the silver oxide. Add four grams of sugar and mix well.\n\nThe solution will deposit silver coatings when its heated. If you heat it in a glass container it will deposit silver on the inside of the container. To deposit it onto a glass pane you can put the glass into a tray with solution and heat the tray from below. But do not let the solution boil. Boiling tears the silver off the surface.\n\nThin layers of silver can be wiped off with a cloth if the silver goes where you don't want it. Thicker layers can be removed by applying hydrochloric acid.\n\nThis process produces a back reflective mirror, which is what most household mirrors are.\n\nFor more information on the chemistry: Google \"Tollens Reagent\". This reaction is used in chemistry to test for aldehyde groups.",

                    "description": "How to make a mirror silvering solution from silver nitrate, ammonia, sugar and sodium hydroxide.\n\nGlass surfaces can be given coatings of silver that make them into mirrors.\n\nWARNING: Perform the whole experiment in less than two hours. This is because the solution generates extremely dangerous/explosive silver nitride on standing. Also, the solution will give off ammonia when heated so you'll need to do this outside, in a fume hood or in a well-ventilated area. And wash away all chemicals with lots of water.\n\nTo do this, you first need the silver nitrate we made in a previous video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6hPgG...\n\nGet one gram of silver nitrate and one gram of sodium hydroxide. Then add enough water to both to completely dissolve them. Mix them together and you'll get a black precipitate of silver oxide. Then add enough ammonia to completely dissolve the silver oxide. Add four grams of sugar and mix well.\n\nThe solution will deposit silver coatings when its heated. If you heat it in a glass container it will deposit silver on the inside of the container. To deposit it onto a glass pane you can put the glass into a tray with solution and heat the tray from below. But do not let the solution boil. Boiling tears the silver off the surface.\n\nThin layers of silver can be wiped off with a cloth if the silver goes where you don't want it. Thicker layers can be removed by applying hydrochloric acid.\n\nThis process produces a back reflective mirror, which is what most household mirrors are.\n\nFor more information on the chemistry: Google \"Tollens Reagent\". This reaction is used in chemistry to test for aldehyde groups."

                "description": "Here's how to make your own DIY Batman Gallium FIdget Spinner! This is by far the easiest way to make spinners because you don't need a mold or clay or anything other than the plastic container that your batman spinner or any other fidget spinner came in. Just Pour your gallium into the plastic shaped mold and there you go! Your Gallium Hand Spinner will be ready in 30 minutes (place in freezer) Have fun making this batman spinner or any other edc spinner that you want! Here's the giveaway link!...\n\nCONTEST:  https://gleam.io/h4uhr/700000-subscriber-giveaway\n\nI made a Fidget Spinner out of Gallium Liquid metal. I then used spray paint to make the spinner into a rainbow color! I used a Plasticine mold to cast a home made fidget spinner toy but when it wasn't working too well I just made it by hand and made a cool spinner design!\n\nHere's the FIRST EVER GALLIUM SPINNER VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=hSVOcbCGG4I\n\nIn the video titled MAKING A GALLIUM FIDGET SPINNER I actually make an incredible gallium edc hand spinner that spins and melts and actually is just like a real handspinner! in this DIY How to Video I'll show you how to make a fidget spinner and turn it into a rainbow color spinner. \n\nGallium is a non toxic material commonly found and it has the amazing property of being a solid at Room temperature but when it gets heated above 30 degrees celsius it actually melts! I used a mold to make my gallium spinner and it came out amazing! The spinner works like a regular spinner and even melts in the palm of my hand!\n\nIt was so cool getting the fidget spinner to work. I'm always looking for more ideas and for awesome spinners and for cool fidget spinner video ideas..If you have an idea comment below using #Fidgetspinner and if I use your idea I'll shout you out in the video.\n\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to the VLOG channel for FREE STAY INCREDIBLE Merch!!

                    "description": "Here's how to make your own DIY Batman Gallium FIdget Spinner!

Just Pour your gallium into the plastic shaped mold and there you go! Your Gallium Hand Spinner will be ready in 30 minutes (place in freezer) Have fun making this batman spinner or any other edc spinner that you want! Here's the giveaway link!...\n\nCONTEST:  https://gleam.io/h4uhr/700000-subscriber-giveaway\n\nI made a Fidget Spinner out of Gallium Liquid metal. I then used spray paint to make the spinner into a rainbow color! I used a Plasticine mold to cast a home made fidget spinner toy but when it wasn't working too well I just made it by hand and made a cool spinner design!\n\nHere's the FIRST EVER GALLIUM SPINNER VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=hSVOcbCGG4I\n\nIn the video titled MAKING A GALLIUM FIDGET SPINNER I actually make an incredible gallium edc hand spinner that spins and melts and actually is just like a real handspinner! in this DIY How to Video I'll show you how to make a fidget spinner and turn it into a rainbow color spinner. \n\nGallium is a non toxic material commonly found and it has the amazing property of being a solid at Room temperature but when it gets heated above 30 degrees celsius it actually melts! I used a mold to make my gallium spinner and it came out amazing! The spinner works like a regular spinner and even melts in the palm of my hand!\n\nIt was so cool getting the fidget spinner to work.

                    "description": "How to make a Rainbow Fidget Spinner is the first video in the world that shows how to actually make gallium into a colorful metal fidget spinner!\n\nI made a Fidget Spinner out of Gallium Liquid metal. I then used spray paint to make the spinner into a rainbow color! I used a Plasticine mold to cast a home made fidget spinner toy but when it wasn't working too well I just made it by hand and made a cool spinner design!\n\nHere's the FIRST EVER GALLIUM SPINNER VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=hSVOcbCGG4I\n\nIn the video titled MAKING A GALLIUM FIDGET SPINNER I actually make an incredible gallium edc hand spinner that spins and melts and actually is just like a real handspinner! in this DIY How to Video I'll show you how to make a fidget spinner and turn it into a rainbow color spinner. \n\nGallium is a non toxic material commonly found and it has the amazing property of being a solid at Room temperature but when it gets heated above 30 degrees celsius it actually melts! I used a mold to make my gallium spinner and it came out amazing! The spinner works like a regular spinner and even melts in the palm of my hand!\n\nIt was so cool getting the fidget spinner to work. I'm always looking for more ideas and for awesome spinners and for cool fidget spinner video ideas..If you have an idea comment below using #Fidgetspinner and if I use your idea I'll shout you out in the video.\n\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to the VLOG channel for FREE STAY INCREDIBLE Merch!!

                    "description": "Have you ever seen fidget spinners made out of gallium? In this video titled MAKING A GALLIUM FIDGET SPINNER I actually make an incredible gallium edc hand spinner that spins and melts and actually is just like a real handspinner! in this DIY How to Video I'll show you how to make a fidget spinner. Gallium is a non toxic material commonly found and it has the amazing property of being a solid at Room temperature but when it gets heated above 30 degrees celsius it actually melts! I used a mold to make my gallium spinner and it came out amazing! The spinner works like a regular spinner and even melts in the palm of my hand!\n\nIt was so cool getting the fidget spinner to work. I'm always looking for more ideas and for awesome spinners and for cool fidget spinner video ideas..If you have an idea comment below using #Fidgetspinner and if I use your idea I'll shout you out in the video.\n\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to the VLOG channel for FREE STAY INCREDIBLE Merch!!

                    "description": "I'll show you how to spin a 1000 MPH Fidget Spinner WITHOUT an AIr Compressor! These EDC fidget spinner tricks are simple and make for awesome experiments! I've seen fidget spinners used with air compressors and there  are so many fidget spinners videos out there. From fidget spinner diy to Stephen Sharers epic spinner mods TO FUNK BROS AWESOME FIDGET SPINNER VIDEOS....There's even a spinner video using a spinner on a truck and on a lamborghini and there are tons of epic spinner tricks videos...I also do giveaways every day for spinners and more!\nBut for all the fidget spinner videos that get to 1000 MPH they all use air compressors. So I decided to show you guys who don't have an air compressor other ways to get it to spin fast! I haven't seen anyone make hand spinners go this fast without an electric air compressor so give this video a thumbs up! Enjoy getting your fidget spinner to boost it's speed!

The rolls of candies were threaded onto a pipe cleaner and dropped into the soft drink to create a geyser. At the end of the 1990s the manufacturer of Wintergreen Lifesavers increased the size of the mints and they no longer fit in the mouth of soda bottles. Science teachers found that Mint Mentos candies had the same effect when dropped into a bottle of any carbonated soft drink.\n\nLee Marek and \"Marek's Kid Scientists\" performed the Diet Coke and Mentos experiment on the Late Show with David Letterman in 1999. In March 2002, Steve Spangler, a science educator, did the demonstration on KUSA-TV, an NBC affiliate, in Denver, Colorado. The Mentos Geyser Experiment became an internet sensation in September 2005. The experiment became a subject of the television show Mythbusters in 2006.Spangler signed a licensing agreement with Perfetti Van Melle, the maker of Mentos, after inventing an apparatus aimed to make it easier to drop the Mentos into the bottle and produce a large soda geyser.Amazing Toys, Spangler's toy company, released the Geyser Tube toys in February 2007. In October 2010, a Guinness World Record of 2,865 simultaneous geysers was set at an event organized by Perfetti Van Melle at the SM Mall of Asia Complex, in Manila, Philippines.This record was afterwards beaten in November 2014 by another event organized by Perfetti Van Melle and Chupa Chups in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico where 4,334 Mentos and soda fountains were set off simultaneously.\n\nThe eruption is caused by a physical reaction, rather than any chemical reaction. The addition of the Mentos leads to the rapid nucleation of carbon dioxide gas bubbles precipitating out of solution.Gasses, in general, are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures. Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure. The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened, and the pressure is released. \n\nThe nucleation reaction can start with any heterogeneous surface, such as rock salt, but Mentos have been found to work better than most. Tonya Coffey, a physicist at Appalachian State University, found that the aspartame in diet drinks lowers the surface tension in the water and causes a bigger reaction, but that caffeine does not accelerate the process. The geyser reaction will still work even using sugared drinks, but diet is commonly used both for the sake of a larger geyser as well as to avoid having to clean up a sugary soda mess.\n\nWe post a new videos often and a new video EVERY day on the vlog channel! so, if you liked this video and want more like this then SUBSCRIBE and COMMENT on what you want to see next!\n\nSend Mail To: \nIncredible Science \nP.O.

It is EXTREMELY cold at -321 degrees F. Nitrogen was first liquefied at the Jagiellonian University on 15 April 1883 by Polish physicists, Zygmunt Wr\u00f3blewski and Karol Olszewski.

In that case, special gloves should be used while handling. However, a small splash or even pouring down skin will not burn immediately, because the evaporating gas thermally insulates to some extent, like touching a hot element very briefly with a wet finger. If the liquid nitrogen pools anywhere, it will burn severely.\n\nAs liquid nitrogen evaporates it reduces the oxygen concentration in the air and can act as an asphyxiant, especially in confined spaces.

                "description": "I wanted to make the BIGGEST and LONGEST Milk Food Coloring and Dish Soap experiment ever! I wonder if I could have the record in the Guiness Book of World Records for this!!! This experiment took a long time to film and even longer to edit but it was all worth it!\n\nI used milk that was passed its expiration that was going to be thrown out so no good milk went to waste!\n\nYou can easily make this cool Milk and Food Coloring science experiment at home! What you need:\n\nMilk\nSoap dish\nfood coloring\ncotton swab (q tip)\nplate\n\nJust place some drops of food coloring as shown in the video over the milk (regular whole milk works best) and dip the q tip into some dish soap. Place the q tip with the drop of soap directly onto the food coloring and watch the colorful fireworks!\n\nWhy it Works: Milk is mostly water, but it also has tiny droplets of fat in it...Dish soap, ( I used Dawn Dish Soap but any will work) makes the chemical bond that hold the fat together in the milk. The soap's polar, or hydrophilic (water-loving), end dissolves in water, and its hydrophobic (water-fearing) end attaches to a fat globule in the milk. This is when the fun begins.\n\nThe molecules of fat bend, roll, twist, and contort in all directions as the soap molecules race around to join up with the fat molecules. During all of this fat molecule gymnastics, the food coloring molecules are bumped and shoved everywhere, providing an easy way to observe all the invisible activity. As the soap becomes evenly mixed with the milk, the action slows down and eventually stops.\n\nTry adding another drop of soap to see if there's any more movement.

                    "description": "I wanted to make the BIGGEST and LONGEST Milk Food Coloring and Dish Soap experiment ever! I wonder if I could have the record in the Guiness Book of World Records for this!!! This experiment took a long time to film and even longer to edit but it was all worth it!\n\nI used milk that was passed its expiration that was going to be thrown out so no good milk went to waste!\n\nYou can easily make this cool Milk and Food Coloring science experiment at home! What you need:\n\nMilk\nSoap dish\nfood coloring\ncotton swab (q tip)\nplate\n\nJust place some drops of food coloring as shown in the video over the milk (regular whole milk works best) and dip the q tip into some dish soap. Place the q tip with the drop of soap directly onto the food coloring and watch the colorful fireworks!\n\nWhy it Works: Milk is mostly water, but it also has tiny droplets of fat in it...Dish soap, ( I used Dawn Dish Soap but any will work) makes the chemical bond that hold the fat together in the milk. The soap's polar, or hydrophilic (water-loving), end dissolves in water, and its hydrophobic (water-fearing) end attaches to a fat globule in the milk. This is when the fun begins.\n\nThe molecules of fat bend, roll, twist, and contort in all directions as the soap molecules race around to join up with the fat molecules. During all of this fat molecule gymnastics, the food coloring molecules are bumped and shoved everywhere, providing an easy way to observe all the invisible activity. As the soap becomes evenly mixed with the milk, the action slows down and eventually stops.\n\nTry adding another drop of soap to see if there's any more movement. You'll be surprised to see what happens. Add another drop of soap to start the process again.\n\n\nWe post a new videos often and a new video EVERY day on the vlog channel! so, if you liked this video and want more like this then SUBSCRIBE and COMMENT on what you want to see next!\n\nSend Mail To: \nIncredible Science \nP.O.

(should take a few minutes.)\n4) If you want to add flavor and/or color you can add flavoring or food coloring to the calcium chloride mixture (bowl#2)\n5) Bowl #3 - Fill up a bowl with water\n6) Fill ice cubes or water ball mold with Calcium Chloride mix and add food coloring or flavoring if you want.\n7) Freeze it\n8) Take ice cube or ice ball and place it into Sodium Alginate bowl (Bowl #1) and GENTLY use a spoon to cover the entire ball with the liquid. Try not to move the ice ball too much and make sure you leave it in for a few minutes so that it has time to form a covering around the ice ball.\n9) After a few minutes, gently take it out and place it in the water bowl.\n10) Wait for ice ball to dissolve and you can then take the water ball out and eat/drink it.\nENJOY!",

(should take a few minutes.)\n4) If you want to add flavor and/or color you can add flavoring or food coloring to the calcium chloride mixture (bowl#2)\n5) Bowl #3 - Fill up a bowl with water\n6) Fill ice cubes or water ball mold with Calcium Chloride mix and add food coloring or flavoring if you want.\n7) Freeze it\n8) Take ice cube or ice ball and place it into Sodium Alginate bowl (Bowl #1) and GENTLY use a spoon to cover the entire ball with the liquid. Try not to move the ice ball too much and make sure you leave it in for a few minutes so that it has time to form a covering around the ice ball.\n9) After a few minutes, gently take it out and place it in the water bowl.\n10) Wait for ice ball to dissolve and you can then take the water ball out and eat/drink it.\nENJOY!"

Mesmerize kids and adults as they watch the pendulum action of the balance balls hit and bounce off each other. Also makes for a great physics desk toy for teachers or place it in your office.\n\n \n\nDemonstrate the law of conservation of energy and momentum with a Newton's Cradle! This large Newton's Cradle is one of the most incredible -- and popular -- physics toys ever made. Named after Sir Isaac Newton and his Third Law of Motion, Newton's Cradle is an instant classic that's sure to provide a valuable glimpse into the world of physics in a way that's sure to grab the attention.\n\n \n\nNewton's Third Law states, \"for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\" and this is shown through how Newton's Cradle behaves.  When you lift 1, 2, 3, or 4 balls high and let go, the moving balls will hit the resting balls, causing the same number of balls that you lifted to swing back and up on the other side! You can also do some neat tricks. Check out the video below...Pretty cool, huh?\n\nIncredible Science Fun Learning Ideas:\n\n    A great into into physics and a perfect way to demonstrate Newton's Third Law of Motion.\n    Demonstrate the law of conservation of energy and momentum.",

Named after Sir Isaac Newton and his Third Law of Motion, Newton's Cradle is an instant classic that's sure to provide a valuable glimpse into the world of physics in a way that's sure to grab the attention.\n\n \n\nNewton's Third Law states, \"for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\" and this is shown through how Newton's Cradle behaves.  When you lift 1, 2, 3, or 4 balls high and let go, the moving balls will hit the resting balls, causing the same number of balls that you lifted to swing back and up on the other side! You can also do some neat tricks. Check out the video below...Pretty cool, huh?\n\nIncredible Science Fun Learning Ideas:\n\n    A great into into physics and a perfect way to demonstrate Newton's Third Law of Motion.\n    Demonstrate the law of conservation of energy and momentum."

A neodymium magnet is one of the strongest iron-based magnetic materials in the world. This magnetic material is formed when 2 neodymium magnets are combined with 14 iron ferrite atoms and 14 boron atoms to make the neodymium molecule, Nd2Fe14B. Neodymium magnets are made of these molecules and when they are fully magnetized, they can exert a powerful magnetic pull that can hold up to 600 times their own weight! Neodymium is a metallic element found in earth's crust. It was discovered in 1885 by Austrian chemist C.A. Von Welsbach. It occurs in minerals such as monazite and bastnasite. Neodymium magnets have only been in use since their discovery in 1984 and scientists continue to search for new ways to increase their power.",

With the included idea booklet you'll never get stuck thinking of ideas and with so many varieties of items to build the fun will never end!\n\nIncredible Science Fun Learning Ideas:\n\n    Learn about magnetism, geometric structures, building ideas, and problem solving.\n    Visual conception\n    Magformers have neodymium magnets encapsulated within all edge surfaces. A neodymium magnet is one of the strongest iron-based magnetic materials in the world. This magnetic material is formed when 2 neodymium magnets are combined with 14 iron ferrite atoms and 14 boron atoms to make the neodymium molecule, Nd2Fe14B. Neodymium magnets are made of these molecules and when they are fully magnetized, they can exert a powerful magnetic pull that can hold up to 600 times their own weight! Neodymium is a metallic element found in earth's crust. It was discovered in 1885 by Austrian chemist C.A. Von Welsbach. It occurs in minerals such as monazite and bastnasite. Neodymium magnets have only been in use since their discovery in 1984 and scientists continue to search for new ways to increase their power."

Grow these Sea Horses 400 times their size! What makes these sea horses so silly? Well, aside from the great jokes, animated role play, and an array of party tricks, your sea horses will actually grow in water. That's right, you read right, they grow in water! Play hide and go seek or catch with them once they are fully hydrated. Or not. Anyway, they grow and will retain their impressive stature for at least a week before shriveling to their pre-hydrated state. Store them in a sealed plastic bag, and use them again. \n\nDINOSAURS - Grow 7 Wiggly Dinosaurs! Watch these ferocious monsters grow incredibly in size when placed in water. Make sure that the container is big enough to contain your dinosaur or you will be sorry. Once hydrated, we advise you wear ear protection to protect against their ferociously loud roars and whistles. These dinosaurs are really dynamite because they are potty trained. That's right, no Dinosaur Dung on your floor from these guys. They will remain large and in charge for a week or so and then will start shrinking down to their original size.\n\nIncredible Science Fun Learning Ideas:\n\n    Hydrate, crush them, and bury them with a plant. They will be a source of moisture for the plant you partner it with! Or you could just smush it into the ground, or hose it down to the ground. Either way, they are non-toxic and not a threat to the environment.\n\n    Science Principles explored in this kit: biology, physics, applied science, scientific method \n\nWARNING: CHOKING HAZARD - Small parts.

Grow these Sea Horses 400 times their size! What makes these sea horses so silly? Well, aside from the great jokes, animated role play, and an array of party tricks, your sea horses will actually grow in water. That's right, you read right, they grow in water! Play hide and go seek or catch with them once they are fully hydrated. Or not. Anyway, they grow and will retain their impressive stature for at least a week before shriveling to their pre-hydrated state. Store them in a sealed plastic bag, and use them again. \n\nDINOSAURS - Grow 7 Wiggly Dinosaurs! Watch these ferocious monsters grow incredibly in size when placed in water. Make sure that the container is big enough to contain your dinosaur or you will be sorry. Once hydrated, we advise you wear ear protection to protect against their ferociously loud roars and whistles. These dinosaurs are really dynamite because they are potty trained. That's right, no Dinosaur Dung on your floor from these guys. They will remain large and in charge for a week or so and then will start shrinking down to their original size.\n\nIncredible Science Fun Learning Ideas:\n\n    Hydrate, crush them, and bury them with a plant. They will be a source of moisture for the plant you partner it with! Or you could just smush it into the ground, or hose it down to the ground. Either way, they are non-toxic and not a threat to the environment.\n\n    Science Principles explored in this kit: biology, physics, applied science, scientific method \n\nWARNING: CHOKING HAZARD - Small parts. Toy contains a small marble. Not for children under 3 yrs."

This amazing little robot always knows where the edge of the table is. When he arrives at the precipice, he will stop, turn around in the opposite direction and keep on going! Wind it up, place it on a table and watch it drive around and as soon as it reaches the edge, it amazingly turns and changes direction.\n\nObserve Newton's Third Law of Motion in action. It's action, reaction, and fun all in one. Get one or get a few and watch in amazement as these robots never fall off the edge of the table. Wind them up and watch 'em go. The science lies behind the perpendicular middle wheel under the car which automatically veers the robot away from going over the edge. It has two back wheels that power the robot, two front sensor wheels and one middle perpendicular wheel. As soon as the front wheels start to go off the edge of the table, the robot lowers a bit which then causes the middle perpendicular wheel to hit the table and turns the car back onto the table driving surface. It's amazing, fun and educational. \n\nIncredible Science Fun Learning Ideas:\n\n    Great item to demonstrate and teach Newton's Third Law of Motion\n    Gravity and object avoidance.\n    Discover the science behind it and the magic of the 5th horizontal wheel under the robot. Can you figure out how it always manages to stay on the table and never fall off the edge?",

                "description": "http://www.incrediblescience.com WATCH THE BLOOPER AT THE END! :)\nFind us on Facebook! http://www.facebook.com/IncredibleScienceToys Swing a cup of water, soda or any other liquid and it won't spill! Master the art of swinging the Spillnot.  The SpillNot is a simple hanging saucer consisting of the base and a webbing loop handle, it is useful, novel,... and fun. Based on the fundamental laws of physics, it is astonishingly effective.\n\nThe SpillNot allows a single open beverage in a wide variety of container shapes and sizes to be carried easily for long distances with amazingly little risk of spilling and without excessive concentration to avoid spills. The non-intuitive nature of the solution is so striking that in action, the invention is fascinating to observe. It's so simple, yet history has no record of a SpillNot before this!\n\nThe SpillNot provides entertainment and a challenge if desired. For example, some confidence and skill are required to perform tricks (best attempted outdoors in an open area with a small plastic cup of water) like flipping it upside down. However, when used simply to go from point A to point B with a beverage, it is often easier than carrying a full mug. It could also be a social ice-breaker by providing entertainment and an interesting topic for discussion, as the underlying physics are not trivial.\n\nIncredible Science Fun Learning Ideas:\n\n    The cool physics is that the liquid does not spill or slosh in the cup and the cup does not tend to slide on the SpillNot as it is carried, even if it is swung all around. Why not? The answer is that the loop handle (let's think of it as a 'thread') is very flexible and cannot deliver a lateral acceleration to the cup, which is what usually makes liquid spill from an open container that is not tipped.\n\n    That is, when people spill coffee while walking with an open mug, the liquid 'sloshes' out due to a horizontal acceleration of the cup. When the cup is accelerated, it applies a horizontal force to the liquid. The liquid, of course, has no fixed shape so the horizontal force causes a build-up of liquid at the side of the cup that is applying the force. If the build-up is higher than the side of the cup, there is a spill. If the force ceases without a spill, gravity pulls the liquid back down and the momentum of this flow causes a smaller build-up of liquid on the other side of the cup. With no additional forces, the oscillations eventually die down and equilibrium is reached with the surface of the liquid flat and level. However, when walking with a cup of liquid, a person may inadvertently apply horizontal accelerations to the cup at an interval that matches the resonant frequency of the oscillations described above. When this occurs, the amplitude of the oscillations can increase, causing the liquid to spill even if the person carrying the cup has not applied any single particularly large horizontal acceleration to the cup.\n\n    What happens when a person applies a horizontal acceleration to the handle (upper end of the 'thread') of the SpillNot? Because the thread is very flexible, no lateral force is applied to the saucer and thus no lateral force is applied to the cup. Instead, as the top of the thread moves horizontally, the saucer and cup swing up slightly in the opposite direction and the thread exerts a force on the cup through the saucer causing acceleration in the only direction in which the thread can exert a force, toward the upper thread end that is held. The direction of this force is parallel to the sides of the cup (by the SpillNot design), and thus does not tend to cause sloshing. At the same time, gravity pulls down equally on the saucer, cup, and liquid molecules in the cup, counter-acting the swing caused by horizontal acceleration of the upper thread end without causing sloshing.\n\n    More generally, swinging does not tend to cause the cup to slide off the saucer or liquid to slosh in the cup because the only force acting in a direction that is not parallel to the sides of the cup is the force of gravity, and gravity is equally accelerating all molecules of the saucer, cup, and liquid in the cup.\n\n    If the SpillNot is swung all the way around in a loop such that the cup is upside-down at the top of the arc, the liquid does not pour out of the cup due to the pseudo force, centrifugal force, which acts in the opposite direction as gravity when the cup is at the top of the arc.\n\n    Interestingly, for the webbing loop handle to lie flat and have no twists, it must be a Mobias strip (for ease of assembly, the strip handle for the standard SpillNot is sewn together)!",

                    "title": "The Incredible Spillnot Scary Physics",
                    "description": "http://www.incrediblescience.com WATCH THE BLOOPER AT THE END! :)\nFind us on Facebook! http://www.facebook.com/IncredibleScienceToys Swing a cup of water, soda or any other liquid and it won't spill! Master the art of swinging the Spillnot.  The SpillNot is a simple hanging saucer consisting of the base and a webbing loop handle, it is useful, novel,... and fun. Based on the fundamental laws of physics, it is astonishingly effective.\n\nThe SpillNot allows a single open beverage in a wide variety of container shapes and sizes to be carried easily for long distances with amazingly little risk of spilling and without excessive concentration to avoid spills. The non-intuitive nature of the solution is so striking that in action, the invention is fascinating to observe. It's so simple, yet history has no record of a SpillNot before this!\n\nThe SpillNot provides entertainment and a challenge if desired. For example, some confidence and skill are required to perform tricks (best attempted outdoors in an open area with a small plastic cup of water) like flipping it upside down. However, when used simply to go from point A to point B with a beverage, it is often easier than carrying a full mug. It could also be a social ice-breaker by providing entertainment and an interesting topic for discussion, as the underlying physics are not trivial.\n\nIncredible Science Fun Learning Ideas:\n\n    The cool physics is that the liquid does not spill or slosh in the cup and the cup does not tend to slide on the SpillNot as it is carried, even if it is swung all around. Why not? The answer is that the loop handle (let's think of it as a 'thread') is very flexible and cannot deliver a lateral acceleration to the cup, which is what usually makes liquid spill from an open container that is not tipped.\n\n    That is, when people spill coffee while walking with an open mug, the liquid 'sloshes' out due to a horizontal acceleration of the cup. When the cup is accelerated, it applies a horizontal force to the liquid. The liquid, of course, has no fixed shape so the horizontal force causes a build-up of liquid at the side of the cup that is applying the force. If the build-up is higher than the side of the cup, there is a spill. If the force ceases without a spill, gravity pulls the liquid back down and the momentum of this flow causes a smaller build-up of liquid on the other side of the cup. With no additional forces, the oscillations eventually die down and equilibrium is reached with the surface of the liquid flat and level. However, when walking with a cup of liquid, a person may inadvertently apply horizontal accelerations to the cup at an interval that matches the resonant frequency of the oscillations described above. When this occurs, the amplitude of the oscillations can increase, causing the liquid to spill even if the person carrying the cup has not applied any single particularly large horizontal acceleration to the cup.\n\n    What happens when a person applies a horizontal acceleration to the handle (upper end of the 'thread') of the SpillNot? Because the thread is very flexible, no lateral force is applied to the saucer and thus no lateral force is applied to the cup. Instead, as the top of the thread moves horizontally, the saucer and cup swing up slightly in the opposite direction and the thread exerts a force on the cup through the saucer causing acceleration in the only direction in which the thread can exert a force, toward the upper thread end that is held. The direction of this force is parallel to the sides of the cup (by the SpillNot design), and thus does not tend to cause sloshing. At the same time, gravity pulls down equally on the saucer, cup, and liquid molecules in the cup, counter-acting the swing caused by horizontal acceleration of the upper thread end without causing sloshing.\n\n    More generally, swinging does not tend to cause the cup to slide off the saucer or liquid to slosh in the cup because the only force acting in a direction that is not parallel to the sides of the cup is the force of gravity, and gravity is equally accelerating all molecules of the saucer, cup, and liquid in the cup.\n\n    If the SpillNot is swung all the way around in a loop such that the cup is upside-down at the top of the arc, the liquid does not pour out of the cup due to the pseudo force, centrifugal force, which acts in the opposite direction as gravity when the cup is at the top of the arc.\n\n    Interestingly, for the webbing loop handle to lie flat and have no twists, it must be a Mobias strip (for ease of assembly, the strip handle for the standard SpillNot is sewn together)!"

Readers, as if on safari, encounter eight wild animals that come alive. Using an innovative lenticular-based technology, precision sliding lenses, and original four-color video imagery, each image is like a 3-D movie on the page, delivering a rich, fluid, immersive visual experience. The cheetah bounds. The gazelle leaps. The African elephant snaps its ears. The gorilla munches the leaves off a branch. It's mesmerizing, as visually immediate as a Geography or Animal tv special.\n\nAccompanying the images is Safari, the guide: It begins with an evocative journal of a safari along the Mara River in Kenya and interweaves the history of safaris. Then for each animal there is a lively, informative essay and an at-a-glance list of important facts. It's the romance of being on safari\u2014and the almost visceral thrill of seeing the animals in motion\u2014 in a book unlike any other.\n\nCheck out our other amazing book using Scanimation\u00ae technology.

Those are basically big words that mean that your Gravity Goo is going to soak up lots of water and you'll find that it likes to stick together.\n\nSubscribe!: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=IncredibleScience\nBuy it Here: http://www.incrediblescience.com/gravity-goo.html\nFind us on Facebook! http://www.facebook.com/IncredibleScienceToys\nFollow us on Instragram: http://instagram.com/incrediblescience"

If you are familiar with the famous Iodine Clock Reaction then you know exactly what this is, if not, you're in for a real treat. Mix two clear solutions together, wait a few seconds and then WOW! It INSTANTLY changes to Black! But the amazement isn't done. Add a third ingredient to incredibly transform the black liquid (Iodine) into a clear see through solution again! You'll amaze everyone with this, including yourself, time and time again! Use it as a science fair experiment or as a magic trick. Either way it's incredible science fun!"
