If the laser was running at 25% power (4 amps/50 watts) that would be about 110mw/cm2 from the telescope. However, your pupil is only half this size fully open, so a pilot could theoretically receive a 50mw/cm2 exposure.  A decent amount, but you have to remember even the smallest plane is traveling 150 miles per hour which would limit total exposure time to only 3ms( time it takes to cross a 9 inch beam). That puts it at the cusp of the maximum exposure limit, which is defined as \"about 10% of the dose that has a 50% chance of creating damage under worst-case conditions.\"  Here is the chart im referencing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_safety#/media/File:IEC60825_MPE_W_s.png\n\nSo even under perfect conditions, this would still be 10x less than the exposure that carries a risk of damage.   That's assuming perfect conditions, but in reality it was a hazy night, the laser would not be perfectly collimated, the atmosphere would distort the beam,  the windows in the airplane would deflect some of the beam, unless the pilot was staring directly at the beam they would receive a smaller dose, I tried to keep the beam moving when up in the sky, and most planes are moving faster. all of this meaning the pilot would be exposed to a much lower amount of laser energy in the real world than under perfect conditions.  even at full power this laser is still within the safety factor of the maximum exposure limit.

Click here to start using LastPass: https://lastpass.onelink.me/HzaM/2020\n\nMy brother and I decided to make an old school video back at the old backyard! we poured molten aluminum on some glass cubes and spheres to see what would happen, and to get some cool slow motion footage. We also melted glass and aluminum together to see if they would mix. Its unfortunate the glass sphere melted and fell over in the kiln, oh well, it was still interesting!"

Well, i have made one before but it was not a 'good' fresnel lens.  If you want to learn more about fresnel lenses this is a good website - https://rimstar.org/equip/fresnel_lens.htm  They have a youtube channel too with lots of educational content. https://www.youtube.com/user/RimstarOrg\n\nAnd of course shoutout to The King of Random where i first saw this idea ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrje73EyKag"

Then I tried shocking the battery with a tesla coil. Surprisingly that did not work, so I connected it to a car battery to overcharge it and it worked great. Of course, by working great i mean it caught on fire. Finally I incinerated the battery with a 30W infrared laser in a fishtank filled with 100% pure oxygen.",

Then I tried shocking the battery with a tesla coil. Surprisingly that did not work, so I connected it to a car battery to overcharge it and it worked great. Of course, by working great i mean it caught on fire. Finally I incinerated the battery with a 30W infrared laser in a fishtank filled with 100% pure oxygen."

I think a 6ft barrel was enough to show what a supersonic nerf dart can do. \n\nDavekni got a pingpong ball going 2000mph which is 2930 ft/s!! (mach 2.5). His barrel was 20ft long. It can shoot through 3/4in plywood! You can see that video here- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xuwu4gjNbQ\n\nI always thought the speed of sound was the limiting factor, because the flow 'chokes' at mach 1. Its a big controversy among air-gunners, and theres like a 900 post topic on it here https://www.gatewaytoairguns.org/GTA/index.php?topic=102604.540.  Some guy got one going like 2100 ft/s which I thought was impossible. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUq4OQqZ2bw So it prompted me to do some research.\n\nIt turns out flow does choke at mach 1, but its only the mass flow that chokes. The gas can still expand supersonically.\n\n\n\nAlso a big thanks to Dr. Carl Knowlen from University of Washington, and u/Overunderrated,  u/TheQueq, and u/InductorMan from reddit.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the papers I referenced:\n\nA COMPARISON OF DISTRIBUTED INJECTION\nHYPERVELOCITY ACCELERATORS - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268456817_A_comparison_of_distributed_injection_hypervelocity_accelerators\n Probably the most concise and easily understood!\n\n\nNumerical Evaluation of a Light-Gas Gun Facility for Impact Test\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/270629342_Numerical_Evaluation_of_a_Light-Gas_Gun_Facility_for_Impact_Test\nShows different muzzle velocities for different barrel lengths\n\n\nTHE THEORY OF HIGH SPEED GUNS\nhttp://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/475660.pdf\nProbably the most extensive on the subject \"The reader Is assumed to be an advanced student in engineering.\" I hope you payed better attention in physics that I did.\n\nOutro music by MDK, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_t5Lm040Gw\n\nFortnite clip from https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8e7vq6/the_fortnite_foodchain/",

Some guy got one going like 2100 ft/s which I thought was impossible. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUq4OQqZ2bw So it prompted me to do some research.\n\nIt turns out flow does choke at mach 1, but its only the mass flow that chokes. The gas can still expand supersonically.\n\n\n\nAlso a big thanks to Dr. Carl Knowlen from University of Washington, and u/Overunderrated,  u/TheQueq, and u/InductorMan from reddit.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the papers I referenced:\n\nA COMPARISON OF DISTRIBUTED INJECTION\nHYPERVELOCITY ACCELERATORS - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268456817_A_comparison_of_distributed_injection_hypervelocity_accelerators\n Probably the most concise and easily understood!\n\n\nNumerical Evaluation of a Light-Gas Gun Facility for Impact Test\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/270629342_Numerical_Evaluation_of_a_Light-Gas_Gun_Facility_for_Impact_Test\nShows different muzzle velocities for different barrel lengths\n\n\nTHE THEORY OF HIGH SPEED GUNS\nhttp://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/475660.pdf\nProbably the most extensive on the subject \"The reader Is assumed to be an advanced student in engineering.\" I hope you payed better attention in physics that I did.\n\nOutro music by MDK, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_t5Lm040Gw\n\nFortnite clip from https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8e7vq6/the_fortnite_foodchain/"

                "description": "Join the science discord! https://discord.gg/pw5sZ3PTye Ive got a bit of a Raccoon problem at my house\u2026 I built something to fix the problem. It breaks multiple local ordinances and a few international treaties, but I give you THE GIANT MOUSETRAP! It took over 3 weeks to build and cost around $360 to build, with the main expenses being the winch, and the multiple pipe fittings to adapt the springs to the bar.\n\nMarks Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNds3PIBqnQ\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheBackyardScientistOfficial\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/backyardscientistofficial/\nTwitter: @ChemicalKevy http://twitter.com/ChemicalKevy\nWebsite: http://thebackyardscient.ist/\n\nEvery time I wound it up, something broke. Originally i built it to use garage door springs, but they were not strong enough. Once I switched to coil springs stuff started breaking.\n\nFirst it was the bar, which bent, and needed corner enforcement's welded on. \n\nThen the 'axel' running down the center of the springs bent, so I needed to add hardware to counteract the winch pulling on it.\n\nNext, the springs themselves broke. I learned something about trying to weld tempered steel.. It just creates stresses and the weld was much more brittle (harder) than the spring steel. I had to re-weld it and    heat up the spring up to about 3  inches from the weld, this created a more gradual slope of hardness, so the spring bent where i welded instead of snapping.\n\nThen the bar bent in the middle, so I had to weld a 4' long 1\" corner to it. \n\nFinally, the arms of the bar are flexing when I tighten the springs too much, but I think this is okay, for now!",

                    "description": "Join the science discord! https://discord.gg/pw5sZ3PTye Ive got a bit of a Raccoon problem at my house\u2026 I built something to fix the problem. It breaks multiple local ordinances and a few international treaties, but I give you THE GIANT MOUSETRAP! It took over 3 weeks to build and cost around $360 to build, with the main expenses being the winch, and the multiple pipe fittings to adapt the springs to the bar.\n\nMarks Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNds3PIBqnQ\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheBackyardScientistOfficial\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/backyardscientistofficial/\nTwitter: @ChemicalKevy http://twitter.com/ChemicalKevy\nWebsite: http://thebackyardscient.ist/\n\nEvery time I wound it up, something broke. Originally i built it to use garage door springs, but they were not strong enough. Once I switched to coil springs stuff started breaking.\n\nFirst it was the bar, which bent, and needed corner enforcement's welded on. \n\nThen the 'axel' running down the center of the springs bent, so I needed to add hardware to counteract the winch pulling on it.\n\nNext, the springs themselves broke. I learned something about trying to weld tempered steel.. It just creates stresses and the weld was much more brittle (harder) than the spring steel. I had to re-weld it and    heat up the spring up to about 3  inches from the weld, this created a more gradual slope of hardness, so the spring bent where i welded instead of snapping.\n\nThen the bar bent in the middle, so I had to weld a 4' long 1\" corner to it. \n\nFinally, the arms of the bar are flexing when I tighten the springs too much, but I think this is okay, for now!"

They sell to individuals, and because they make the refractory materials the price is dirt cheap, like $36 for a 12 pack of insulating firebricks. On amazon they are $27 for 2 firebricks. \n\nOther materials: \nRed Hot cannonball - 6lb, ~3 inch cast iron shotput.\nPropane burner for foundry - http://www.ebay.com/itm/U-S-Made-gas-burner-blacksmith-forge-raku-kiln-propane-foundry-with-regulator-/232172874783?hash=item360e94ec1f:g:6RoAAOSwzOxUYmHZ\nCrucible - https://www.amazon.com/10-Graphite-Crucible-Refining-Aluminum/dp/B00FBGAG6G"

Im basically a bonafide evil genius now. Freeze your cat, girlfriend, or flowers, the possibilities are endless..! wait no, thats about it. PS before Jeopardy thinks about  suing me for using their music, remember who has the freeze ray now! Kevin: 1 - Alex: 0\nSome notes about the gun:\nThere are commercial liquid nitrogen guns used by dermatologists to freeze warts and skin cancer off. The guy that sells me liquid nitrogen was telling me about them. he says they have a pressure release valve that keeps the pressure at around 70psi. The problem is its hard to make a thermos thats also pressure rated because you have a pressure on the inside of the flask, then a vacuum directly on the other side. They are fragile and expensive. I tried to put a nichrome heating element inside the thermos to increase pressure, but it ended up not working that great. shaking the thermos made way more pressure!",

Im basically a bonafide evil genius now. Freeze your cat, girlfriend, or flowers, the possibilities are endless..! wait no, thats about it. PS before Jeopardy thinks about  suing me for using their music, remember who has the freeze ray now! Kevin: 1 - Alex: 0\nSome notes about the gun:\nThere are commercial liquid nitrogen guns used by dermatologists to freeze warts and skin cancer off. The guy that sells me liquid nitrogen was telling me about them. he says they have a pressure release valve that keeps the pressure at around 70psi. The problem is its hard to make a thermos thats also pressure rated because you have a pressure on the inside of the flask, then a vacuum directly on the other side. They are fragile and expensive. I tried to put a nichrome heating element inside the thermos to increase pressure, but it ended up not working that great. shaking the thermos made way more pressure!"

Honestly this dude is awesome, ever time I go over there the lawn just gets destroyed, things catch fire that aren't supposed to, and hes just a generally cool guy, thanks Travis!\n\nThis is part 2 from my liquid metal bullets experiment! Last week we tested how these bullets preform by shooting them into a tank of water, this week we got to have some fun! We shot watermelons, cinderblocks, starting fluid, and a bunch more. Its a long video, but totally worth staying till the end because you get to see me choke on a bug haha.\n\nThe first test was shooting bullets at a watermelon. We shot Sodium, Potassium, and a special alloy of sodium &amp; potassium thats a liquid! Its basically the closest thing to shooting mercury out of a gun!\nThese bullets are insane! \n\nFor this video I bought 150g of potassium for $325 , and 500g of sodium for $150.  Each bullet holds 1g of metal. I also had to buy regular .45 hollowpoint ammo to modify ~.50c/bullet. At these prices, each potassium bullet costs $2.50 Each sodium bullet cost .80c. The liquid alloy is 25% sodium, 75% potassium.\n\n\nThese bullets must be stored under dried and degassed solvent, blanketed in a dry, and inert atmosphere. Storing the bullets in regular oil or other hydrocarbon solvent will quickly destroy the entire bullet and casing in less than a week. Common oils and solvents are slightly permeable to oxygen and moisture which will react with the alkali metals to form corrosive hydroxides which will etch the zinc in the brass casing. Oil will enter the casing and inactivate the smokeless powder. After 1 week 1/10 of the bullets stored under oil did not fire.\n\nSong - http://opus1.sourceaudio.com/#!details?id=13619411",

I recorded the whole thing on a high speed phantom camera borrowed from http://Aimed-Research.com.\n\nI melted the soft lead from .45 caliber hollow point bullets and replaced it with super soft sodium and potassium metal. When you combine sodium and potassium they form a liquid metal! I tested these bullets in a acrylic test chamber filled with water, and recorded the results on a high speed camera.\n\nI chose .45 bullets because they could hold the most metal. Once I melt out the lead, the empty copper jackets can hold around 1 cubic centimeter of material. Lead has a density of around 11g/cm3, and sodium &amp; potassium have a density of only ~1g/cm3. They bullets are much lighter, so they don't have as much kinetic energy. Even though they carry less energy, they expand way faster because of the soft metals. The energy is transferred instantly! A lead bullet takes around 2 feet to stop in water, but these bullets stop in 6 inches!  \n\nThis was my most expensive video ever, I spent $1300 on sodium, potassium, and a gun!\n\nBe sure to follow my on facebook and twitter!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheBackyardS...\nhttps://twitter.com/ChemicalKevy",

A lead bullet takes around 2 feet to stop in water, but these bullets stop in 6 inches!  \n\nThis was my most expensive video ever, I spent $1300 on sodium, potassium, and a gun!\n\nBe sure to follow my on facebook and twitter!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheBackyardS...\nhttps://twitter.com/ChemicalKevy"

Greg, one of the pack leaders,  designed a GPS receiver that transmits data over amateur radio frequencies.  Amature radio frequencies have a very long range, so our signal was able to be picked up by any station within line-of-sight, even at 100,000 feet!\n\nNotes From Greg - Posted from comments for more visibility.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreg Spiegel----\n I have been asked for some specifics on the balloon and it's payload.\nThe APRS tracker was from Byonics ( MT-1000 HAB Combo) \nThe Wildlife tracker was from American Wildlife Enterprises http://www.americanwildlifeenterprises.com/ \nThe balloon was from Kaymont Balloons (1000g) http://kaymontballoons.com/\nThe batteries used in the transmitter were energizer lithiums.\nThe GoPro was a Hero 3+ with the extended battery backpack. 32GB card full by the time we retrieved it but battery lasted the whole time.\nThe parachute was a modified parachute from Sunward http://www.sunward1.com/\nThe payload was made from a physical therapy styrofoam roll 6\" diameter.\nTotal weight was 1.5lbs.\n\nPrelaunch calculations were done at \nPrelaunch prediction site\nhttp://predict.habhub.org/#!/uuid=3231614bda403fcd7ed2da91dd5b9f2fdb7d2574\n\nAscent Rate/ Neck Lift/ Burst altitude calculations\nhttp://habhub.org/calc/ \n\nTracking Site from the balloon during its actual flight\nhttp://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&call=a%2FKG4OBF&timerange=86400&tail=86400\n\nNews articles about the launch.\n\nNewspaper Friday 1/1/16\nhttp://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/cub-scouts-engineer-weather-balloon-plan-20160101/\n\nNewspaper Friday 1/8/16\nhttp://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/despite-hard-landing-cub-scouts-balloon-drift-deemed-a-success-20160105/\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe balloon popped at 106,000 feet and landed 145 miles away from our launch. The kids had a great time, and it was a great adventure to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. \n\nCub/boyscouts are a great organization,  you can help give kids experiances like this by donating to your local scouting council here: http://aplacetogive.scouting.org/ \n\nThanks to Greg and Joe for sharing footage to make this video possible also.\n\nThe complete trip is almost 3 hours, and is 13GB of data!\n Im making a timelapse now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmRx5SQP2gw\n and Im going to upload the complete trip overnight.",

                    "description": "Join the science discord! https://discord.gg/pw5sZ3PTye My friend Joe and Coyt invited me to come hangout and watch the cub scouts launch a high altitude balloon for their engineering pin.  Greg, one of the pack leaders,  designed a GPS receiver that transmits data over amateur radio frequencies.  Amature radio frequencies have a very long range, so our signal was able to be picked up by any station within line-of-sight, even at 100,000 feet!\n\nNotes From Greg - Posted from comments for more visibility.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreg Spiegel----\n I have been asked for some specifics on the balloon and it's payload.\nThe APRS tracker was from Byonics ( MT-1000 HAB Combo) \nThe Wildlife tracker was from American Wildlife Enterprises http://www.americanwildlifeenterprises.com/ \nThe balloon was from Kaymont Balloons (1000g) http://kaymontballoons.com/\nThe batteries used in the transmitter were energizer lithiums.\nThe GoPro was a Hero 3+ with the extended battery backpack. 32GB card full by the time we retrieved it but battery lasted the whole time.\nThe parachute was a modified parachute from Sunward http://www.sunward1.com/\nThe payload was made from a physical therapy styrofoam roll 6\" diameter.\nTotal weight was 1.5lbs.\n\nPrelaunch calculations were done at \nPrelaunch prediction site\nhttp://predict.habhub.org/#!/uuid=3231614bda403fcd7ed2da91dd5b9f2fdb7d2574\n\nAscent Rate/ Neck Lift/ Burst altitude calculations\nhttp://habhub.org/calc/ \n\nTracking Site from the balloon during its actual flight\nhttp://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&call=a%2FKG4OBF&timerange=86400&tail=86400\n\nNews articles about the launch.\n\nNewspaper Friday 1/1/16\nhttp://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/cub-scouts-engineer-weather-balloon-plan-20160101/\n\nNewspaper Friday 1/8/16\nhttp://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/despite-hard-landing-cub-scouts-balloon-drift-deemed-a-success-20160105/\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe balloon popped at 106,000 feet and landed 145 miles away from our launch. The kids had a great time, and it was a great adventure to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. \n\nCub/boyscouts are a great organization,  you can help give kids experiances like this by donating to your local scouting council here: http://aplacetogive.scouting.org/ \n\nThanks to Greg and Joe for sharing footage to make this video possible also.\n\nThe complete trip is almost 3 hours, and is 13GB of data!\n Im making a timelapse now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmRx5SQP2gw\n and Im going to upload the complete trip overnight."

It doesn't lift you high into the air like back to the future, but it perfectly emulates the feeling! Its just a wooden board with a rim around the edge to hole 3 blocks of dry-ice in place. As the dry ice sublimates, the pressure from the expanding gas is enough greatly reduce surface friction and you can glide on any smooth surface. The wood floor in this video was far from perfect, but it did the job pretty well!  I would consider this a real hoverboard because the dry ice is not in contact with the surface. There is actually a very thin layer of gas between the two surfaces. The problem is any irregularities in the floor surface will contact the dry ice, slowing the board down. If this was on a glass surface, I think air friction would slow you down before the surface friction!\n\nThe board can last for an hour before the ice gets too thin. I spent $100 total on dry ice testing, and making this video. each block costs around $15.

Im trying out a great question from somebody on my facebook page. He wanted to know if a hot object will fall faster than a cold object through water. I set up my fishtank and dropped red-hot steel balls through water to see if they fall faster. This would be a great science fair project if you don't burn down your house."

Ive figured out some practical uses, like turning plastic into metal, and 'welding' broken plastic together.\n\nIts easy to turn any 3D drawn or 3D printed  plastic object into metal. You just need to encase it in plaster, and drill some holes through the plaster to the object. Thats so you can melt out the plastic, leaving a hollow mold you can fill with metal.\n\nFixing plastic objects is pretty straight forward, you just need to use the same type of plastic to fix it with.\n\nI also pranked my girlfriend with a 3D drawn plastic spider, she got scared and started to punch me haha, but I gave her a rose made out of color changing plastic and everything was ok :)\n\nDry Ice Air-Hockey is pretty fun, but you need a really clean and flat surface! Im thinking about scaling this up, and making a dry ice skateboard.",

Ive figured out some practical uses, like turning plastic into metal, and 'welding' broken plastic together.\n\nIts easy to turn any 3D drawn or 3D printed  plastic object into metal. You just need to encase it in plaster, and drill some holes through the plaster to the object. Thats so you can melt out the plastic, leaving a hollow mold you can fill with metal.\n\nFixing plastic objects is pretty straight forward, you just need to use the same type of plastic to fix it with.\n\nI also pranked my girlfriend with a 3D drawn plastic spider, she got scared and started to punch me haha, but I gave her a rose made out of color changing plastic and everything was ok :)\n\nDry Ice Air-Hockey is pretty fun, but you need a really clean and flat surface! Im thinking about scaling this up, and making a dry ice skateboard."

These are used for Airsoft, Paintball, and BB guns. They contain high pressure Carbon Dioxide gas behind a thin metal disc. If you puncture the disc, the gas will escape and propel the rocket fast! Its not a replacement for black powder engines, but they can be just as fun, just watch where they land! \n\nOh and try not to get blasted in the face like I did. I think I got dry ice in my sinus :(\n\nKrusty Krab song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzMJk8nGpoc\n\nI read all my comments, but sometimes I miss a few!

I poured metals with different melting points to see if they had any different effects when they came in contact with water. From Pewter (350f/170c) all the way to Thermite (4000f/2204c). Some of them exploded, some of them sank and made molten metal drippy-castles, but they were all interesting. Here is a list of metals I used, and their melting points:\n\nPewter  338\u2013446 \u00b0F - 170\u2013230 \u00b0C\nTin -  449.5\u00b0F (231.9\u00b0C)\nBismuth - 520.6\u00b0F (271.4\u00b0C)\nLead - 621.5\u00b0F (327.5\u00b0C)\nZinc - 787.2\u00b0F (419.5\u00b0C)\nAluminum - 1,221\u00b0F (660.3\u00b0C)\nIron - 2,800\u00b0F (1,538\u00b0C) 4000f (2200 C) Reaction\n\nI don't have anything against the usage of celsius, or aluminiuminum. Im not calling you communists either, im just messing with you guys because you always yell about my pronunciation ;) (but seriously its aluminum in America!)\n\n\n\nI poured in the metals as soon as they were fully liquid, so they could not raise too far above the melting point and skew the results. This video is a great demonstration of the leidenfrost effect.\n\n\n\nI will be uploading all the uncut footage in slow motion, as well as behind-the-scenes for you guys soon, I will post it on social media  and in the video description. I could not include the whole stuff in the video, because 10 seconds at 240fps is 100 seconds long played back.

So after watching NightHawkInLight's video I knew I had to do this. It was easy to do, all I needed was a TS8000 torch, and 10 feet of 7/8 tubing from the hardware store.\n\nInspiration for this video NightHawkInLights video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXoqw-_uDx4\n\nThe torch is self-igniting, meaning it has an electric sparker built in. When the button is pressed halfway, the torch mixes a perfect combination of propane and air into the tube. When the button is fully pressed the torch sparks sending a flame flying through the tube. \n\nI tried to color the flame with some boric acid, and it turned bright green. NightHawkInLight gave me the idea to try powered charcoal to shoot embers and orange flame, worked great!\n\nWell this experiment was not explody enough for me, so I used the same concept to build a propane powered cannon. This is honestly the best gas cannon I've ever used, it is just so simple. You could probably shoot 20 golfballs a minute the length of a football field or farther. The canon shot golf balls over 600 feet in the air!! \n\nIm sure you can do tons of other cool things with this concept, let my know if you want me to try something!\n\nPlans for the cannon - http://imgur.com/aIvOtPj\nDifferent torches, and if they will work - http://imgur.com/a/w6Ji8\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n One important thing I forgot to mention in the video is the fit of the object in the barrel. If you completely plug the barrel the gas mixture does not enter the tube, because torch only 'passively' blows the mixture down the tube into the combustion chamber. All the projectiles i shot had some 'slack' in the barrel.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you followed me on social media, you would have gotten sneak peeks for this video!\n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheBackyardScientistOfficial\n\nTwitter: @ChemicalKevy\nhttp://twitter.com/ChemicalKevy",

I this video I throw water bottles filled with dry ice, and liquid nitrogen into my pool. This is seriously cool.

I hacked this squirt gun flamethrower together for only $10!\n\nThe ratio of methanol/boric acid :12oz of methanol 1 teaspoon of boric acid.\n\nI do this so you don't have to :).. or so your parents wont yell at you for melting all the garden gnomes ;)\n\nMethanol is sold in America as \"HEET\" in the automotive section of almost any store. You can not drink this alcohol, its poisonous!\n\nBoric acid is sold as a roach killer in a lot of stores also. its a white powder. Even though its sold as an insecticide, its so safe you can buy human grade boric acid as an antiseptic, and to help athletes foot, cool!\n\n\"how to make green fire\" \"green fire\" \"green flame\" \"Flamethrower\" \"flame thrower\" how to make flamethrower",

Bored on spring break? looking for a project? Look no further!\nIn this video I make and demonstrate how I made a green flamethrower from a squirt gun, antifreeze (methanol), and Roach killer (Boric Acid).  I hacked this squirt gun flamethrower together for only $10!\n\nThe ratio of methanol/boric acid :12oz of methanol 1 teaspoon of boric acid.\n\nI do this so you don't have to :).. or so your parents wont yell at you for melting all the garden gnomes ;)\n\nMethanol is sold in America as \"HEET\" in the automotive section of almost any store. You can not drink this alcohol, its poisonous!\n\nBoric acid is sold as a roach killer in a lot of stores also. its a white powder. Even though its sold as an insecticide, its so safe you can buy human grade boric acid as an antiseptic, and to help athletes foot, cool!\n\n\"how to make green fire\" \"green fire\" \"green flame\" \"Flamethrower\" \"flame thrower\" how to make flamethrower"
