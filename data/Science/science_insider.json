They clean and piece together the bones, and prepare them for research and museum collections. With 4 million specimens already in scientists' hands, why keep excavating after more than 100 years?\n\nThe La Brea Tar Pits is one of the only paleontological sites on Earth that has preserved an entire ecosystem over time, from plants to camels to bugs. And every new fossil not only helps tell the story of the Los Angeles Basin over 50,000 years but also gives us clues about how current species, including humans, could weather climate change in the future. \n\nWe went to the La Brea Tar Pits to see how specimens are discovered, cleaned, and pieced together to build a record of the last 50,000 years.\n\nMORE SCIENCE INSIDER VIDEOS: \nDermatologists Debunk 8 Body-Odor Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/bJ-CmpYifB4\nNeurologists Debunk 11 Brain Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/eDQquPtqMZs\nEye Doctors Debunk 13 More Vision Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/0ZFtHzZqYDY\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fossil #ColossalCollection #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsi...\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_ins...\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\nHow 4 Million Fossils Are Excavated At La Brea Tar Pits | Colossal Collections | Science Insider",

                    "description": "Excavators at the La Brea Tar Pits & Museum work to dig up fossils of mammoths, dire wolves, giant sloths and more out of the ground. They clean and piece together the bones, and prepare them for research and museum collections. With 4 million specimens already in scientists' hands, why keep excavating after more than 100 years?\n\nThe La Brea Tar Pits is one of the only paleontological sites on Earth that has preserved an entire ecosystem over time, from plants to camels to bugs. And every new fossil not only helps tell the story of the Los Angeles Basin over 50,000 years but also gives us clues about how current species, including humans, could weather climate change in the future. \n\nWe went to the La Brea Tar Pits to see how specimens are discovered, cleaned, and pieced together to build a record of the last 50,000 years.\n\nMORE SCIENCE INSIDER VIDEOS: \nDermatologists Debunk 8 Body-Odor Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/bJ-CmpYifB4\nNeurologists Debunk 11 Brain Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/eDQquPtqMZs\nEye Doctors Debunk 13 More Vision Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/0ZFtHzZqYDY\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fossil #ColossalCollection #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsi...\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_ins...\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\nHow 4 Million Fossils Are Excavated At La Brea Tar Pits | Colossal Collections | Science Insider"

They talk about the real reason people get mosquito bites, how resilient cockroaches are, and the best way to catch mice. They also debunk the myth that all ticks will give you Lyme disease. In fact, only the black-legged tick (aka the deer tick) can give you Lyme disease, and usually only if it feeds on you for more than 24 hours. \n\nSkinner is the president and co-owner of A&C Pest Management, a pest-management company that specializes in green approaches. He has over 35 years of experience in pest control, from ants to termites, rodents, wasps, and more. You can learn more about his work here: https://www.acpest.com/about-us \n\nGangloff-Kaufmann is the coordinator of community integrated pest management, or IPM, at the New York State IPM Program at Cornell University. She's been educating others for over 20 years about bedbugs, tick surveillance, and other household and landscape pests and pollinators. Her work also focuses on promoting IPM approaches in schools, public spaces, and homes.

                    "description": "Entomologists Jim Skinner and Jody Gangloff-Kaufmann debunk 15 myths about pests. They talk about the real reason people get mosquito bites, how resilient cockroaches are, and the best way to catch mice. They also debunk the myth that all ticks will give you Lyme disease. In fact, only the black-legged tick (aka the deer tick) can give you Lyme disease, and usually only if it feeds on you for more than 24 hours. \n\nSkinner is the president and co-owner of A&C Pest Management, a pest-management company that specializes in green approaches. He has over 35 years of experience in pest control, from ants to termites, rodents, wasps, and more. You can learn more about his work here: https://www.acpest.com/about-us \n\nGangloff-Kaufmann is the coordinator of community integrated pest management, or IPM, at the New York State IPM Program at Cornell University. She's been educating others for over 20 years about bedbugs, tick surveillance, and other household and landscape pests and pollinators. Her work also focuses on promoting IPM approaches in schools, public spaces, and homes.

So your best bet is to keep social distancing for as long as you can.\n\nMORE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:\nWill Warm Weather Stop COVID-19?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7SBKPO-nkg\nWhat Could Be The Fastest Way To End The Coronavirus Crisis?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXW9cDN0IpY\nWhat Coronavirus Symptoms Look Like, Day By Day\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA\n\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\n#Coronavirus #COVID-19 #ScienceInsider\n\r\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \r\n\r\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\r\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\r\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\r\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\r\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\r\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nCan You Get The Coronavirus Twice?"

One reason is that the pool of people who can be infected is much larger in this pandemic. So seasonality likely won\u2019t have as much of an impact until more people develop immunity to it.

Viruses are trying to infect new hosts all the time, but there are a lot of barriers that they need to get through before that can happen. First, a new virus needs to come in contact with humans, then overcome the body's natural defenses, and finally spread between people. But at any point along the way it can be stopped dead in its tracks.

It's true. Taken altogether, countries outside the U.S. see around 200-300 twisters annually. Compared to more than 1,200 that strike American soil. So, what makes the US so special?\n\nTo make a tornado, you need just the right mix of ingredients: Warm, humid air near the ground. Cold air higher up in the atmosphere. And wind that overlaps while moving at different speeds or directions. Believe it or not, few places on Earth check all of these boxes. And none compares to the Great Plains of the United States \u2014 AKA, tornado alley.\n\nLargely thanks to this: The Gulf of Mexico. Markowski: So the Gulf of Mexico is actually the warmest body of water on earth at its latitude. And when it comes to making tornadoes, the warmer the air, the better. As hot air rises off the Gulf, it crawls north across the Plains. Where it meets air blowing west out of the American Rockies.\n\nWhen the two winds come together, they can create a vortex of wind that spins horizontally. Now, here's where that warm air is key. As it rises \u2014 as warm air likes to do \u2014 it tilts the tube vertical to form a rotating storm called a supercell.\u00a0And up to 20% of supercells spawn tornados.\n\nNow, you can find these conditions elsewhere in the world. Markowski: Anywhere where you can find warm water that's equatorward of some area that also finds itself downwind of a major mountain chain, tornadoes tend to be an elevated risk. Take Bangladesh, for example.\n\nThere, warm, humid air spreads from the Bay of Bengal and travels north. Where it overlaps with winds blowing southeast out of the Himalayan Mountains. This produces an average of around six tornadoes each year.\n\nIncluding the world's deadliest. Which killed 1,300 people and injured 12,000 more in 1989. But six tornadoes a year doesn't compare to the 12,000 or so we see in the US. And tornadoes don't just strike the US during tornado season from March through June. In January, for example, We get about 36 tornadoes!\n\nThat's because you can find those perfect tornado conditions year-round. And over a region several times the size of Bangladesh. That said, tornadoes in the US may not be as common as you think. Markowski: \"Most people greatly overestimate how often tornadoes occur in Tornado Alley.\"\n\n\"I mean if you watch the movie Twister, it's easy to think that every day at 4 o'clock they sound the alarm and you just go underground, but really most people that live in Oklahoma have never seen a tornado before.\"\n\nThat's because even in Oklahoma, the tornado capital of the world, tornadoes only strike the same spot once every 1,200-1,500 years, on average. But if you are unlucky enough to spot one, be sure to keep your distance. Tornado winds can reach a whopping 400 kilometers per hour! \u00a0\n\nPlenty fast enough to sweep you, and everything else off the ground.\n\nWhy America Has More Tornadoes Than Anywhere Else In The World",

                "description": "Humans can\u2019t grow new teeth. But we\u2019re not alone. Most mammals can\u2019t. But many reptiles and fish can grow hundreds, or even thousands of new teeth in a lifetime. The reason has to do with how reptiles and mammals evolved differently over 300 million years ago.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nHumans need dentists. It\u2019s a fact. In 2017 alone, Americans spent $124 billion on dental visits. And an estimated 90% of adults in the US have fillings.\n\nBut many animals don\u2019t have this problem. Because they can regrow their teeth replacing old, damaged ones with brand new pearly whites.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if you could do that? Well, there\u2019s actually an important trade off for this nuisance.\n\nOnly a handful of mammals can regrow teeth multiple times, compared to the 50,000 species of reptiles and fish. Take geckos, for example, who will replace all 100 teeth, or so, every 3 to 4 months. And since geckos can live for 6 to 10 years, they\u2019ll grow anywhere from 1,800 to 4,000 teeth in a lifetime! It\u2019s all thanks to a special type of cell in their gums, called stem cells.\n\nStem cells are handy because they can morph into different cells when needed. Like tooth stem cells to build new teeth. Humans have these stem cells when we\u2019re younger. But after our adult teeth grow in, the stem cells die and disappear.\n\nTo understand why, let\u2019s take a journey back in time. To about 320 million years ago, when mammals and reptiles split off. In addition to the many obvious differences another change that eventually emerged was tooth shape. Reptiles, for example, are what\u2019s called generalists. Meaning they eat the animals they can get their teeth on. And for that, they needed teeth with the same size and shape, to keep prey from escaping their mouths. Mammals, on the other hand, developed more specific diets. Like grazers who only eat grass and hunters who rip flesh from their kills. As a result, mammals evolved different shaped teeth for different purposes. And it\u2019s this difference, that could also explain why most mammals can\u2019t regrow more teeth.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say you could regrow your molars multiple times, for example. It\u2019s important that the top and bottoms sets match up. Otherwise, they can\u2019t grind up food as efficiently. It sounds good in principle, but with each new set, there\u2019s a risk that the regrown teeth won\u2019t line up. So the leading theory is that adult humans can\u2019t regrow our teeth because it was better for survival to only grow one, well-aligned adult set.\n\nHowever, if you still wish you could regrow a tooth, there may be a way in the future. Using lasers and drugs, scientists have helped rats and mice regrow damaged tissue in cavity-ridden teeth. With the idea that if you can regrow tooth tissue, you can eventually regrow entire teeth.\n\nThough no human testing has been done, yet. So continue to see your dentist! At least for the time being.\n\nMORE HEALTH SCIENCE CONTENT:\nHow Humans Are Trying To Live Forever\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_KxrvKkSRc\nWhy Stubbing Your Toe Hurts So Much\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgdG7gK4eXk\nThe Dangerous Chemicals In Your Plastic Packages\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6R0fhGtHQ\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Humans #Teeth #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy Humans Can't Regrow Teeth",

In addition to the many obvious differences another change that eventually emerged was tooth shape. Reptiles, for example, are what\u2019s called generalists. Meaning they eat the animals they can get their teeth on. And for that, they needed teeth with the same size and shape, to keep prey from escaping their mouths. Mammals, on the other hand, developed more specific diets. Like grazers who only eat grass and hunters who rip flesh from their kills. As a result, mammals evolved different shaped teeth for different purposes. And it\u2019s this difference, that could also explain why most mammals can\u2019t regrow more teeth.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say you could regrow your molars multiple times, for example. It\u2019s important that the top and bottoms sets match up. Otherwise, they can\u2019t grind up food as efficiently. It sounds good in principle, but with each new set, there\u2019s a risk that the regrown teeth won\u2019t line up. So the leading theory is that adult humans can\u2019t regrow our teeth because it was better for survival to only grow one, well-aligned adult set.\n\nHowever, if you still wish you could regrow a tooth, there may be a way in the future. Using lasers and drugs, scientists have helped rats and mice regrow damaged tissue in cavity-ridden teeth. With the idea that if you can regrow tooth tissue, you can eventually regrow entire teeth.\n\nThough no human testing has been done, yet. So continue to see your dentist! At least for the time being.\n\nMORE HEALTH SCIENCE CONTENT:\nHow Humans Are Trying To Live Forever\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_KxrvKkSRc\nWhy Stubbing Your Toe Hurts So Much\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgdG7gK4eXk\nThe Dangerous Chemicals In Your Plastic Packages\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6R0fhGtHQ\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Humans #Teeth #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy Humans Can't Regrow Teeth"

And what about immortality? Well, even that\u2019s not out of the question.\n\nHistory is littered with unusual attempts to defy death. In 1920, for example, a Russian scientist thought he could prolong life by sewing a piece of monkey testicle to a human\u2019s. And even more shockingly, the idea caught on.

An ultramarathon is any race longer than 42 kilometers.\u00a0Races can range anywhere from 50 to over 4,000 kilometers.\u00a0But one of the more common lengths covers about 100 kilometers and takes, on average, 17 hours to finish. \n\nIn some of the longer races, half of the runners never see the finish line.\u00a0Because these races not only push you to your mental limit\u00a0they take a toll on your body both inside and out. \n\nUltra runners endure pretty extreme conditions. The Badwater Ultramarathon, for example, covers over 4,000 meters of elevation through Death Valley, in July, one of the hottest months of the year. Temperatures reach up to 47 degrees Celsius, causing headaches and dizziness in many runners.\n\nBut even if you\u2019re running in more comfortable weather, you could be feeling sick to your stomach. One of the most common issues in any ultramarathon is nausea and/or vomiting. It affects about 37% of people who complete a race, but it\u2019s also the number one reason runners won\u2019t finish in the first place.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s because running disrupts your digestion. \u00a0It diverts blood away from your stomach to your muscles. And since ultramarathons last so long, many races provide sandwiches, pasta, and other carb-loaded meals. As a result, that food will sit around undigested, causing problems.\u00a0But if your stomach isn\u2019t slowing you down, your eyes could be causing you grief.\n\nWindy conditions can dry out or damage the cells that pump a protective liquid layer over your cornea, which can cause your cornea to swell up and blur your vision. During the Hellgate 100K for example, runners report losing most of their vision by the end.\u00a0They call it \u201cHellgate Eyes.\u201d\n\nBut no amount of protection or preparation can prevent one symptom: Sleepiness.\u00a0For a 17-hour race, it might not be so bad. But longer races can stretch to more than 24 hours, which can make sleepy runners more prone to trips and falls or worse, hallucinations.\n\nThe Barkley Marathons, for example, is a race where runners are given 60 hours to finish 161 km.\u00a0In 2005, one runner reported that he thought he saw houses at the top of the mountain and believed he was their garbageman sent to pick up the trash.\n\nDespite all these health hazards, ultrarunning is a growing sport.\u00a0One study found that compared to marathoners, ultrarunners are more likely to do it for nature and a sense of purpose than for the competitive aspect.\u00a0So if you\u2019re up for the challenge, plenty of races are on trails through natural areas, so at least you\u2019ll get a great view!\n\nMORE HEALTH SCIENCE CONTENT:\nWhat Happens To Your Brain And Body When You Do Yoga Regularly\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cEdwIeLd1A\nWhat Happens To Your Body When You Drink Too Much Coffee\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_6_6TAuoGc\nHow Sumo Wrestlers Stay Healthy On 7,000 Calories A Day\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT7HdGFBP-s\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Marathon #Exercise #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happens To Your Body During An Ultramarathon",

                "description": "Babies less than one-year-old can get seriously sick from eating honey. Honey contains C. botulinum bacteria, which can produce a toxin in a baby\u2019s large intestine, leading to a rare but serious illness known as \u201cinfant botulism.\u201d Fortunately, infant botulism is not very common, and infant botulism due to honey is even rarer. But the FDA recommends waiting until your baby is one year old to feed them the sweet treat.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nWhile most adults can eat honey without problems, it\u2019s a different story for babies less than one-year-old. Honey contains C. botulinum bacteria, which can produce a toxin in a baby\u2019s large intestine, leading to a rare but serious illness known as \u201cinfant botulism.\u201d\n\nThis is C. botulinum. It\u2019s a bacterium that can produce one of the world\u2019s most lethal substances. It lives in lots of places including the soil, pollen, dust, and also right here: in honey.\n\nSo why haven't you died from eating this sweet treat? Well, because you\u2019re not a baby. As C. botulinum grows, it produces a toxin called botulinum. It's the same stuff used in Botox. But Botox has an extremely low dose compared to infected food. In large amounts, the toxin would attack your nervous system causing the illness known as botulism.\n\nWhich can lead to paralysis and even death. And since C. botulinum is so common in our environment, researchers believe that bees pick it up on their way to the hive, where they produce honey.\n\nOne study found C. botulinum bacteria in about 8% of their honey samples. But before you purge your pantry, consider this: Normally when we encounter C. botulinum, like in honey, it\u2019s dormant. And in this sleepy state, it can\u2019t produce the toxin. Even if you eat it. That is, unless you\u2019re less than 1 year old.\n\nWhen C. botulinum enters a baby\u2019s large intestine, it comes alive. Because, unlike children and adults, babies less than one year old haven\u2019t been eating real, solid foods.\n\nInstead, they drink milk. But when babies are around 4 to 6 months old, they stop drinking human milk and they start eating other foods they\u2019ve never had before. As a result, their gut microbes change very abruptly. And it\u2019s during this transition period in the baby\u2019s gut, that the lethal C. botulinum bacteria are free to grow and produce the toxin.\n\nAs the toxin enters the baby\u2019s bloodstream, it blocks the ability of motor nerves to release acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that sends nerve signals to muscles. As a result, the baby starts to lose control of muscles and appears tired and floppy. As more toxin enters the bloodstream, the muscles that control swallowing and breathing stop working.\n\nFortunately, infant botulism is not very common, and infant botulism due to honey is even rarer. Fewer than 100 cases occur in the US each year, and while it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the source of the bacterium in many cases, experts think honey accounts for 15% of cases. \n\nSo it\u2019s important that if your infant shows signs of weakness, you take them to be evaluated by medical professionals immediately, in some cases, doctors can administer an effective antitoxin. But it can take babies weeks to a month to recover. The FDA recommends waiting until your baby\u2019s first birthday to feed them honey or any products that are filled or dipped in honey.\n\nMORE HEALTH SCIENCE CONTENT:\nA Dietitian Explains Which Non-Dairy Milks Are Best For You\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNw3qsZ55JE\nThe Real Reason You Should Never Eat Raw Cookie Dough\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXXa7mfyto\nWhy It\u2019s OK To Eat A Brown Avocado\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBHylQFplHg\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Babies #Honey #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy Babies Can't Eat Honey",

                "description": "The market for nondairy milks like soy and almond has exploded in the last several years, growing 62 percent between 2012 and 2018. That\u2019s great for the roughly five billion people who are lactose intolerant. But with so many varieties now crowding the dairy aisle, it\u2019s hard to know which one to choose. We brought a registered dietitian into our studios to tell us which ones are better for you.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nGroetch: The rice milk and the coconut milk and the almond milk are very low in protein. So if you're looking to get a protein source like a vegetarian or plant-based protein source, these are not very good. \n\nNarrator: That's registered dietician Marion Groetch. Today she's gonna help us sort through all of these different non-dairy milks and tell us which ones might just be better for you. \n\nIn the last several years, the market for non-dairy milks has exploded, and that's great for the some 65% of adults who are lactose intolerant, but with more than a dozen varieties now crowding the dairy aisle, it's hard to know which one to choose. Ultimately, Groetch says, it comes down to what you're looking for. \n\nGroetch: So if you're looking to get closest to cow's milk, I would probably go with a soy milk just because it has more protein. It has about seven grams of protein per cup as opposed to eight grams in cow's milk, and then oat milk is somewhere in between. About four grams of protein per cup of oat milk. Soy is high in protein because it comes from a bean, whereas oat comes from a grain, and it tends to have less protein in it. The protein in the soy milk is also more complete. If you're looking to reduce your calories, almond milk might be a good choice. So the rice milk here is higher in calories or the highest in calories, and then we have oat, soy, coconut, and almond milk is usually the lowest in calories. \n\nNarrator: But if you're trying to watch your fat intake, you might actually want to avoid coconut milk. \n\nGroetch: So soy has about four grams of fat per cup, and again, these are healthier fats than the fats that you might find in a 2% milk, but it's equivalent in the amount of fat. Oat milk, about three grams. It depends on the brand. Coconut milk is a little bit higher. It's about six grams of fat. I don't really see the benefit to coconut milk. It's higher in saturated fats, although now we know that the saturated fat in coconut is probably not as detrimental to cardiovascular health as we once thought, but I think the jury is still out, and I wouldn't be taking a lot of saturated fats from coconut products right now. \n\nNarrator: But when you're choosing which milk to buy, there's more to consider than just protein, calories, and fat. \n\nGroetch: Most of them are fortified with vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin B12, but you have to purchase a fortified milk. So some are fortifying up to 45% of the daily value for calcium, whereas others are only fortifying up to 10%. So this rice milk is fortified with 30% of the daily value. So the daily value for calcium is 1,000 milligrams, and that covers most people. So 30% per cup would mean 300 milligrams of calcium per cup, and that's equivalent to cow's milk. Coconut milk, actually, is only fortified at 10%. So you'd only get 100 milligrams of calcium per cup. So it would be difficult to meet your calcium needs if you're relying on a product like this for calcium. They're mostly not fortified with other nutrients like potassium. Soy milk, actually, is a good source of potassium, but some of the others are not. So it really just depends on the milk and how it's fortified. It depends on the brand. \n\nNarrator: And that's just it. Nutrients don't just vary by type of milk, like almond or soy, but by brand, like Blue Diamond or Silk, and so do calories and fat. So the best way to choose the right milk is simple. Check out the label.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Dairy #Milk #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Best Vegan Milks, According To A Dietitian",

                    "title": "The Best Vegan Milks, According To A Dietitian",
                    "description": "The market for nondairy milks like soy and almond has exploded in the last several years, growing 62 percent between 2012 and 2018. That\u2019s great for the roughly five billion people who are lactose intolerant. But with so many varieties now crowding the dairy aisle, it\u2019s hard to know which one to choose. We brought a registered dietitian into our studios to tell us which ones are better for you.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nGroetch: The rice milk and the coconut milk and the almond milk are very low in protein. So if you're looking to get a protein source like a vegetarian or plant-based protein source, these are not very good. \n\nNarrator: That's registered dietician Marion Groetch. Today she's gonna help us sort through all of these different non-dairy milks and tell us which ones might just be better for you. \n\nIn the last several years, the market for non-dairy milks has exploded, and that's great for the some 65% of adults who are lactose intolerant, but with more than a dozen varieties now crowding the dairy aisle, it's hard to know which one to choose. Ultimately, Groetch says, it comes down to what you're looking for. \n\nGroetch: So if you're looking to get closest to cow's milk, I would probably go with a soy milk just because it has more protein. It has about seven grams of protein per cup as opposed to eight grams in cow's milk, and then oat milk is somewhere in between. About four grams of protein per cup of oat milk. Soy is high in protein because it comes from a bean, whereas oat comes from a grain, and it tends to have less protein in it. The protein in the soy milk is also more complete. If you're looking to reduce your calories, almond milk might be a good choice. So the rice milk here is higher in calories or the highest in calories, and then we have oat, soy, coconut, and almond milk is usually the lowest in calories. \n\nNarrator: But if you're trying to watch your fat intake, you might actually want to avoid coconut milk. \n\nGroetch: So soy has about four grams of fat per cup, and again, these are healthier fats than the fats that you might find in a 2% milk, but it's equivalent in the amount of fat. Oat milk, about three grams. It depends on the brand. Coconut milk is a little bit higher. It's about six grams of fat. I don't really see the benefit to coconut milk. It's higher in saturated fats, although now we know that the saturated fat in coconut is probably not as detrimental to cardiovascular health as we once thought, but I think the jury is still out, and I wouldn't be taking a lot of saturated fats from coconut products right now. \n\nNarrator: But when you're choosing which milk to buy, there's more to consider than just protein, calories, and fat. \n\nGroetch: Most of them are fortified with vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin B12, but you have to purchase a fortified milk. So some are fortifying up to 45% of the daily value for calcium, whereas others are only fortifying up to 10%. So this rice milk is fortified with 30% of the daily value. So the daily value for calcium is 1,000 milligrams, and that covers most people. So 30% per cup would mean 300 milligrams of calcium per cup, and that's equivalent to cow's milk. Coconut milk, actually, is only fortified at 10%. So you'd only get 100 milligrams of calcium per cup. So it would be difficult to meet your calcium needs if you're relying on a product like this for calcium. They're mostly not fortified with other nutrients like potassium. Soy milk, actually, is a good source of potassium, but some of the others are not. So it really just depends on the milk and how it's fortified. It depends on the brand. \n\nNarrator: And that's just it. Nutrients don't just vary by type of milk, like almond or soy, but by brand, like Blue Diamond or Silk, and so do calories and fat. So the best way to choose the right milk is simple. Check out the label.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Dairy #Milk #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Best Vegan Milks, According To A Dietitian"

                "description": "Sumo wrestlers eat up to 7,000 calories a day and weigh as much as 400 pounds. Yet they don\u2019t suffer from heart attacks, strokes, or other symptoms of obesity. Their secret is in their name\u2014sumo wrestler. Regular intense exercise prevents the build-up of visceral fat, which causes metabolic and cardiovascular disease.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nSumo wrestlers eat up to 7,000 calories a day and weigh 300 to 400 pounds or two to three times as much as the average adult.\n\nWhile that may not sound like the healthiest lifestyle, you shouldn't judge a book, or a body, by its cover. Take a closer look, and you'll discover that it really is what's on the inside that counts.\n\nNormally, people with obesity store a portion of their extra fat deep inside the abdomen, where it wraps around the pancreas, liver, and other vital organs. We call this visceral fat. It pollutes the blood with molecules that can cause inflammation, and this is why obesity can lead to health issues like high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, and heart attacks.\n\nBut sumo wrestlers don't usually suffer from these symptoms. So what's their trick? CT scans reveal that sumo wrestlers don't have much visceral fat at all. Instead, they store most of their fat right underneath the skin. That's why scientists think sumo wrestlers are healthy. They have normal levels of triglycerides, a type of fat in their blood, and unexpectedly low levels of cholesterol, both of which lower their risk of heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.\n\nSo how did they hit the jackpot on fat? The secret's in their name: sumo wrestler. Studies show that intense exercise may prevent the buildup of visceral fat. Basically, it has to do with how exercise increases a hormone called adiponectin. Adiponectin guides glucose and fat molecules out of our blood stream, where they could build up as visceral fat, and instead puts them underneath the skin.\n\nMind you, sumo wrestlers get a lot of exercise. At a sumo stable, or heya, in Japan, training starts as early as 5 a.m. and can last for up to five hours straight, and it's nothing like what you'd expect to find at your typical group fitness class. For example, during an exercise called butsukari-geiko, wrestlers take turns repeatedly hitting and pushing each other until they collapse to the floor from exhaustion. And then, of course, there's the match, where wrestlers try to shove their opponent out of the ring or force them to touch the ground with any body part other than the soles of their feet.\n\nBut as soon as the exercise stops, so does its benefits. When sumo wrestlers retire, they have to seriously cut calories or they become at risk for cardiovascular disease. That might explain why retired wrestlers reportedly die an estimated 10 years younger than the average Japanese citizen. So while the thought of eating 7,000 calories a day might be appealing, you probably shouldn't. Unless you're spending most of your day trying to topple a 400-pound man.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Sumo #Wrestlers #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Sumo Wrestlers Stay Healthy On 7,000 Calories A Day",

                "description": "Over 36 million Americans practice yoga. Studies show it can improve flexibility, which in turn can help treat and prevent back pain. Yoga has also been shown to lower inflammation, which is linked to serious issues like cardiovascular disease and cancer. Studies also suggest it might reduce stress by interfering with your brain\u2019s ability to release stress hormones.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nOver 36 million Americans practice yoga, which really can have profound health effects on your body and brain. Studies show yoga can improve flexibility, which in turn can prevent and treat back pain. Not to mention, it lowers inflammation in the body, which has been linked to serious issues like cardiovascular disease. And like other forms of exercise, yoga may reduce stress. \n\nThis year is the year that you start doing yoga, and I mean for real this time. You're going to join the 36 million-plus Americans who have taken up this beautiful practice, connecting yourself with a millennia-old tradition and helping you flush out those nasty toxins, or, you know, probably not.\n\nBefore you grab a mat, here's what yoga really does to your body and brain. First of all, yoga comes in many, many different styles, but generally speaking, it involves some amount of stretching and meditation. Now, despite what you may have read, there's no scientific evidence to support the idea that yoga will flush out toxins from your colon or anywhere else. But that doesn't mean these techniques can't help your body in many other ways.\n\nTake back pain for instance. An estimated 80% of Americans will suffer from back pain at one point in their lives. But one study found that after just six to 12 yoga sessions, participants reported significantly less pain in their lower back. That's because certain yoga poses stretch out your hamstrings, which, when they're too tight, can yank on your hip flexors and strain your lower back. But the more you practice yoga, the more flexible your hamstrings get.\n\nFor example, in a 2015 study, women practiced a type of hatha yoga, which involves positions like downward dog and triangle pose. They practiced 90 minutes each week for around 16 weeks straight. And by the last week, they could reach four centimeters closer to their toes than before thanks to those loose hamstrings. Now, if you're also meditating during those yoga sessions, the flexibility might not be the only benefit. After seven to 16 weeks of meditative activities, participants in one study saw a huge drop in C-reactive proteins in their blood. Those proteins are linked to inflammation, which, when you're overly stressed, can kick into overdrive. And over time, that inflammation may contribute to serious illnesses like cardiovascular disease and cancer. That's where yoga's meditative qualities can help.\n\nResearchers suspect that yoga may reduce stress by interfering with the central nervous system's ability to release stress hormones. Plus, studies show that meditation-focused types of yoga, like yoga asana, boost levels of feel-good hormones like oxytocin in the brain. Plus, yoga is an exercise, and exercise in and of itself is a stress reliever. In fact, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends two and a half to five hours a week of light to moderate exercise.\n\nThat can include workouts like yoga, brisk walking, or swimming. And to be fair, any amount of regular exercise is most likely going to reduce anxiety, elevate mood, and improve sleep and self-esteem. So while yoga might have an edge in the flexibility department and mindfulness department, there are plenty of other activities you can try to get fit. But as long as it gets you moving and maybe gives you some new friends, why not give it a try?\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Yoga #Meditation #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happens To Your Brain And Body When You Do Yoga Regularly",

                    "description": "Over 36 million Americans practice yoga. Studies show it can improve flexibility, which in turn can help treat and prevent back pain. Yoga has also been shown to lower inflammation, which is linked to serious issues like cardiovascular disease and cancer. Studies also suggest it might reduce stress by interfering with your brain\u2019s ability to release stress hormones.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nOver 36 million Americans practice yoga, which really can have profound health effects on your body and brain. Studies show yoga can improve flexibility, which in turn can prevent and treat back pain. Not to mention, it lowers inflammation in the body, which has been linked to serious issues like cardiovascular disease. And like other forms of exercise, yoga may reduce stress. \n\nThis year is the year that you start doing yoga, and I mean for real this time. You're going to join the 36 million-plus Americans who have taken up this beautiful practice, connecting yourself with a millennia-old tradition and helping you flush out those nasty toxins, or, you know, probably not.\n\nBefore you grab a mat, here's what yoga really does to your body and brain. First of all, yoga comes in many, many different styles, but generally speaking, it involves some amount of stretching and meditation. Now, despite what you may have read, there's no scientific evidence to support the idea that yoga will flush out toxins from your colon or anywhere else. But that doesn't mean these techniques can't help your body in many other ways.\n\nTake back pain for instance. An estimated 80% of Americans will suffer from back pain at one point in their lives. But one study found that after just six to 12 yoga sessions, participants reported significantly less pain in their lower back. That's because certain yoga poses stretch out your hamstrings, which, when they're too tight, can yank on your hip flexors and strain your lower back. But the more you practice yoga, the more flexible your hamstrings get.\n\nFor example, in a 2015 study, women practiced a type of hatha yoga, which involves positions like downward dog and triangle pose. They practiced 90 minutes each week for around 16 weeks straight. And by the last week, they could reach four centimeters closer to their toes than before thanks to those loose hamstrings. Now, if you're also meditating during those yoga sessions, the flexibility might not be the only benefit. After seven to 16 weeks of meditative activities, participants in one study saw a huge drop in C-reactive proteins in their blood. Those proteins are linked to inflammation, which, when you're overly stressed, can kick into overdrive. And over time, that inflammation may contribute to serious illnesses like cardiovascular disease and cancer. That's where yoga's meditative qualities can help.\n\nResearchers suspect that yoga may reduce stress by interfering with the central nervous system's ability to release stress hormones. Plus, studies show that meditation-focused types of yoga, like yoga asana, boost levels of feel-good hormones like oxytocin in the brain. Plus, yoga is an exercise, and exercise in and of itself is a stress reliever. In fact, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends two and a half to five hours a week of light to moderate exercise.\n\nThat can include workouts like yoga, brisk walking, or swimming. And to be fair, any amount of regular exercise is most likely going to reduce anxiety, elevate mood, and improve sleep and self-esteem. So while yoga might have an edge in the flexibility department and mindfulness department, there are plenty of other activities you can try to get fit. But as long as it gets you moving and maybe gives you some new friends, why not give it a try?\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Yoga #Meditation #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nBusiness Insider/Tech Insider on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happens To Your Brain And Body When You Do Yoga Regularly"

                "description": "It\u2019s almost impossible to overdose on coffee. The average American drinks 3 cups of coffee per day and there is a lethal dose of caffeine, but it\u2019s somewhere around 10 grams. And the average cup of joe has around 100 milligrams.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nBenji: This is me and I love coffee. The intoxicating nutty aroma. The rich chocolatey taste.\n\nSome days I drink three cups like the average American I am. Other days, I drink more like five or six. But is that too much? First the good news. It's almost impossible to overdose on coffee.\n\nThere is a lethal dose of caffeine but it's somewhere around 10 grams and the average cup of Joe has around 100 milligrams. You'd likely have to drink 100 cups in rapid succession to OD. But that's not to say there's no such thing as too much. The FDA recommends no more than four to five cups a day for the average healthy adult. More than that and you might start to experience some nasty side effects.\n\nMost people take in coffee to increase their focus and concentration, but once you take in too much, you start to lose that focus. People start getting more agitated, irritable.\n\nBenji: That's thanks to the hormone, adrenaline. When caffeine hits your system it stimulates your adrenal glands which release the hormone into your body. It makes you feel energetic and alert. Perfect for a fight or flight situation. But too much can be a bad thing. Especially if you suffer from anxiety.\n\nDr. Albert Ahn: But with anxiety you also wanna be careful not to overstimulate or trigger any sort of panic attacks and make anxiety worse, which certainly too much caffeine can do.\n\nBenji: Adrenaline from caffeine can also increase your heart rate. That's why doctors also recommend against drinking coffee if your heart sometimes beats irregularly. But the risk is really only for bonafide coffee junkies. According to at least two observational studies you have to drink at least nine cups of coffee a day to put yourself at risk of arrhythmia. And finally, there's the question of sleep. Coffee's enemy.\n\nCaffeine launches a double threat on your slumber. It blocks the neurochemical adenosine which is what tells your brain that you're tired. It releases a cocktail of stimulants into your brain. Adrenaline, dopamine, and glutamate. So after downing your sixth cup of coffee, you don't just feel awake but full of energy. It will power you through that 2:30 meeting or the last class of the day. But if you overdo it, the effect won't wear off when it's time for bed.\n\nIn one study, researchers monitored the sleep of a dozen volunteers. Some were given a caffeine pill equivalent to about four cups of coffee and others received a placebo instead. Even when the volunteers swallowed the caffeine pills six hours before bedtime, they spent significantly less time in the light stages of sleep. And that can have detrimental effects on daytime function, the authors report.\n\nDr. Albert Ahn: It's sort of just stuck in this loop where you're not sleeping because you drink too much coffee and then you wake up in the morning and you're not well rested and you're drinking more coffee just to stay awake in the day.\n\nBenji:\u00a0Sound familiar? Here's the good news. If you cut yourself off by 2:00 you typically won't have trouble falling asleep. That's because the half-life of caffeine is around five hours. And so most of its stimulating effects will wear off well before the lights go out. And if you also limit your consumption, well then coffee can actually offer a number of health benefits. Research shows that it can help with everything from memory, to exercise, to your relationships with your colleagues. And that's great because for some of us, coffee is something we'll just never give up.\n\nMORE HEALTH SCIENCE CONTENT:\nWhy Stubbing Your Toe Hurts So Much\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgdG7gK4eXk\nThe Real Reason You Should Never Eat Raw Cookie Dough\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXXa7mfyto\nWhy It\u2019s OK To Eat A Brown Avocado\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBHylQFplHg\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Coffee #Caffeine #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happens To Your Body When You Drink Too Much Coffee",

                "channelId": "UC9uD-W5zQHQuAVT2GdcLCvg",
                "description": "Plastic is everywhere. In grocery receipts, water bottles, and of course, food packaging. And that means that chemicals in plastic like BPA and phthalates are everywhere too. Researchers are concerned that these chemicals can leach into food and get into your body, which might have serious health consequences.\n\nTo learn more, check out Bruce Blumberg\u2019s \"The Obesogen Effect:\"\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Obesogen-Effect-Exercise-Struggle-Weight/dp/1478970642\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nNarrator: There's been a lot of buzz about dubious chemicals in the environment that might contribute to some pretty frightening stuff like obesity, breast cancer, thyroid issues. And they seem to lurk everywhere: in pesticides, cosmetics, and especially plastic packaging. In light of this, it's understandable to start panicking. But before you do, let's hear what molecular biologist Bruce Blumberg has to say on the subject. He's been studying the link between synthetic chemicals and obesity for around 15 years. So he might be able to give us a better idea of what's really going on and what to do about it.\n\nBad news is, Blumberg confirmed that, yep, we're surrounded by these chemicals. One of the most well known is BPA, or Bisphenol A, which shows up in water bottles, cans, milk cartons, and more.\n\nBruce Blumberg: You get them from thermal paper receipts. Like I have, I have these receipts from a recent trip. All of these things are coated with Bisphenol A. It goes right into your skin.\n\nNarrator: BPA has been making headlines for years about whether or not it's harming us. And while FDA-funded and independent studies have conflicting conclusions, the bigger heart of the issue is this: BPA is hard to get away from because it's a key building block in the tough, clear, flexible plastic called polycarbonate. And that proximity to food is what concerns scientists like Blumberg.\n\nBruce Blumberg: You don't want to store food in plastics because some fraction of those plastics will leach into your food.\n\nNarrator: The BPA molecules that make up plastic are bound together by what's called an ester bond, which is extremely sensitive to heat. So when you heat up your food in plastic, that heat breaks some of the bonds, releasing the chemicals into your food. A survey by the CDC of 2,517 people estimated that over 90% of Americans have detectable levels of BPA in their urine. And BPA isn't alone. Phthalates, which make plastic flexible, can also leach into food when heated.\n\nAnd reviews of hundreds of studies have linked BPA and phthalates to heart disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. Not to mention a 2015 review linked phthalates with impaired neurological development in children, which in 2018 prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to announce that families should avoid plastic food containers entirely. And other studies on animals, like mice and monkeys, have shown that these chemicals can lead to problems in the lungs, brains, and reproductive organs.\n\nThis is about the time someone like me would probably panic. But there are ways you can avoid these chemicals. Blumberg suggests it's best to just stick to heating your food in anything but plastic. Now, quick aside, BPA-free plastic containers aren't the answer because research suggests that BPS and BPF, the most common replacements for BPA, might have similar effects on your body. Instead, opt for replacements like ceramic or glass containers.\n\nBruce Blumberg: You have to do the best you can, and it makes sense to me to do the things that give you the most return for the least effort.\n\nNarrator: And here's the best part. Once you reduce exposure, those chemicals slowly leave your body. As Blumberg says, they're stored in fat cells, which eventually die and ultimately leave your system.\n\nBruce Blumberg: Don't stress about it, right? Do your best and make conscious choices to improve things.\n\nMORE HEALTH SCIENCE CONTENT:\nThe Dirtiest Places In Your Home\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04sFxbqf6Sk\nThe Real Reason You Should Never Eat Raw Cookie Dough\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXXa7mfyto\nIs Eating Boogers Actually Unhealthy?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb3wFkWtgRk\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Plastic #BPA #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Dangerous Chemicals In Your Plastic Packages",

                    "description": "Plastic is everywhere. In grocery receipts, water bottles, and of course, food packaging. And that means that chemicals in plastic like BPA and phthalates are everywhere too. Researchers are concerned that these chemicals can leach into food and get into your body, which might have serious health consequences.\n\nTo learn more, check out Bruce Blumberg\u2019s \"The Obesogen Effect:\"\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Obesogen-Effect-Exercise-Struggle-Weight/dp/1478970642\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nNarrator: There's been a lot of buzz about dubious chemicals in the environment that might contribute to some pretty frightening stuff like obesity, breast cancer, thyroid issues. And they seem to lurk everywhere: in pesticides, cosmetics, and especially plastic packaging. In light of this, it's understandable to start panicking. But before you do, let's hear what molecular biologist Bruce Blumberg has to say on the subject. He's been studying the link between synthetic chemicals and obesity for around 15 years. So he might be able to give us a better idea of what's really going on and what to do about it.\n\nBad news is, Blumberg confirmed that, yep, we're surrounded by these chemicals. One of the most well known is BPA, or Bisphenol A, which shows up in water bottles, cans, milk cartons, and more.\n\nBruce Blumberg: You get them from thermal paper receipts. Like I have, I have these receipts from a recent trip. All of these things are coated with Bisphenol A. It goes right into your skin.\n\nNarrator: BPA has been making headlines for years about whether or not it's harming us. And while FDA-funded and independent studies have conflicting conclusions, the bigger heart of the issue is this: BPA is hard to get away from because it's a key building block in the tough, clear, flexible plastic called polycarbonate. And that proximity to food is what concerns scientists like Blumberg.\n\nBruce Blumberg: You don't want to store food in plastics because some fraction of those plastics will leach into your food.\n\nNarrator: The BPA molecules that make up plastic are bound together by what's called an ester bond, which is extremely sensitive to heat. So when you heat up your food in plastic, that heat breaks some of the bonds, releasing the chemicals into your food. A survey by the CDC of 2,517 people estimated that over 90% of Americans have detectable levels of BPA in their urine. And BPA isn't alone. Phthalates, which make plastic flexible, can also leach into food when heated.\n\nAnd reviews of hundreds of studies have linked BPA and phthalates to heart disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. Not to mention a 2015 review linked phthalates with impaired neurological development in children, which in 2018 prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to announce that families should avoid plastic food containers entirely. And other studies on animals, like mice and monkeys, have shown that these chemicals can lead to problems in the lungs, brains, and reproductive organs.\n\nThis is about the time someone like me would probably panic. But there are ways you can avoid these chemicals. Blumberg suggests it's best to just stick to heating your food in anything but plastic. Now, quick aside, BPA-free plastic containers aren't the answer because research suggests that BPS and BPF, the most common replacements for BPA, might have similar effects on your body. Instead, opt for replacements like ceramic or glass containers.\n\nBruce Blumberg: You have to do the best you can, and it makes sense to me to do the things that give you the most return for the least effort.\n\nNarrator: And here's the best part. Once you reduce exposure, those chemicals slowly leave your body. As Blumberg says, they're stored in fat cells, which eventually die and ultimately leave your system.\n\nBruce Blumberg: Don't stress about it, right? Do your best and make conscious choices to improve things.\n\nMORE HEALTH SCIENCE CONTENT:\nThe Dirtiest Places In Your Home\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04sFxbqf6Sk\nThe Real Reason You Should Never Eat Raw Cookie Dough\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXXa7mfyto\nIs Eating Boogers Actually Unhealthy?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb3wFkWtgRk\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Plastic #BPA #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Dangerous Chemicals In Your Plastic Packages"

                "description": "The longest-living goldfish on record was 43 years old. But while they're supposed to live at least 15 years on average, yours might not have made it to its 5th birthday. The major problem is often toxin accumulation in the tank from fish poop. By seeding the tank with special bacteria, you can break these chemicals down and make the aquarium a safer home for your pet. \n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nThe longest-living goldfish on record was 43 years old. But chances are your goldfish didn't even live a quarter that long. In fact, most goldfish don't survive past their fifth birthday, and that's a major problem since they're supposed to live for about as long as your cat. So why are goldfish dying so young? \n\nThe usual culprit behind your goldfish's untimely demise is, well, poop. You see, goldfish waste contains toxins like ammonia that can burn gills and even damage the brain. In the wild, this isn't a problem. Freshwater lakes and ponds are home to armies of bacteria that break it down into less harmful chemicals. But in your home tank, there's no bacteria to be found. You have to introduce it, and that's where a lot of goldfish owners slip up because you can't just buy a fish the same day you get your tank. The process of growing bacteria takes patience. \n\nFirst, you'll need to remove chlorine from your tank water using a conditioner. Chlorinated tap water is fine for you to drink since it kills off germs, but it's not so great for the bacteria you want to cultivate. Once you've created a safe space for the bacteria to grow, they'll come from all over: the air, the outside of the tank, and any rocks or plants you stick in the tank for decoration. You can also buy commercially sold bacteria cultures grown in labs. After that, all they need is dinner. Fish food will do. As the food breaks down, it releases ammonia for the bacteria to eat, and finally, you wait for a while. Depending on how much bacteria you start with, the process can take about two months. That's right, two months. But then there should be enough bacteria. You can double-check with a simple water test kit. \n\nBut here's the thing, all the bacteria in the world won't keep your fish alive if the tank is too small. You see, as these bacteria gobble up goldfish poop, they produce some waste of their own, and if it's not sufficiently diluted, it can kill your goldfish. A dinky, single-gallon bowl is much too small, and even the 10-gallon tank you see in every pet store won't cut it. A single adult goldfish needs at least twice that much water to thrive. That's almost 40 kilograms of water, 2000 times heavier than your goldfish, and even with a huge tank, you'll still need to replace about 30% of the water every two weeks because besides poop, goldfish release hormones and pheromones into their environment, which, if left unchecked, can stunt their growth. That might help explain why goldfish in healthy environments can reach the size of an American football, while your last goldfish wasn't much bigger than your index finger. \n\nOnce you have a big, detoxified tank, Goldie just needs one more thing: your attention. Because you're not swimming in the tank with her, it's hard to notice if something's wrong with, say, the water quality. So oftentimes new goldfish owners don't realize anything's amiss until it's too late, and common diseases like fin rot, white spot disease, and fungal infections have already taken hold. So it's a good idea to pay careful attention to how the water looks and smells, and anyway, spending time with your goldfish will be worth it since you can teach Goldie to swim through hoops and eat from your hand.\n\nFor more information: \nhttp://www.starfisheries.co.uk/\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Goldfish #Fish #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow To Keep Your Goldfish Alive For 15 Years",

                "description": "A number of animals have extreme sex lives compared to a human. Like the male honeybee, whose testicles explode during sex. Or the echidna, who uses his four-headed penis to alternate between spent pairs as each fires their semen.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nThe average couple has sex for anywhere from 30 seconds to about 45 minutes.\u00a0Now, 45 minutes sounds long, until you consider the brown antechinus.\n\nFor two weeks every mating season, a male will mate as much as physically possible, sometimes having sex for up to 14 hours at a time, flitting from one female to the next. And all that testosterone revs up his stress hormone production into overdrive, crashing his immune system.\n\nThat in turn crashes his immune system, making him extremely vulnerable to disease and infection. Often times, he dies before his young are even born. Scientists call this kamikaze mating technique \u201csuicidal reproduction.\u201d It turns out that for many species, sex kills.\n\nTake the male honeybee. His primary job? Mate with the Queen. But sadly for him, he only gets to mate once because during the act, his reproductive organs are ripped off and his testicles explode. In the process, his semen shoots through her oviduct, where she stores it for later use.\n\nHey, at least it's a quick death, especially compared to some deep-sea anglerfish, like the triplewart seadevil. This one\u2019s a female. And you see that tiny parasite on her side? That\u2019s the male. It would be like if a human male only came up to a woman\u2019s ankle. Instead of hunting for his own food, the male bites into the female, fusing his body with hers and living off the nutrients in her blood In return, he provides the one thing he has to offer: sperm.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. In the process, his body shrivels up. He loses his eyes, fins, and most internal organs, until, ultimately, he becomes just a portable sperm bank for the female.\n\nFortunately, not all males have it that rough. The short-beaked echidna survives mating. But his sex life is anything but ordinary. He\u2019ll line up with around 9 other males and follow a single female for up to a month during mating season. But here\u2019s the interesting part. Females have a forked reproductive tract. But that doesn\u2019t deter the males, because they have a 4-headed penis.\n\nSo during sex, the male alternates, swapping out spent pairs as each fires its semen. And that semen is supercharged. Hundreds of sperm glom together into bundles, which can swim faster than individual sperm, increasing their chance of fertilization. If that\u2019s not impressive enough, his penis reaches nearly a quarter of his body length when erect.\n\nBut that\u2019s nothing compared to a barnacle\u2019s. That little crustacean has proportionally the longest penis of any animal on earth spanning up to 10 times his body size. That\u2019s like a human\u2019s reaching the length of a bowling lane. And the barnacle needs it because he can\u2019t move around very easily. So he casts out his giant penis like a fishing line to find a mate. It waves about in the current, reaching to touch, and fertilize, the female organs of its neighbor.\n\nBee or barnacle, reproduction finds creative ways to continue on.\n\nMORE ANIMAL CONTENT:\nWhat's Inside An Elephant Trunk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjpRgi-73bU\nWhy Bed Bugs Are So Hard To Kill\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYACvmm5zAE\nThe Most Impressive Dads In The Animal Kingdom\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN1J-Jeh_AA\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Sex #Animals #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Most Extreme Romances In The Animal Kingdom",

                    "description": "A number of animals have extreme sex lives compared to a human. Like the male honeybee, whose testicles explode during sex. Or the echidna, who uses his four-headed penis to alternate between spent pairs as each fires their semen.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nThe average couple has sex for anywhere from 30 seconds to about 45 minutes.\u00a0Now, 45 minutes sounds long, until you consider the brown antechinus.\n\nFor two weeks every mating season, a male will mate as much as physically possible, sometimes having sex for up to 14 hours at a time, flitting from one female to the next. And all that testosterone revs up his stress hormone production into overdrive, crashing his immune system.\n\nThat in turn crashes his immune system, making him extremely vulnerable to disease and infection. Often times, he dies before his young are even born. Scientists call this kamikaze mating technique \u201csuicidal reproduction.\u201d It turns out that for many species, sex kills.\n\nTake the male honeybee. His primary job? Mate with the Queen. But sadly for him, he only gets to mate once because during the act, his reproductive organs are ripped off and his testicles explode. In the process, his semen shoots through her oviduct, where she stores it for later use.\n\nHey, at least it's a quick death, especially compared to some deep-sea anglerfish, like the triplewart seadevil. This one\u2019s a female. And you see that tiny parasite on her side? That\u2019s the male. It would be like if a human male only came up to a woman\u2019s ankle. Instead of hunting for his own food, the male bites into the female, fusing his body with hers and living off the nutrients in her blood In return, he provides the one thing he has to offer: sperm.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. In the process, his body shrivels up. He loses his eyes, fins, and most internal organs, until, ultimately, he becomes just a portable sperm bank for the female.\n\nFortunately, not all males have it that rough. The short-beaked echidna survives mating. But his sex life is anything but ordinary. He\u2019ll line up with around 9 other males and follow a single female for up to a month during mating season. But here\u2019s the interesting part. Females have a forked reproductive tract. But that doesn\u2019t deter the males, because they have a 4-headed penis.\n\nSo during sex, the male alternates, swapping out spent pairs as each fires its semen. And that semen is supercharged. Hundreds of sperm glom together into bundles, which can swim faster than individual sperm, increasing their chance of fertilization. If that\u2019s not impressive enough, his penis reaches nearly a quarter of his body length when erect.\n\nBut that\u2019s nothing compared to a barnacle\u2019s. That little crustacean has proportionally the longest penis of any animal on earth spanning up to 10 times his body size. That\u2019s like a human\u2019s reaching the length of a bowling lane. And the barnacle needs it because he can\u2019t move around very easily. So he casts out his giant penis like a fishing line to find a mate. It waves about in the current, reaching to touch, and fertilize, the female organs of its neighbor.\n\nBee or barnacle, reproduction finds creative ways to continue on.\n\nMORE ANIMAL CONTENT:\nWhat's Inside An Elephant Trunk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjpRgi-73bU\nWhy Bed Bugs Are So Hard To Kill\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYACvmm5zAE\nThe Most Impressive Dads In The Animal Kingdom\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN1J-Jeh_AA\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Sex #Animals #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Most Extreme Romances In The Animal Kingdom"

Editing human DNA in this way could save lives, but many researchers fear unintended consequences.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nIn 2011, scientists created glow-in-the-dark cats. The researchers took a gene from a glowing jellyfish and inserted it into the unfertilized eggs of house cats. It was a neat trick, but they had a bigger goal in mind.\u00a0They also made the cats more likely to be resistant to a feline form of AIDS by, again, manipulating their DNA.\u00a0And cats aren\u2019t that different than humans. In fact, we share around 90 percent of our DNA with them.\u00a0\n\nSo why can\u2019t we engineer humans in the same way? Well, we can \u2013 engineer ourselves to be resistant to life-threatening illnesses, that is.

But what exactly is a CRISPR baby, anyway? \n\nWould you like to be six feet tall?\u00a0Or never bald?

But what if you could make those mutations simply disappear?\u00a0That\u2019s where the gene-editing tool CRISPR comes in. \n\nCRISPR is made from specialized proteins and other compounds found in certain bacteria.\u00a0Normally, these proteins protect the bacteria by destroying enemy invaders like viruses, but the inventors of CRISPR figured out how to turn those proteins against genetic mutations and other genes linked to disease. \u00a0\n\nFirst, they give the proteins coordinates of the wanted gene.

                "description": "Thousands of species of bug, bacteria, and fungus live in your house. Some fungi live in your air conditioner and get blasted throughout the house. One kind of mycobacteria lives in your shower-head and has been found to reduce stress and increase happiness. Tens of thousands of microbe species live in your body and help keep you healthy.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nYour home is filled with thousands of species of bug, bacteria, fungus. And while you might assume most live in your bathroom, the dirtiest place in your home isn't your toilet. It's your own body. But it turns out, having lots of biodiversity about your person helps keep you healthy.\n\nFace it, your house is filthy.It\u2019s filled with dead skin cells, dust...and around 200,000 different species of bug, bacteria, and fungus. Now, it\u2019s tempting to assume that most of them live in your toilet. After all, it\u2019s where...you know. But here\u2019s the thing: the dirtiest place in your house isn\u2019t your toilet. It\u2019s actually you.\n\nHousehold microbes lurk in the most unlikely of places.Take a heat-loving bacteria called Thermus aquaticus. These guys can only be found in two environments: blisteringly-hot geysers like Old Faithful at Yellowstone and your hot water heater. Another example is Penicillium fungi.They creep into your air-conditioner from outdoors. And when you switch on the AC, their spores get blasted around the house and are known to cause allergies in 2-6% of people. So when you notice a funny, musty smell coming from your AC, it\u2019s probably the fungus. \n\nBut before you start eyeing your central air suspiciously, think about this: you dump microbes all over your body every time you shower. It turns out, trillions of organisms live in your shower head...piled on top of each other in a slimy layer half a millimeter thick. But that\u2019s not necessarily a problem. Researchers found that a type of shower-dwelling mycobacterium actually boosts levels of serotonin. That\u2019s a neurotransmitter thought to lower stress and increase happiness. And when those errant mycobacteria land on you...they join the tens of thousands of other microbe species that live in the dirtiest place around: your body.\n\nLike Corynebacteria \u2014 the microbes that give your armpits that stinky odor\u2026and simultaneously fight off harmful pathogens like E Coli. Meanwhile, 300-500 species of microbe colonize your gut\u2026and are thought to play a role in maintaining your immune system, digestive system, and even mental health.\n\nIn the non-bacteria category of microbes\u2026you\u2019ve got such guests as microscopic mites that live on your face\u2026and mold that colonizes your toes. And while the idea of them might give you chills...microbes like these help keep you safe. You see, the number of harmless microbial species in the world outnumber harmful ones by a trillion to one. In fact, less than .00000001% of microbial species account for nearly all infectious diseases in the world .And all these harmless bacteria crawling on your skin means less room and resources for pathogens, like antibiotic resistant microbes. Which also means they have less opportunity to take over, and make you sick. So, even when antibiotics fail, it could be all those other microbes crawling in and on you that keep you safe.\n\nSo in a way, you need to get a little dirty to stay healthy. But full disclosure: that\u2019s not an excuse to swear off your shower. Besides, you don\u2019t want to miss out on that feel-good mycobacterium! This video was made in large part thanks to Rob Dunn, and the information in his new book, \u201cNever Home Alone.\u201d\n\nMORE SCIENCE CONTENT:\nWhy Lice Are So Hard To Kill\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVh7CuPUQk\nWhy Bed Bugs Are So Hard To Kill\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYACvmm5zAE\nWhy It\u2019s OK To Eat A Brown Avocado\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBHylQFplHg\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Home #Bacteria #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Dirtiest Places In Your Home",

                    "description": "Thousands of species of bug, bacteria, and fungus live in your house. Some fungi live in your air conditioner and get blasted throughout the house. One kind of mycobacteria lives in your shower-head and has been found to reduce stress and increase happiness. Tens of thousands of microbe species live in your body and help keep you healthy.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nYour home is filled with thousands of species of bug, bacteria, fungus. And while you might assume most live in your bathroom, the dirtiest place in your home isn't your toilet. It's your own body. But it turns out, having lots of biodiversity about your person helps keep you healthy.\n\nFace it, your house is filthy.It\u2019s filled with dead skin cells, dust...and around 200,000 different species of bug, bacteria, and fungus. Now, it\u2019s tempting to assume that most of them live in your toilet. After all, it\u2019s where...you know. But here\u2019s the thing: the dirtiest place in your house isn\u2019t your toilet. It\u2019s actually you.\n\nHousehold microbes lurk in the most unlikely of places.Take a heat-loving bacteria called Thermus aquaticus. These guys can only be found in two environments: blisteringly-hot geysers like Old Faithful at Yellowstone and your hot water heater. Another example is Penicillium fungi.They creep into your air-conditioner from outdoors. And when you switch on the AC, their spores get blasted around the house and are known to cause allergies in 2-6% of people. So when you notice a funny, musty smell coming from your AC, it\u2019s probably the fungus. \n\nBut before you start eyeing your central air suspiciously, think about this: you dump microbes all over your body every time you shower. It turns out, trillions of organisms live in your shower head...piled on top of each other in a slimy layer half a millimeter thick. But that\u2019s not necessarily a problem. Researchers found that a type of shower-dwelling mycobacterium actually boosts levels of serotonin. That\u2019s a neurotransmitter thought to lower stress and increase happiness. And when those errant mycobacteria land on you...they join the tens of thousands of other microbe species that live in the dirtiest place around: your body.\n\nLike Corynebacteria \u2014 the microbes that give your armpits that stinky odor\u2026and simultaneously fight off harmful pathogens like E Coli. Meanwhile, 300-500 species of microbe colonize your gut\u2026and are thought to play a role in maintaining your immune system, digestive system, and even mental health.\n\nIn the non-bacteria category of microbes\u2026you\u2019ve got such guests as microscopic mites that live on your face\u2026and mold that colonizes your toes. And while the idea of them might give you chills...microbes like these help keep you safe. You see, the number of harmless microbial species in the world outnumber harmful ones by a trillion to one. In fact, less than .00000001% of microbial species account for nearly all infectious diseases in the world .And all these harmless bacteria crawling on your skin means less room and resources for pathogens, like antibiotic resistant microbes. Which also means they have less opportunity to take over, and make you sick. So, even when antibiotics fail, it could be all those other microbes crawling in and on you that keep you safe.\n\nSo in a way, you need to get a little dirty to stay healthy. But full disclosure: that\u2019s not an excuse to swear off your shower. Besides, you don\u2019t want to miss out on that feel-good mycobacterium! This video was made in large part thanks to Rob Dunn, and the information in his new book, \u201cNever Home Alone.\u201d\n\nMORE SCIENCE CONTENT:\nWhy Lice Are So Hard To Kill\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVh7CuPUQk\nWhy Bed Bugs Are So Hard To Kill\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYACvmm5zAE\nWhy It\u2019s OK To Eat A Brown Avocado\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBHylQFplHg\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Home #Bacteria #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Dirtiest Places In Your Home"

But there\u2019s more to this diet than meets the eye.Keto basically replaces carbs with fat. A typical keto diet looks like this: 70% fat, 25% protein, 5% carbohydrates. It\u2019s a drastic change from the diet that the USDA recommends for Americans: Less than 30% fat, 20-35% protein, at least 50% carbs, and it\u2019s a significant change for your body\u2019s metabolism too. Usually, when you eat carbs, like a starchy potato, enzymes in your mouth, stomach, and small intestine break them into a form of sugar energy, called glucose, which your brain and body use for fuel.\n\nSo, when you skip out on carbs, the first couple of days you might experience some strong sugar cravings. Because your body is switching gears, from burning carbs to the only energy it has left: fat. \n\nOnce you\u2019re burning fat regularly, you\u2019ll start to see the pounds melt away. Depending on your weight, you might lose up to 3.5 pounds within the first week. As you burn more fat, levels of insulin \u2014 the fat-storing hormone \u2014 will drop significantly. This triggers your kidneys to release large amounts of sodium into the blood.\n\nWhich can actually lead to a common side effect known as the \u201cketo flu.\u201d Many keto dieters report symptoms like: Nausea, Headaches, Dizziness, Muscle cramps, and low energy levels.\n\nBut most of these symptoms will only occur within the first couple weeks of starting the diet.\n\nAfter the first month, the scales will look better. But some of that lost weight isn\u2019t actually fat. It\u2019s water.\n\nBecause some of the carbs you\u2019ve metabolized include glycogen, which retains water and therefore helps keep you hydrated. As a result, you\u2019ll likely pee more, which will lower your sodium levels even more, leading to: Dehydration, Constipation or diarrhea, and bad breath.\n\nOnce you\u2019re a couple months in you might hit the notorious keto plateau. It\u2019s a common term in the keto community and refers to when people find it harder to continue losing weight. One study, for example, found that overweight people lost an average of 15 pounds in the first month. Another 11 pounds over the next two months. But after that, they saw no change in body weight \u2014 despite sticking to the keto diet.\n\nAt this point, many people quit keto. That\u2019s why researchers often find it hard to study the long-term effects of the diet. But, as it turns out, there is one group that typically sticks to keto.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why, but keto has been proven to reduce the symptoms of epilepsy. And studies show that epileptic children who stay on very restricted keto diets for several years can suffer from: Kidney stones, High cholesterol, and bone fractures.\n\nBut a typical keto diet won\u2019t be nearly as strict and if you do want to try keto, you should talk to a doctor first.

                "description": "Medical TV shows are entertaining and dramatic, but many don\u2019t show accurate survival rates from CPR. Some TV shows are overestimating CPR survival by more than twice real-life CPR survival rates.\n\n#CPR #Survival #ScienceInsider\n\nThe following is a transcript of the video:\n\nYou're glued to the TV, watching your favorite show \u2026 there's a heart-pounding moment where a beloved character needs CPR, and then they're totally fine! But this is TV. It's not real life.\n\nIn reality, CPR is a way to keep a victim of cardiac arrest alive before additional treatment arrives. However, survival rates are much lower than what\u2019s shown on TV. For instance, one 2018 paper included 18,000 hospitalized cardiac arrest CPR cases who received CPR. Overall, only 28.5% of the adults survived to eventually leave the hospital. Now compare that to TV medical dramas. A team of researchers sat down and watched 91 episodes of Grey's Anatomy and House. And discovered that about 70% of people who received CPR survived. \u00a0That's over double the survival rate compared to reality.\n\nAnd sure, Hollywood is allowed to bend the truth for the sake of suspense. But in this case, this misinformation can be misleading. Many doctors actually opt out of CPR for themselves. There are even cases of doctors tattooing their chests to make extra sure they don't receive CPR. And it may sound paranoid but doctors know that even if you beat the odds and survive, your quality of life might never be the same.\n\nThat's because of how CPR actually works. CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. When the heart stops,\u00a0breathing air into the person's lungs and pushing down on their chest, helps keep oxygen flowing to the brain. And may restart their heart. But what they usually don't show on TV dramas, is that CPR can: \n\nFracture the breastbone\nCrack ribs \nAnd bruise the lungs\n\nThese types of injuries are common because, your heart is inside your rib cage, and surrounded by other organs. So, in order to make an impact on it, you have to compress the chest by about 5 cm. Our ribs aren't designed to withstand that kind of force. On top of that, brain cells start dying 6 minutes after the heart stops.\n\nSo people who don't receive CPR right away, are at risk of permanent brain damage. For example, one study in China found that about a third of survivors had some level of brain damage. Now, just because TV shows get most of this wrong isn't the problem. It's the fact that we believe a lot more of what we see on TV than we should. When 269 people were asked where they got information about CPR, Almost half said they used TV shows as a source.\n\nOne survey found that nearly a quarter of older people believed that 90% of CPR cases survived. Which may lead them to opt for CPR themselves. And that's especially problematic for people over 65, who have lower survival rates than younger patients. So, when it comes to medical advice ask a real doctor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat TV Shows Get Wrong About CPR",

Overall, only 28.5% of the adults survived to eventually leave the hospital. Now compare that to TV medical dramas. A team of researchers sat down and watched 91 episodes of Grey's Anatomy and House. And discovered that about 70% of people who received CPR survived. \u00a0That's over double the survival rate compared to reality.\n\nAnd sure, Hollywood is allowed to bend the truth for the sake of suspense. But in this case, this misinformation can be misleading. Many doctors actually opt out of CPR for themselves. There are even cases of doctors tattooing their chests to make extra sure they don't receive CPR. And it may sound paranoid but doctors know that even if you beat the odds and survive, your quality of life might never be the same.\n\nThat's because of how CPR actually works. CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. When the heart stops,\u00a0breathing air into the person's lungs and pushing down on their chest, helps keep oxygen flowing to the brain. And may restart their heart. But what they usually don't show on TV dramas, is that CPR can: \n\nFracture the breastbone\nCrack ribs \nAnd bruise the lungs\n\nThese types of injuries are common because, your heart is inside your rib cage, and surrounded by other organs. So, in order to make an impact on it, you have to compress the chest by about 5 cm. Our ribs aren't designed to withstand that kind of force. On top of that, brain cells start dying 6 minutes after the heart stops.\n\nSo people who don't receive CPR right away, are at risk of permanent brain damage. For example, one study in China found that about a third of survivors had some level of brain damage. Now, just because TV shows get most of this wrong isn't the problem. It's the fact that we believe a lot more of what we see on TV than we should. When 269 people were asked where they got information about CPR, Almost half said they used TV shows as a source.\n\nOne survey found that nearly a quarter of older people believed that 90% of CPR cases survived. Which may lead them to opt for CPR themselves. And that's especially problematic for people over 65, who have lower survival rates than younger patients. So, when it comes to medical advice ask a real doctor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat TV Shows Get Wrong About CPR"

                "description": "If an avocado is brown on the inside, it might not look pretty and might taste bitter. But, you can still eat guacamole that has browned only on the top layer. Avocado turns brown just like apples do when exposed to the air. It\u2019s actually a chemical reaction called oxidation and not a sign of spoiled avocado. It\u2019s safe to eat, and moderate amounts won\u2019t affect taste.\n\nIn 1989, the average American ate about one pound of avocados a year. By 2017, that amount had increased sevenfold.\n\nSome people might try to prevent browning by putting the avocado pit in the bowl, but it does not work that way. Just like with apples, bananas, and potatoes, the flesh of an avocado browns when it's exposed to oxygen in the air. It's a process called oxidation, and it happens when the oxygen reacts with compounds called polyphenols with the help of enzymes called polyphenol oxidase. This damages the tissue of the flesh, in the process turning it brown. But the brown color is not a sign that it's spoiling. You'd have to leave it out for a few days before it spoiled from oxidation. That brown color is actually from a nontoxic chemical called melanin. It shows up in everything from fruit to the iris in your eyes.\n\nNeedless to say, that bowl of brown avocado won't hurt you. However, the more oxidation that takes place, the more tissues it damages. For example, bruising or chilling an avocado for too long can lead to significant oxidation, which actually damages so much tissue that it changes the texture and flavor of the fruit so that it's mushy and bitter. But a little browning won't make a difference.\n\nHow fast your avocado browns depends on the environment, like how much oxygen is in the air, what the temperature is, and how acidic it is. Warmer temperatures accelerate the chemical reaction, turning your avocado brown faster. But if you squirt some citrus on the top, the acidity prevents oxidation, and you can keep it looking fresher for longer. Either way, even though we couldn't agree on which tasted better, both were perfectly edible. So next time you have some old avocado, don't just throw it out. And if the unsightly brown ruins you're appetite, just give it a quick stir, and voila.\n\nMORE FOOD SCIENCE CONTENT:\nI Skipped Eating Breakfast For Two Weeks And I'm Never Doing It Again\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxX-dSLtbF8\nWhat Happens When You Drink Too Much Water\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCEGMjbNug\nWhy Hardly Anyone In Israel Is Allergic To Peanuts\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X7SabQBCJw\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Avocado #Vegetable #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy It\u2019s OK To Eat A Brown Avocado",

                "description": "Lice can be hard to get rid of. In fact, head lice are now resistant to many over-the-counter treatments. Turns out, lice are a problem humans have been itching to fix for over 7 million years. Lice are small, tricky to spot, and can even hold their breath for eight hours, so they\u2019ll be fine in the shower or in a pool. They\u2019ve also developed resistance to many of our common treatments. In the last decade, experts have developed new weapons of attack, but we still haven\u2019t managed to eradicate them altogether.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nYou might not have known this, but ancient Egypt was an itchy place to live. Lice were rampant. Cleopatra, for example, was buried with solid gold lice combs, while other Egyptians would shave their entire bodies to try and get rid of the parasites. So, it\u2019s a problem we\u2019ve had for a while, and probably won\u2019t be solved anytime soon. \n\nHumans and lice have been living together for about 7 million years when our ancestors split from chimps, and we\u2019ve been itching to get rid of them ever since. There are 532 species of lice out there, but let\u2019s take a look at the most common type that plagues humans: Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis).\n\nFor starters, they have six legs, and each one has a tiny hook at the end that helps them climb from one head to another, latch onto your hair, and quickly crawl down to your scalp, where they\u2019ll feast on your blood several times a day.\u00a0And once they\u2019ve made themselves comfortable, lice are tricky to spot.\n\nAdult lice, for example, are about as large as a sesame seed, while baby lice, or nymphs, are a fraction that size.

                    "description": "Lice can be hard to get rid of. In fact, head lice are now resistant to many over-the-counter treatments. Turns out, lice are a problem humans have been itching to fix for over 7 million years. Lice are small, tricky to spot, and can even hold their breath for eight hours, so they\u2019ll be fine in the shower or in a pool. They\u2019ve also developed resistance to many of our common treatments. In the last decade, experts have developed new weapons of attack, but we still haven\u2019t managed to eradicate them altogether.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nYou might not have known this, but ancient Egypt was an itchy place to live. Lice were rampant. Cleopatra, for example, was buried with solid gold lice combs, while other Egyptians would shave their entire bodies to try and get rid of the parasites. So, it\u2019s a problem we\u2019ve had for a while, and probably won\u2019t be solved anytime soon. \n\nHumans and lice have been living together for about 7 million years when our ancestors split from chimps, and we\u2019ve been itching to get rid of them ever since. There are 532 species of lice out there, but let\u2019s take a look at the most common type that plagues humans: Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis).\n\nFor starters, they have six legs, and each one has a tiny hook at the end that helps them climb from one head to another, latch onto your hair, and quickly crawl down to your scalp, where they\u2019ll feast on your blood several times a day.\u00a0And once they\u2019ve made themselves comfortable, lice are tricky to spot.\n\nAdult lice, for example, are about as large as a sesame seed, while baby lice, or nymphs, are a fraction that size. Lice are well camouflaged too, matching the color of the hair around them.\u00a0Not to mention, your scalp is a perfect breeding ground.\u00a0In one day, a female louse can lay up to eight eggs.\u00a0Those eggs only take about a week to hatch, and once they\u2019re 10 days old, they\u2019ll start laying eggs of their own. While it\u2019s rare to find more than 20 live lice on any head, there could be dozens, or even, hundreds of dead bodies lingering on your scalp.\u00a0Feeling itchy yet?\n\nPerhaps even worse is that they\u2019re a pain to get rid of.\n\nLice can hold their breath for eight hours, so they\u2019ll be fine when you take a shower or go for a swim. They\u2019re also notorious for developing resistance to insecticides.

                "description": "Over 90% of adults pick their nose. And afterward, many people eat those boogers. But it turns out, that can be unhealthy and dangerous. Boogers trap invading viruses and bacteria before than can enter your body. So eating those boogers might expose your system to these pathogens.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nOdds are you are surrounded by nose-pickers. It\u2019s true, in one study, 91% of adults admitted to picking their nose regularly. So, chances are, you've probably mined for some juicy nose nuggets yourself. But maybe you didn\u2019t stop there. Maybe you ate those boogers too! And it turns out, that slimy snack could hurt more than just your social standing.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at that booger. It\u2019s mostly made of water, gel-like proteins that give it that gooey consistency and special immune proteins that fight off germs. Those immune proteins are especially useful. Because boogers are teeming with harmful viruses, like influenza.\n\nThat\u2019s the whole point, actually. Boogers serve as your body\u2019s front-line defense against invading germs. When you breathe in, you\u2019re not just inhaling air. You\u2019re also taking in bacteria, viruses, and dirt. Which get trapped by a layer of sticky snot that lines your nostrils. It\u2019s like fly paper for the flu. And as you continue to breathe, air hardens the mucus into a solid booger, a gooey prison cell for your ensnared enemies. Now, normally, you can get rid of that bacteria-ridden ball either when you sneeze or blow your nose.\n\nBut if you decide to eat it instead it stands to reason that you\u2019re putting yourself at risk of infection. Because as your body digests the booger, it can release those harmful pathogens into your system.\n\nNow, some people claim that eating your boogers can strengthen your immune system. By training your body to recognize and attack invading microbes. But, sorry to say, there\u2019s zero scientific evidence to support any health benefits from eating your boogers.\n\nAnd besides whether or not you eat your boogers just getting ahold of them can be dangerous. For example, scratching up the inside of your nose opens the door for a nasty bacteria that lurks under your fingernails, Staphylococcus aureus. A 2006 study found that nose-pickers were more likely to have Staph in their nose than those who abstain. And that\u2019s a big problem. Since Staph can cause serious abscesses or pus-filled pockets inside your nose and on your face. Even worse, if you keep picking you could actually puncture your septum.\n\nIn one case, a 53 year old woman managed to carve a hole right through her sinus. And if that sinus becomes infected badly enough, it can erode your skull leaving a door open for bacteria to march right into your brain.\n\nTo be fair, these are extreme scenarios. One time probably won\u2019t hurt you. The next time you feel the urge to mine for green gold, just grab a tissue.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs Eating Boogers Actually Unhealthy?",

Over time, women can change the evolutionary definition of maleness.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Evolution #Humans #ScienceInsider\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nI\u2019m Richard Prum. I\u2019m the William Robinson co-professor of ornithology at Yale University and I\u2019m the author of \u201cthe Evolution of Beauty.\u201d\n\nSo one of the things that\u2019s really mysterious about people is the evolution of our cognitive complexity, our long childhoods, language, material culture \u2013 all of these things. And they take large amounts of investment in babies to get them to grow for a really long time.\n\nThis pattern of investment was only made possible by overcoming male violence in our primate ancestors. Male chimpanzees and gorillas routinely murder babies for their own sexual advantage when they take over a troop.\n\nAnd this kind infanticide is really damaging to the sexual interest of the females.So one of the things that had to happen in human evolution was to solve the infanticide problem.\n\nHuman females have evolved or have used mate choice to transform maleness in a way that furthers their own sexual autonomy.\n\nAnd this could have included preferring males that were smaller in relative body size. That were say not as large as gorillas.\n\nThat had smaller canine teeth. They didn\u2019t have weapons in their faces like our chimpanzees ancestors.\n\nSo this is a kind of special way in which mate choice can remodel maleness in a way that furthers the sexual autonomy of the female.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Women Changed The Way Men Behave Today",

Over time, women can change the evolutionary definition of maleness.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Evolution #Humans #ScienceInsider\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nI\u2019m Richard Prum. I\u2019m the William Robinson co-professor of ornithology at Yale University and I\u2019m the author of \u201cthe Evolution of Beauty.\u201d\n\nSo one of the things that\u2019s really mysterious about people is the evolution of our cognitive complexity, our long childhoods, language, material culture \u2013 all of these things. And they take large amounts of investment in babies to get them to grow for a really long time.\n\nThis pattern of investment was only made possible by overcoming male violence in our primate ancestors. Male chimpanzees and gorillas routinely murder babies for their own sexual advantage when they take over a troop.\n\nAnd this kind infanticide is really damaging to the sexual interest of the females.So one of the things that had to happen in human evolution was to solve the infanticide problem.\n\nHuman females have evolved or have used mate choice to transform maleness in a way that furthers their own sexual autonomy.\n\nAnd this could have included preferring males that were smaller in relative body size. That were say not as large as gorillas.\n\nThat had smaller canine teeth. They didn\u2019t have weapons in their faces like our chimpanzees ancestors.\n\nSo this is a kind of special way in which mate choice can remodel maleness in a way that furthers the sexual autonomy of the female.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Women Changed The Way Men Behave Today"

Cursing while working out may even give you an extra boost of energy.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Swearing #Cursing #ScienceInsider\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nAmericans are cursing more today than ever before. In fact, the average American utters 80 to 90 curse words every day. That\u2019s about five curse words every waking hour. And it might not be in vain. Turns out, swearing may help make you live a happier, healthier life in the long-run.\n\nWhen you stub your toe and holler your favorite dirty, four-letter word, You\u2019re actually doing yourself a favor. Swearing has been known to raise your heart rate, which can help reduce the pain. For example, one study found that people who held their hand in icy water while cursing\u00a0lasted 50 percent longer than the people who used neutral words \u2014 like \u201cwooden\u201d and \u201cflat.\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still not convinced that you should curse more, consider this: Swearing could be the key to improving your workouts. Researchers asked people to curse while riding a stationary bike and holding a device that measured handgrip strength. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, participants pedaled faster and gripped stronger while spewing their favorite expletives. \u00a0And swearing won\u2019t just help you get more fit,\u00a0it can also reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nFor instance, one study found that swearing helped drivers better cope with their frustration on the road whenever a pedestrian illegally crossed the street. And in fact, this type of emotional relief is so common, it has a name: Lalochezia. Scientists think that this relief is one reason why we\u2019ve evolved to curse in the first place.Because it\u2019s a way for us to express strong emotions \u2014 like anger and frustration \u2014\u00a0without having to throw a punch or act out.\n\nAnd this method \u2014 of choosing words over violence \u2014 has other benefits, too. Studies show that people who curse are perceived as more genuine and sincere. And researchers have found that people who can list the most swear words\u00a0also come across as more honest when they\u2019re measured on a lie scale. \n\nBut there\u2019s still one place where cursing is almost always out of the question: Work. But you might have a good excuse to swear there too. Researchers studied a team of workers at a soap factory in New Zealand, and looked at the use of a particular swear word,\u00a0we'll call it \"the f-word.\"\n\nTurns out that using \"the f-word\" helped the workers express politeness, alleviate tension, and bond with each other. So, we\u2019re not saying you should curse out your boss, but a little swearing here and there can\u2019t hurt,\u00a0and sh-t, it may even help.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Cursing Does To Your Body And Brain",

                "description": "How many kids can you have? Moulay Ismail set the record with at least 1171 children. But it's different for men and women. Having children for women takes about a year, if you count the pregnancy and recovery time. For men, there is less time and resource investment, so they can have many more children. How many children men can have depends on the health of their sperm and other factors like how many women they can reproduce with.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#ScienceInsider\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nImagine having so many children, you could run a factory. That\u2019s what Moulay Ismail\u2019s family looked like. He was a brutal emperor of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty from 1672 - 1727. And is reported to have had at least 1171 children.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t the only one who used his power to have sex with any woman, whether she was interested or not. Other rulers like Augustus the Strong and Genghis Khan had hundreds of children. And while these were some of the more ruthless rulers of their time it raises a more fundamental, scientific question.\n\nWomen can reproduce for about half of their lifetime and can only give birth about once every year or so. So it makes sense that women can only have a fraction as many children as men. One study estimated a woman can have around 15 pregnancies in a lifetime. And depending on how many babies she births for each pregnancy, she\u2019d probably have around 15-30 children.\n\nBut the \u201cmost prolific mother ever,\u201d according to Guinness World Records, was Mrs. Feodor Vassilyev in 19th century Russia. She\u2019s said to have given birth to 69 children over 27 pregnancies. It\u2019s a lot for a woman. But nothing compared to Moulay Ismail, for example. According to records, he had 4 wives and 500 women in his harem.\n\nBut, there are factors not even an emperor can control. Like how a man\u2019s sperm becomes less mobile and more abnormal as he grows older. Which ultimately reduces his chances of fathering children later in life. In fact, studies suggest that men over 50 have up to a 38% lower chance of impregnating a woman compared to men under 30.\n\nFor Ismail, he fathered most of his children relatively young. So, by age 57, he had an estimated 1171 kids. But, Moulay Ismail isn\u2019t the only man in history with tons of progeny.\n\nAugustus the Strong, who was king of 18th century Poland, had a long distance relationship with his wife. But that didn\u2019t stop him from fathering a rumored 370 children by mistresses.\n\nAnd Genghis Khan, notorious for conquering large areas of 13th century Asia, is estimated to have had between 1,000-2,000 children.\nIn fact, by tracking types of Y chromosomes, Scientists estimate that up to 16 million men today who live in regions that Khan conquered could be descendants of him or his close male relatives.\n\nBut did any of these men really reach that maximum humanly possible? Turns out, the records on Ismail only spanned 32 years of his life. By one calculation, he really could have had hundreds more. If you compare that to men in more modern times, the most \u201cprolific\u201d fathers today have up to about 200 children.\n\nThat\u2019s nowhere near 1100 kids, and probably a good thing.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Many Children Can A Human Have In A Lifetime?",

                    "description": "How many kids can you have? Moulay Ismail set the record with at least 1171 children. But it's different for men and women. Having children for women takes about a year, if you count the pregnancy and recovery time. For men, there is less time and resource investment, so they can have many more children. How many children men can have depends on the health of their sperm and other factors like how many women they can reproduce with.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#ScienceInsider\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nImagine having so many children, you could run a factory. That\u2019s what Moulay Ismail\u2019s family looked like. He was a brutal emperor of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty from 1672 - 1727. And is reported to have had at least 1171 children.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t the only one who used his power to have sex with any woman, whether she was interested or not. Other rulers like Augustus the Strong and Genghis Khan had hundreds of children. And while these were some of the more ruthless rulers of their time it raises a more fundamental, scientific question.\n\nWomen can reproduce for about half of their lifetime and can only give birth about once every year or so. So it makes sense that women can only have a fraction as many children as men. One study estimated a woman can have around 15 pregnancies in a lifetime. And depending on how many babies she births for each pregnancy, she\u2019d probably have around 15-30 children.\n\nBut the \u201cmost prolific mother ever,\u201d according to Guinness World Records, was Mrs. Feodor Vassilyev in 19th century Russia. She\u2019s said to have given birth to 69 children over 27 pregnancies. It\u2019s a lot for a woman. But nothing compared to Moulay Ismail, for example. According to records, he had 4 wives and 500 women in his harem.\n\nBut, there are factors not even an emperor can control. Like how a man\u2019s sperm becomes less mobile and more abnormal as he grows older. Which ultimately reduces his chances of fathering children later in life. In fact, studies suggest that men over 50 have up to a 38% lower chance of impregnating a woman compared to men under 30.\n\nFor Ismail, he fathered most of his children relatively young. So, by age 57, he had an estimated 1171 kids. But, Moulay Ismail isn\u2019t the only man in history with tons of progeny.\n\nAugustus the Strong, who was king of 18th century Poland, had a long distance relationship with his wife. But that didn\u2019t stop him from fathering a rumored 370 children by mistresses.\n\nAnd Genghis Khan, notorious for conquering large areas of 13th century Asia, is estimated to have had between 1,000-2,000 children.\nIn fact, by tracking types of Y chromosomes, Scientists estimate that up to 16 million men today who live in regions that Khan conquered could be descendants of him or his close male relatives.\n\nBut did any of these men really reach that maximum humanly possible? Turns out, the records on Ismail only spanned 32 years of his life. By one calculation, he really could have had hundreds more. If you compare that to men in more modern times, the most \u201cprolific\u201d fathers today have up to about 200 children.\n\nThat\u2019s nowhere near 1100 kids, and probably a good thing.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Many Children Can A Human Have In A Lifetime?"

                "description": "We asked a dermatologist to explain the scientific reasons that some men aren't able to grow thick, dense facial hair. Dr. Jennifer Chwalek is a Board Certified dermatologist at Union Square Laser Dermatology in New York.\u00a0Chwalek explained that an inability to grow thick facial hair is not directly related to low levels of testosterone. Facial hair growth is largely determined by genetics, which can determine\u00a0the number of hair follicles a person has, as well as how the follicles react to a byproduct of testosterone known as dihydrotestosterone.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Beard #FacialHair #ScienceInsider\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nNarrator: Look at that beard. The density. The thickness. It's what a beard is supposed to be! Not this. This is my beard, if you even want to call it a beard. This footage was taken after I let it grow for two weeks. Two weeks! It's thin, patchy, and in some spots there's no hair at all. Sad. But let's look at this one again. This is Kevin. We're around the same age, both Caucasian males of Irish descent. You could say we have a lot in common, except in the facial hair department. So, I asked a dermatologist about why he's able to grow a beard and I'm not. \n\nDr. Jennifer Chwalek: It's based on genetics as well as hormones. Some men, you know, have more hair follicles, so they can grow denser, coarser beards than others. Testosterone gets converted in the hair follicle to a more potent form called dihydrotestosterone. Some hair follicles have receptors on them that are very sensitive to this higher form of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and that will stimulate hair growth. \n\nGraham Flanagan: How would you characterize my facial hair? \n\nDr. Chwalek: I'd say it's like, sparse, and you have light-colored hair, so it doesn't show up quite as much. \n\nFlanagan: I can't really grow a great beard. It's been a problem. I want one. I wanna look like my colleague, Kevin. I mean, look at that beard. It is just glorious. Why can't I grow a beard like Kevin? \n\nDr. Chwalek: Well, Kevin has some good hair genes, so because of that, the hair follicles on his face are more sensitive to the effects of a form of testosterone called dihydrotestosterone which can help to stimulate thicker, coarser, longer hair growth in some areas of the body like the beard area. \n\nNarrator: Beards and facial hair have long been associated with masculinity and virility. I began to wonder if my inability to grow thick facial hair like Kevin makes me less of a man. \n\nFlanagan: Does the fact that I can't grow a beard, does it make mean that I have low testosterone? \n\nDr. Chwalek: No. Men who can't grow a beard or have patchy beards usually have normal testosterone levels. It isn't a reflection of having low testosterone or being deficient in testosterone. \n\nFlanagan: So, you can still be virile \u2014 \n\nDr. Chwalek: Right. \n\nFlanagan: And grow a crappy beard like this? \n\nDr. Chwalek: Yes. \n\nFlanagan: Okay, good. \n\nNarrator:\u00a0And in fact, there are some ways to increase the chances of growing facial hair, but shaving more often isn't one of them. \n\nDr. Chwalek: So, the idea that shaving can impact hair growth is actually a myth. When you're shaving, you're just cutting the hair off at the surface of the skin, and what's controlling the hair growth is really occurring deeper in the skin. So, it shouldn't have any impact on how quickly the hair grows, or how dense the hair grows. People have tried topical Rogaine or Minoxidil. These things may stimulate a little hair growth, but assuming it's due to genetics, then you're kind of stuck with what you have. \n\nFlanagan: It's all about the sensitivity of the hair follicles and how they interact with this \u2014 \n\nDr. Chwalek: Dihydrotestosterone or androgens in the blood. \n\nFlanagan: So, you're saying that, that his hair follicles are \"sensitive.\" \n\nDr. Chwalek: Yes. \n\nFlanagan: See, mine aren't.\n\nDr. Chwalek: Right. \n\nFlanagan: They aren't sensitive. They're like rocks. They have no sensitivity at all.

These things may stimulate a little hair growth, but assuming it's due to genetics, then you're kind of stuck with what you have. \n\nFlanagan: It's all about the sensitivity of the hair follicles and how they interact with this \u2014 \n\nDr. Chwalek: Dihydrotestosterone or androgens in the blood. \n\nFlanagan: So, you're saying that, that his hair follicles are \"sensitive.\" \n\nDr. Chwalek: Yes. \n\nFlanagan: See, mine aren't.\n\nDr. Chwalek: Right. \n\nFlanagan: They aren't sensitive. They're like rocks. They have no sensitivity at all. Okay, so I win that! \n\nDr. Chwalek: Right.\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy Some Men Can't Grow Beards"

                "description": "These 4 animal dads do a lot of work for their children. Some of them don't eat while the kids develop, or defend them and make sure they survive. These dads come from the world of fish, bugs, and birds. Using different strategies and making various sacrifices, they help their offspring survive.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nImagine you\u2019re about to be a proud, new father. But first, you have to give birth. To 2,000 babies.\n\nSounds painful, right? Well, if you\u2019re a male seahorse, that\u2019s part of the job. Turns out, there are lots of animal dads out there who do all the hard work.\n\nThe hardhead catfish takes parental sacrifice to the extreme. To protect the eggs, he\u2019ll hold them in his mouth. And it\u2019s not just one or two eggs. It can be as many as 65. The eggs take up so much space that he can\u2019t eat because he might swallow one.\n\nSo, he\u2019ll fast for over two months, while the eggs develop. Believe it or not, the male giant water bug takes on an even heavier load. Females lay up to 100 eggs on the male\u2019s back. He\u2019ll carry the eggs for the next 2 to 3 weeks as they develop.\n\nBut during that time, the eggs and mucus glue his wings down, ...so that he can no longer fly, making him vulnerable to predators. Plus, the eggs weigh him down so much...he has to rely on slower, easier prey like snails. Or he just doesn\u2019t eat at all!\n\nBut it\u2019s worth it, to ensure his future offspring are safe. Lucky for the water bug, however, he can return to his regular life after the eggs hatch, and the babies fend for themselves.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case for the male rhea. He doesn\u2019t just stick around to raise his chicks on his own. He raises multiple families at once.\n\nDuring breeding season, the male rhea will build a nest to attract as many females as possible. He\u2019ll form a group with about 5 to 7 females and mate with them that season. Females lay their eggs in his nest, and then skedaddle \u2014 for good. Leaving him to raise and defend all 30 or so chicks \u2014 until they\u2019re about 6 months old. Talk about the challenges of being an only parent!\n\nLast but not least is the male emperor penguin who does a lot of the hard work early on. Females entrust their eggs to the males. But since penguins don\u2019t have nests, males must play a delicate balancing act. Keeping the egg warm atop their feet, and away from the frozen ground they stand on, They can\u2019t hunt or forage for food. They have to stay put \u2014 and protect the egg.\n\nBut the hard work doesn\u2019t end there. By the time the chicks hatch, the fathers are starved from fasting for weeks on end.\n\nBut the chicks need to be fed. So dad manages to regurgitate some food from his esophagus to feed the chick until mom returns.\n\nYum, Thanks, dad.\n\nLooks like there are a lot of animal dads who deserve an award for Father Of The Year.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Most Impressive Dads In The Animal Kingdom",

                "description": "There's a reason why people are such bad procrastinators. It's easy: Procrastinating feels great. But it's not so great for your brain since it pits two of your brain's heavy hitters, your limbic system, and your prefrontal cortex into a literal head-to-head match.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Procrastination #Psychology #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happens When You Procrastinate Too Much\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nMost of us have procrastinated at some point in our lives. But about one in every five of us are compulsive about it. Putting off tasks and chores nearly every chance they get.\n\nThey\u2019re called chronic procrastinators. And it turns out, this behavior does a lot more damage than you might think.\n\nWe get it, doing work is hard.\n\nBut when you choose to watch tv over doing laundry or washing the dishes you\u2019ve just launched an all-out battle in your brain.\n\nOn one side is your prefrontal cortex. That\u2019s the part of your brain that sets long-term goals and regulates self-control. It\u2019s telling you that those dishes aren\u2019t going to clean themselves.\n\nOn the opposing side is your limbic system. It deals with pleasure, arousal, and reward.\n\nAnd it\u2019s telling you that washing dishes is no fun, and you\u2019ll have a better time doing something else. So, procrastination essentially puts your brain in its happy place.\n\nIt feels good. That\u2019s why you do it. But just because it feels good doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s good for you.\n\nFor example, several studies have found that undergraduate college students who procrastinated had a lower GPA in the latter half of the semester compared to non-procrastinators.\n\nThey were also more likely to get sick, based on their healthcare visits.\n\nMoreover, other studies have found that procrastinators report higher levels of guilt and anxiety when they choose to procrastinate in the first place.\n\nAnd if you keep it up, researchers have found that chronic procrastination is linked to: low self-confidence, Low energy, And depression.\n\nOverall, your quality of life will probably be worse, than if you just listened to your prefrontal cortex. And you may think that you just have a different workflow or that you perform better under pressure.\n\nBut, sorry to say, there are no studies to support any benefits of chronic procrastination. Bottom line: it\u2019s unhealthy. But not all hope is lost.\n\nIn fact, researchers have conducted dozens of scientific studies in search for ways to help procrastinators. What they\u2019ve found time and again is that how you think about tasks can make a huge difference in how likely you are to procrastinate on them.\n\nTasks like saving for retirement, for example, can be abstract: There\u2019s no immediate deadline, so you can always start tomorrow. And it\u2019s this mentality that can lead you to procrastinate.\n\nInstead, make your tasks more concrete in your mind.\n\nFor example, a study in 2011 discovered that people given an illustration of how they might look at retirement age were more likely to say they would save money for retirement, than people without an illustration.\n\nThe image was something tangible. And, therefore, painted a more concrete picture of their inevitable future.\n\nWhatever the task, do your health a favor and do the work. You might just enjoy that tv show even more once you get to it.",

                    "description": "There's a reason why people are such bad procrastinators. It's easy: Procrastinating feels great. But it's not so great for your brain since it pits two of your brain's heavy hitters, your limbic system, and your prefrontal cortex into a literal head-to-head match.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Procrastination #Psychology #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happens When You Procrastinate Too Much\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nMost of us have procrastinated at some point in our lives. But about one in every five of us are compulsive about it. Putting off tasks and chores nearly every chance they get.\n\nThey\u2019re called chronic procrastinators. And it turns out, this behavior does a lot more damage than you might think.\n\nWe get it, doing work is hard.\n\nBut when you choose to watch tv over doing laundry or washing the dishes you\u2019ve just launched an all-out battle in your brain.\n\nOn one side is your prefrontal cortex. That\u2019s the part of your brain that sets long-term goals and regulates self-control. It\u2019s telling you that those dishes aren\u2019t going to clean themselves.\n\nOn the opposing side is your limbic system. It deals with pleasure, arousal, and reward.\n\nAnd it\u2019s telling you that washing dishes is no fun, and you\u2019ll have a better time doing something else. So, procrastination essentially puts your brain in its happy place.\n\nIt feels good. That\u2019s why you do it. But just because it feels good doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s good for you.\n\nFor example, several studies have found that undergraduate college students who procrastinated had a lower GPA in the latter half of the semester compared to non-procrastinators.\n\nThey were also more likely to get sick, based on their healthcare visits.\n\nMoreover, other studies have found that procrastinators report higher levels of guilt and anxiety when they choose to procrastinate in the first place.\n\nAnd if you keep it up, researchers have found that chronic procrastination is linked to: low self-confidence, Low energy, And depression.\n\nOverall, your quality of life will probably be worse, than if you just listened to your prefrontal cortex. And you may think that you just have a different workflow or that you perform better under pressure.\n\nBut, sorry to say, there are no studies to support any benefits of chronic procrastination. Bottom line: it\u2019s unhealthy. But not all hope is lost.\n\nIn fact, researchers have conducted dozens of scientific studies in search for ways to help procrastinators. What they\u2019ve found time and again is that how you think about tasks can make a huge difference in how likely you are to procrastinate on them.\n\nTasks like saving for retirement, for example, can be abstract: There\u2019s no immediate deadline, so you can always start tomorrow. And it\u2019s this mentality that can lead you to procrastinate.\n\nInstead, make your tasks more concrete in your mind.\n\nFor example, a study in 2011 discovered that people given an illustration of how they might look at retirement age were more likely to say they would save money for retirement, than people without an illustration.\n\nThe image was something tangible. And, therefore, painted a more concrete picture of their inevitable future.\n\nWhatever the task, do your health a favor and do the work. You might just enjoy that tv show even more once you get to it."

Arsenic? Cyanide? How about water?\n\nLife couldn\u2019t exist without water. But in the right circumstance... Water can be as dangerous as any poison.\nHere's what happens when you drink too much water.\nYour kidneys filter out excess waste and water from your bloodstream. But they can only process 800-1,000 mL of water an hour. And if you somehow manage to drink more than that without throwing up, you can run into trouble. Because you\u2019re drinking faster than your kidneys can process it. So the excess ends up in your cells.\n\nNormally, your cells are surrounded by a carefully-balanced solution of sodium and water, which flows in and out through tiny holes in the cellular membrane, so it keeps the sodium concentration both in and out of the cell balanced.\n\nBut when you drink too much water, the sodium solution gets diluted. It\u2019s not salty enough. So some of that extra water rushes into the cell to restore balance and that causes it to swell up.\n\nDoctors call this water intoxication and it\u2019s a big problem. Now, most of your cells can handle the swelling to a degree since soft, flexible tissue like fat and muscle can stretch.\n\nBut for the cells in your brain, it\u2019s another story, because your skull isn\u2019t stretchy.\nIt\u2019s bone. It\u2019s hard \u2014 like a rock.\n\nSo, as your brain swells, it builds up the pressure in your head.\n\nAt first, you might experience headaches, confusion, or drowsiness.\n\nBut as the pressure increases, you risk brain damage, coma, and even death. And it could all be over in less than ten hours.\n\nA 64-year-old woman, for example, died the same evening after drinking between 30-40 glasses of water. And a group of US Army trainees suffered vomiting and seizes after downing over 2 liters per hour after a tough day of training.\n\nBut it\u2019s marathon runners who need to be especially careful. A study found that 1 in 6 marathon runners develop at least mild water intoxication because the race stresses their body, including the kidneys. So, they don\u2019t excrete water as efficiently, which can cause water to back up into the blood more easily.\n\nPeople with certain kidney issues are also vulnerable since they can\u2019t properly process water and the problem isn\u2019t unique to water.\n\nFor example, the same thing can happen if you down too much beer at once. That\u2019s called potomania.\n\nThe good news is that there\u2019s an easy way to stay safe. The average healthy adult\u00a0needs somewhere around 3-4 liters of water a day. And since this can come from food and other drinks too, drink when you\u2019re thirsty, and then stop.",

Meanwhile, in Israel, hardly anyone has a peanut allergy at all.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Peanuts #Allergies #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy Hardly Anyone In Israel Is Allergic To Peanuts\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nThe U.S. has an epidemic on its hands. Peanut allergies. Between 1997 and 2008, the number of American children with a peanut allergy has tripled. And today, an estimated 1.8 million kids in the U.S. have one. That's larger than the entire population of Philadelphia. And the U.S. is not alone. The UK, Canada, and Australia have seen a similar rise in child peanut allergies. But, that's not the case for other countries like China, Thailand, Korea, the Philippines, and Israel.\n\nSo, what do these countries have that the U.S. doesn't? In Israel, there is a joke that the first three words out of every toddler's mouth are: abba, which means dad, ima, which means mom, and Bamba. Bamba is a popular peanuty snack. An estimated 90% of Israeli families buy it on a regular basis. And guess what? The peanut allergy rate in Israel is 1/10 the rate that it is in the UK. And in China and Thailand, many children eat peanut rice porridge for breakfast. And wouldn't you know it? Peanut allergies are relatively low there too.\n\nBut this could be a coincidence, right? Thank goodness we have the researchers at King's College London. They recruited 640 infants 4 to 10 months old who were at risk of developing a peanut allergy. Half of the kids in the study ate peanut snacks regularly. Whereas the other half were told to avoid peanuts entirely.\n\nThen when the kids were 5 years old, they were brought in for one final experiment. All of them were instructed to eat some type of peanut protein. Of the kids who ate peanut snacks regularly since infancy, 3.2% had developed a peanut allergy. But the kids who avoided peanuts altogether, were much worse off. More than 17% of them had developed an allergy to a nut that they had never consumed. That means they were six times more likely to develop a peanut allergy than kids who regularly ate peanuts. Of course, this is just one study. But if you know how allergies work, it begins to make sense.\n\nWhen someone with a peanut allergy encounters a peanut for the first time, their immune system kicks into overdrive. In this case, it sees the peanut as a threat. And it produces antibodies in anticipation for a future encounter. So the next time this person eats a peanut, antibodies activate an immune response which the person experiences as an allergic reaction.\n\nScientists aren't sure why some people experience reactions and others don't. But they think that early exposure can certainly help at-risk infants. And luckily, allergies aren't always set in stone. In a clinical trial earlier this year, doctors recruited children with peanut allergies. They gave them a small dose of peanut powder and slowly increased the dose over time. Sure enough, the children's immune systems became accustomed to the powder and nearly all of them were able to build up a tolerance to it.\n\nThis process, called desensitization, is a way of tricking your immune system. And it could, if used correctly and safely, become a way to treat children who have a mild reaction to peanuts. And although results have been promising so far, these treatments are not a cure. What's more, scientists suspect that genetics may also play a role in allergy development.\n\nSo, before you take matters into your own hands and start feeding your babies peanuts, talk to a doctor and make sure that you're in the clear. After all, like everything in life, peanuts should be enjoyed in moderation.",

That\u2019s over 10% of the office.\n\nAnd all of it started with just one sick person: You.\u00a0All thanks to the germ-laden cloud you so generously shared.\n\nSo, next time you\u2019re not feeling great, and sneezing up a storm,\u00a0think about your poor coworkers and take a sick day for yourself.

That\u2019s over 10% of the office.\n\nAnd all of it started with just one sick person: You.\u00a0All thanks to the germ-laden cloud you so generously shared.\n\nSo, next time you\u2019re not feeling great, and sneezing up a storm,\u00a0think about your poor coworkers and take a sick day for yourself. And them.\n\nHow Contagious Is A Single Sneeze?"

By splaying their limbs like a parachuter, cats have been known to walk away from falls as high as 32 stories up with limited injuries.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Cats  #TerminalVelocity\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow This Cat Survived A 32-Story Fall\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\n32 stories above the streets of New York City, a cat fell from a window and lived. After vets treated the cat's chipped tooth and collapsed lungs, the feline was sent home two days later.\n\nCats fall a lot, and they've gotten really good at it. Drop a cat upside down, for example, and it will almost always land on its feet. That's because cats are extremely flexible. They can twist their bodies mid-air as they fall.\n\nBut landing feet first isn't always the best strategy. Like if you're falling from 32 stories up. To figure out how cats manage that perfect landing every time, a series of studies looked at over a 100 cats' falls from two to 32 stories up.\n\nComes as no surprise that cats who fell from the second floor had fewer injuries than cats who fell from the sixth floor. But here is the fascinating part. Above the seventh story, the extent of the injuries largely stayed the same, no matter how high the cats fell. So, how is that possible?\n\nWell, it all comes down to acrobatics or lack thereof. Cats that fell from two to seven stories up mostly landed feet first. Above that, however, cats used a different technique. Instead of positioning their legs straight down as they fell, they splayed out like a parachuter. And landed belly-first instead.\n\nBut this method isn't 100% foolproof. Chest trauma, like a collapsed lung, or broken rib is more common with this landing method. But the risk of breaking a leg is much less. So, how do cats somehow subconsciously know how to land?\n\nIt has to do with a physics phenomenon called terminal velocity. At first, the cat plummets faster and faster under gravity until she's fallen the equivalent of five stories. At that point, she hits constant terminal velocity at 100 kilometers per hour. She's now in free fall where air friction counteracts her acceleration under gravity. At this point, she's no longer accelerating and, more importantly, doesn't feel the pull from gravity.\n\nSo, here's what researchers think is happening. From two to seven stories up, cats don't have enough time to reach terminal velocity and prep for landing feet first. But once they hit terminal velocity, their instinct changes and they parachute their limbs.\n\nAll that said, don't throw your cat out of a window. I can't believe I have to say this. Not only is it still very dangerous, it's not very polite. Don't throw your cat out the window just to see all that go down. Just watch this video again. Just hit the little replay button.",

We spoke with dermatologist Dr. Seemal Desai for more information.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Sunscreen #SkinCancer\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy American Sunscreens Suck\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nNarrator: In 2017, researchers tested 20 best-selling US sunscreens. The good news is that 19 of them met FDA standards. The bad news? Nine of them didn't meet European standards. Turns out, different countries have different rules for what makes a safe sunscreen and US sunscreens may not be protecting Americans as well as it could. When we lay in the sun, our skin absorbs two types of UV light. UVA and UVB rays. UVB light is higher energy and can cause sunburns while UVA penetrates deeper under the skin and can damage skin cells along the bottom layer of your epidermis.\n\nDesai: We know that UVB rays are the rays that cause sunburns. But UVA rays are the rays that can actually cause skin cancer so you actually wanna cover the spectrum on both of those. I think a lot of people get into a misconception that I didn't get sunburned so I'm not at prone to getting skin cancer which really isn't true.\n\nNarrator: The biggest concern with US sunscreen is how much protection you're getting from cancer-causing UVA rays. For decades, FDA regulations required that sunscreens protect against UVB, but not necessarily against UVA. Meanwhile, rates for melanoma, a dangerous form of skin cancer, kept climbing in the US. Then, in 2012, the FDA updated its regulations on labeling and testing so that manufacturers must now let customers know if its sunscreen protects against both UVB and UVA. That's what the broad spectrum label on your sunscreen means, for example. And while this is a good first step, there's still no regulation on how much protection you're getting from UVA. So, there's no way to tell.\n\nDesai: Here in the United States, I think we need to be cognizant of the fact that when a sunscreen says it's broad spectrum, UVA- and UVB-protecting, that does mean you're going to get protection against those rays. However, what it does not mean is that it's going to block out all of the rays.\n\nNarrator: And that's where US sunscreens fall short.\n\nDesai: And I will say that I do think we are behind other countries globally, particularly some of our European counterparts, in getting new sunscreen ingredients approved. Overall, there has not been much change in US sunscreen composition and what our sunscreens are made up of in the past several years.\n\nNarrator: The FDA has approved 16 active ingredients that protect against UV radiation. But only some protect against both UVB and UVA rays. For comparison, Europe requires that all of its more than 20 active ingredients protect against both.\n\nDesai: Right now, the American Academy of Dermatology and other organizations are really advocating with the FDA that they need to really speed up the approval process for new sunscreen ingredients. Because it's with these ingredients that we can probably get even better coverage and better protection and maybe even get something that's easier to apply, that's easier on the skin, that doesn't have any harmful side effects for patients.\n\nNarrator: You can purchase sunscreens from other countries online. But if you plan on sticking with American sunscreens, look for the broad spectrum label and don't buy anything below SPF 30.\n\nDesai: The higher the SPF, definitely the better. But we definitely don't want anyone going below a 30. And think about if you're someone who has a history of a melanoma, if you use an SPF 30, you're blocking out let's say 98% of the harmful rays. However, what about the remaining 2%? That 2% may be something that could be potential of putting you at a risk down the road.",

I think a lot of people get into a misconception that I didn't get sunburned so I'm not at prone to getting skin cancer which really isn't true.\n\nNarrator: The biggest concern with US sunscreen is how much protection you're getting from cancer-causing UVA rays. For decades, FDA regulations required that sunscreens protect against UVB, but not necessarily against UVA. Meanwhile, rates for melanoma, a dangerous form of skin cancer, kept climbing in the US. Then, in 2012, the FDA updated its regulations on labeling and testing so that manufacturers must now let customers know if its sunscreen protects against both UVB and UVA. That's what the broad spectrum label on your sunscreen means, for example. And while this is a good first step, there's still no regulation on how much protection you're getting from UVA. So, there's no way to tell.\n\nDesai: Here in the United States, I think we need to be cognizant of the fact that when a sunscreen says it's broad spectrum, UVA- and UVB-protecting, that does mean you're going to get protection against those rays. However, what it does not mean is that it's going to block out all of the rays.\n\nNarrator: And that's where US sunscreens fall short.\n\nDesai: And I will say that I do think we are behind other countries globally, particularly some of our European counterparts, in getting new sunscreen ingredients approved. Overall, there has not been much change in US sunscreen composition and what our sunscreens are made up of in the past several years.\n\nNarrator: The FDA has approved 16 active ingredients that protect against UV radiation. But only some protect against both UVB and UVA rays. For comparison, Europe requires that all of its more than 20 active ingredients protect against both.\n\nDesai: Right now, the American Academy of Dermatology and other organizations are really advocating with the FDA that they need to really speed up the approval process for new sunscreen ingredients. Because it's with these ingredients that we can probably get even better coverage and better protection and maybe even get something that's easier to apply, that's easier on the skin, that doesn't have any harmful side effects for patients.\n\nNarrator: You can purchase sunscreens from other countries online. But if you plan on sticking with American sunscreens, look for the broad spectrum label and don't buy anything below SPF 30.\n\nDesai: The higher the SPF, definitely the better. But we definitely don't want anyone going below a 30. And think about if you're someone who has a history of a melanoma, if you use an SPF 30, you're blocking out let's say 98% of the harmful rays. However, what about the remaining 2%? That 2% may be something that could be potential of putting you at a risk down the road."

That's why a team out of Europe has developed a way to take out the space trash, and they just tested it in spectacular fashion.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#SpaceTravel #Europe\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Europe Will Save Space Travel\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nNarrator: Europe is leading one of the most important space travel efforts of this century. It's a mission called RemoveDEBRIS, and if all goes according to plan, it could save the future of space travel as we know it.\n\nThe objective of RemoveDEBRIS is just that. Demonstrate how we could remove space debris that's cluttering up Earth's orbit, including pieces of used up rockets and retired satellites. Even though you can't see it from the ground, there are more than half a million chunks of space trash flying around our planet, and most of it is concentrated in low earth orbit, where it whips around at 28,000 kilometers an hour. Fast enough to fly from LA to London, in just 19 minutes, but here's the trouble with that. Low earth orbit is our front door to the universe. To get anywhere in space, whether it's the International Space Station, Mars, or beyond, we have to cross that threshold first, but if you have a bunch of garbage blocking your path, it's gonna be difficult. Even worse, experts, like astrophysicist Donald Kessler, fear that just one collision between two large objects, could seal up that opening forever, because it would set off a chain reaction. One collision after another, after another, which could produce thousands of additional pieces of debris. This domino effect is called the \"Kessler Syndrome,\" after Donald Kessler himself, and it predicts that low earth orbit could become littered with space trash, making it too dangerous for spacecraft to fly through, or also reduce their life spans because of collisions.\n\nThat's where Europe's RemoveDEBRIS mission comes in. In 2018, it successfully tested the first of four stages of its trash clean up technology, and it looked like this. This is not an illustration. This is actually happening in space. That's a net about the size of a large dining room tablecloth, ensnaring a small spacecraft that the mission team planted for the experiment. Now, this was just the first of what will, hopefully, be many more tests, because in the future, we're gonna need a bigger net.\n\nGuglielmo S. Aglietti: At the end of the day, the final goal is to be able to capture very large targets, so, possibly what one of the targets that has been mentioned, as a potential one, is an old satellite, Envisat, and it is maybe the size of a bus.\n\nNarrator:\u00a0Scientists have been proposing ways to clean up space junk since the early 90s. They've thought of everything, from lasers, to robotic claws. But this is the first time any concept has actually been tested in space. The team hopes to test its other three technologies, as well, which involve a harpoon, for spearing the trash, a navigation system for analyzing the trash's size, distance, and rotation, and a sail for slowing the trash down, so it can reenter, and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. But all this technology isn't the reason this mission has come closer than any before it.\n\nAglietti: Everybody agrees, that to remove some of this debris, is the right thing to do, but, clearly, the issue is going to be, you know, the cost.\n\nNarrator: The RemoveDEBRIS project has cost 15 million euro, or, about 17 million US dollars.\n\nAglietti: The current mission was sponsored by the European community, and, again, we had, you know, ten partners, working on this project, and, overall, the cost of this project was about, you know, \u20ac15 [million]. When you are going to do this kind of mission, for real, the cost will be higher, and, so, I think the various stakeholders around the world, have to get together, and decide how such mission could be funded. We are talking about not just, you know, the UK, or, maybe, NASA, but also, China, you know, Russia, and so on. The problem is, again, who is going to pay for it?\n\nNarrator: So, Europe has taken the lead. Rest of the world, it's your turn now.",

In the middle of the ocean lies the\u00a0Giant Pacific Garbage Patch that shows us just how much this problem has gotten out of hand. Here are some comparisons\u00a0on how massive the Giant Pacific Garbage Patch is. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nThe world produces enough plastic each year to build 50 Pyramids of Giza. That\u2019s over 350 million tons of candy wrappers, PVC pipes, and synthetic t-shirts. While most of it ends up in landfills 8 million tons wind up in our oceans each year.\n\nWhere most finds its way into massive garbage patches around the world. And the biggest of them all is called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. How Big The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Really Is. If you picked up each piece of plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch you\u2019d carry away about 1.8 trillion\u00a0individual pieces. That\u2019s ten times more than there are stars in our Milky Way Galaxy. And it would weigh a whopping 80,000 tons. Equivalent to the weight of three Statues of Liberty.\n\nHalf of the entire patch is made of plastic fishing nets, lines, and ropes, which come from intense fishing activity near the area. The other half is mostly hard plastics and films, like water bottles and plastic wrap. But don\u2019t let the name \u201cGreat Pacific Garbage Patch\u201d fool you. It doesn\u2019t look like a giant mountain of trash at all. It\u2019s actually scattered over a region of ocean that\u2019s twice the size of Texas, according to some estimates.\n\nSo if you wanted to pick up every piece of plastic, it would take you 121 days at a walking pace of 5 km/hr to cover the entire area. Though in reality, there\u2019s no true end since the garbage patch is constantly ebbing and flowing with the ocean currents. But let\u2019s pretend you could scoop it all up into one place. There\u2019d be enough plastic to fill 100 Boeing 747 planes!\n\nAnd the patch is only getting bigger. It\u2019s been growing exponentially larger for nearly 70 years. Partly because once the plastic is there it\u2019ll stick around for centuries. Those plastic fishing lines, for example, will take 600 years to break down.\n\nAnd even after they break down, the damage doesn\u2019t stop there. Most end up as microplastics that are too small to see with the naked eye. But can make it into the bellies of sea animals and ultimately the humans that eat those animals. Worldwide, researchers have found ingested microplastics in, every species of sea turtle. Nearly 60% of whale species. And almost 60% of seabirds.\n\nPlus, more plastic is pouring into the world\u2019s oceans each day. In fact, experts estimate that by the year 2050 the amount of plastic in the oceans will outweigh all the world\u2019s fish.\n\nThink about that the next time you toss your water bottle in the trash because the recycling\u2019s full.",

Just move to Europe. It rarely sees full-on hurricanes. But that may soon change. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nEurope hasn't had a hurricane reach its shore in over 50 years. Now don't get the wrong idea. Hurricane season still brings a hefty dose of wind and rain. But Europe has something that North America doesn't, when it comes to protection against hurricanes. Location.\n\nHurricanes usually form off the coast of West Africa, where warm water near the Equator and high humidity create columns of rapidly rising rotating air. It's the perfect recipe for a storm. Now the more warm, moist air that the system picks up, the stronger it becomes. That's why a tropical storms can quickly grow into a full on hurricane as it marches across the Atlantic. Now normally hurricanes are propelled on a westward track by the trade winds, caused by the Earth's rotation. That's why Europe as well as the West Coast of the US, rarely experience full on hurricanes. But that's not the whole story.\n\nAfter all, since the year 2000, remnants of around 30 hurricanes have reached Europe. For comparison, Florida has seen 79 real hurricanes over the same time frame. By the time these remnants make landfall, they've went from a hurricane force, to a tropical storm or weaker. And that's where Europe's location comes into play. In order for a hurricane to head towards Europe, something crucial has to happen. It has to travel really far North by about 200 miles. Once a storm system reaches 30 degrees north, it encounters the subtropical jet stream. Which moves in the opposite direction of the trade winds. And therefore, blows the storm East But because the storm is now farther North, the waters underneath are colder by up to about five to 10 degrees Celsius. Which means less energy available to feed the storm. And as a result, it starts to die down by the time it's headed for Europe. Even though it's no longer a hurricane, it still packs a punch when it hits shore. In fact, most of these hurricane remnants will combine with other nearby cyclones and weather fronts, that create high winds and rain that mainly hit Ireland and Great Britain. But have been known to reach as far as Greece or even farther in Northern Russia. Typical damages include power outages, flooding, and occasionally casualties. Most recently the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia made landfall in Ireland and Scotland in 2017. About 50,000 households in Northern Ireland lost power. Three deaths were reported and downed trees closed many of the public roads and highways. This was the worst storm that Ireland had seen in 50 years. And it may be a sign of what's to come.\n\nAs global surface temperatures rise, it will also increase the sea surface temperatures in the Northern Atlantic. Which researchers estimate could contribute to an increase in the number of hurricane force storms that reach Europe. Some experts predict that by the end of the 21st century, Europe could experience, on average, 13 powerful storms each year during hurricane season. Compared to the two per year it sees now.",

                "description": "During the Cold War, the US government launched a 1.4 megaton bomb into space. Starfish Prime, as the test was called, was the highest-altitude nuclear test in history. But what would happen if we tried the same experiment with a 50 megaton bomb, like the record-setting Tsar Bomba?\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#Space #NuclearBomb\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nImagine if we detonated a nuclear bomb in space? Actually, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nYou can see it for yourself. That was Starfish Prime \u2014 the highest-altitude nuclear test in history. In 1962, the US government launched a 1.4 megaton bomb from Johnston Island. And detonated it 400 km above the Pacific \u2014 about as high as where the International Space Station orbits today.\n\nThe detonation generated a giant fireball and created a burst of energy called\u00a0an electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, that expanded for over 1,000 kilometers.\n\nEMPs can cause a power surge, damaging electronic equipment in the process. And this one was no different. Across Hawaii, street lights went dark, telephones went down, and navigation and radar systems went out, not to mention the six, or so, satellites that failed.\n\nAnd all this came from a 1.4 megaton bomb. Tsar Bomba, which was the largest nuclear bomb that has ever been detonated, was 50 megatons.\n\nSo what would happen if we detonated that above the United States?\n\nFor starters, there's no atmosphere in space. So, there would be no mushroom-shaped cloud and no subsequent blast wave or mass destruction. Instead, you\u2019d get a blinding fireball 4 times the size of Starfish Prime\u2019s. And if you looked directly at it within the first 10 seconds, you could permanently damage your eyes.\n\nSatellites wouldn\u2019t be safe either. Radiation from the explosion would fry the circuits of hundreds of instruments in low-earth orbit. Including communication satellites, military spy satellites, and even science telescopes like the Hubble.\n\nPlus, astronauts on board the International Space Station might be at risk of radiation poisoning.\n\nOn the ground, however, you\u2019d probably be fine. The detonation point would be far enough away that the high-energy radiation wouldn\u2019t reach you.\n\nBut don\u2019t get too comfortable. Remember Starfish Prime\u2019s EMP? This time, the EMP would cover \u2153 of the entire United States, bringing down regional power grids and electronics like a lightning strike.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. The radiation would also interact with oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere and create a spectacular aurora near the detonation site, that would last for days.\n\nNow, let\u2019s be clear. This will probably never happen. Super-thermonuclear devices like the Tsar Bomba no longer exist. And even if they did, the Tsar Bomba weighed around 27,000 kilograms. There are only a couple of operational rockets in the world that could manage to lift something that heavy into space in the first place.\n\nSo we're probably safe from that, anyway.

                    "description": "During the Cold War, the US government launched a 1.4 megaton bomb into space. Starfish Prime, as the test was called, was the highest-altitude nuclear test in history. But what would happen if we tried the same experiment with a 50 megaton bomb, like the record-setting Tsar Bomba?\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#Space #NuclearBomb\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nImagine if we detonated a nuclear bomb in space? Actually, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nYou can see it for yourself. That was Starfish Prime \u2014 the highest-altitude nuclear test in history. In 1962, the US government launched a 1.4 megaton bomb from Johnston Island. And detonated it 400 km above the Pacific \u2014 about as high as where the International Space Station orbits today.\n\nThe detonation generated a giant fireball and created a burst of energy called\u00a0an electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, that expanded for over 1,000 kilometers.\n\nEMPs can cause a power surge, damaging electronic equipment in the process. And this one was no different. Across Hawaii, street lights went dark, telephones went down, and navigation and radar systems went out, not to mention the six, or so, satellites that failed.\n\nAnd all this came from a 1.4 megaton bomb. Tsar Bomba, which was the largest nuclear bomb that has ever been detonated, was 50 megatons.\n\nSo what would happen if we detonated that above the United States?\n\nFor starters, there's no atmosphere in space. So, there would be no mushroom-shaped cloud and no subsequent blast wave or mass destruction. Instead, you\u2019d get a blinding fireball 4 times the size of Starfish Prime\u2019s. And if you looked directly at it within the first 10 seconds, you could permanently damage your eyes.\n\nSatellites wouldn\u2019t be safe either. Radiation from the explosion would fry the circuits of hundreds of instruments in low-earth orbit. Including communication satellites, military spy satellites, and even science telescopes like the Hubble.\n\nPlus, astronauts on board the International Space Station might be at risk of radiation poisoning.\n\nOn the ground, however, you\u2019d probably be fine. The detonation point would be far enough away that the high-energy radiation wouldn\u2019t reach you.\n\nBut don\u2019t get too comfortable. Remember Starfish Prime\u2019s EMP? This time, the EMP would cover \u2153 of the entire United States, bringing down regional power grids and electronics like a lightning strike.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. The radiation would also interact with oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere and create a spectacular aurora near the detonation site, that would last for days.\n\nNow, let\u2019s be clear. This will probably never happen. Super-thermonuclear devices like the Tsar Bomba no longer exist. And even if they did, the Tsar Bomba weighed around 27,000 kilograms. There are only a couple of operational rockets in the world that could manage to lift something that heavy into space in the first place.\n\nSo we're probably safe from that, anyway.

Most people think keeping them alive longer makes them safer to eat, but that's not the full story. Oyster expert Julie Qiu explains.\n\nFollowing is the transcript of the video.\n\nDavid Anderson: \"Wanna know a secret? This oyster I'm about to eat could still be alive!\u00a0So, why do we do this?\"\n\nMost people think it's a food safety issue. Keep the oyster alive as long as possible, to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.\u00a0\u00a0And there is a little bit of truth to that. Oysters can carry a scary flesh-eating bacteria called vibrio vulnificus. You can get it from oysters or from swimming in warm brackish water. But let's put that into perspective.\u00a0\n\nJulie Qiu: \"The risk of running into a bad oyster is lower than people think it is. My biggest pet peeve is that people go crazy over one bad oyster but they don't really care that hundreds of thousands of pounds of lettuce are contaminated with salmonella\"\n\nAbout 100 people die from vibrio infections (including from vibrio vulnificus) each year, about 450 die from salmonella.\u00a0Plus, the FDA requires that oyster farms have to test water quality before sending oysters out to markets and restaurants. And that's important, because oysters are filter feeders. They soak up basically anything that's in the water around them \u2014 including fecal matter which can come from rain runoff.\n\nBut there\u2019s a clever way to check if your oysters are good.\n\nJulie Qiu: \"one thing that you can ask for is a shellfish tag, which every retailer or restaurant is required to have for every bag of oysters that they purchase for up to 90 days after they make that purchase. So that tag, if they don't have it, don't eat those oysters.\"\n\nThis tag is a way for restaurants to track where and when their oysters were farmed.\u00a0Qiu says that she looks for the most recent dates on the tag. Anything further out than two weeks won't taste as good and increases the risk of a bad oyster.\n\nSome chefs may look at you funny for asking for the documentation, but it's a strategy that apparently works.\n\nJulie Qiu:\u00a0\"I've had thousands of oysters and never had a bad one\"\n\nOk great, so basically, oysters are safe, why on earth are they sometimes alive when we eat them??\n\nJulie Qiu:\u00a0\"You really want your raw shellfish to be really fresh and the freshest you can get is something that is recently killed, so it goes back to not only the food safety but the actual taste and texture is going to be far superior when it's a fresh oyster.\"\u00a0\n\nSo yeah, freshly killed oysters taste better. And it's hard to tell exactly when an oyster dies, because before it's served, it's shucked. It's not a gentle process.\u00a0Shucking involves separating the oyster\u2019s abductor muscle from the shell. This muscle gives the oyster control over opening and closing its shell. Similar to how your spinal cord helps you move.\u00a0So, severing the their abductor muscle is almost like severing your spine. Yikes.\n\nMost restaurants in the US keep their oysters alive - on ice - up until this shucking process, which afterwards, either leaves the oyster dead, or immobile. Since they don\u2019t move around much in the first place, it's not easy to tell which.\n\nSo you're eating an oyster that was either just killed or is dying. And that seems pretty cruel, right? But considering that the oyster's biology is very primitive, it's possible they might not even feel pain at all.\n\nJulie Qiu:\u00a0\"They don't have a brain, they're not really processing pain the same way the same way we are feeling so I don't think they're feeling pain the same way we are thinking of it.\"\n\nSo really, it's up to you. If you don't want to eat oysters, that's fine. If you do, you'll be far from the first.\n\nJulie Qiu:\u00a0\"It's one of the few foods that have not changed for thousands and thousands of years so being able to appreciate that is something that's really special and remarkable and something that should be celebrated for what it is.\"",

It turns out, just a few ounces of water can be too much for an infant to handle, resulting in water intoxication that can even be fatal.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#WhyBabiesCantDrinkWater \n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nWhile adults need a constant reminder to drink more and stay hydrated, it's a different story for newborn babies. Their bodies aren't developed enough to consume even a few ounces\u00a0of water, which in extreme cases could be fatal. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nThere is a time in every person\u2019s life when drinking water is deadly. Even as much as a few ounces is enough to kill.\n\nThe average, healthy adult is made up of 55-60% water. The average baby, on the other hand, is roughly 75% water. And that difference is why babies shouldn\u2019t drink water before they\u2019re at least 6 months old. Not from the tap, or a well, or a spring. Plain water is just plain off limits.\n\nYou see, everyone\u2019s kidneys have a limit to how much water they can handle. Break that limit, and the excess water will back up into your bloodstream, where it dilutes the salt, or sodium, in your blood.\n\nOnce your blood dips below 0.4 ounces of sodium per gallon, you\u2019re at risk of a condition called Hyponatremia. It happens when your cells try to return sodium levels to normal by absorbing the extra water and swell up like a water balloon in the process, causing complications like confusion, vomiting, and muscle spasms.\n\nHyponatremia is common in marathon runners who drink too much, too fast during a race without also providing enough sodium to balance out their blood. And if you keep drinking, that excess water will eventually reach the cells in your brain. By this point, you have a dangerous case of water intoxication, which affects roughly 200,000 Americans each year.\n\nIt occurs when your brain cells swell, which builds up pressure inside your skull. That can lead to seizures, brain damage, and \u2014 in severe cases \u2014 death.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, dying from water intoxication is extremely hard for a fully-grown human. An adult would have to drink 2.5-5 gallons every few hours to reach that point.\n\nBut for newborns, it\u2019s a different story. Their kidneys are about half the size of an adult\u2019s. So, they can\u2019t hold much water to begin with, and it takes just a few ounces to cause problems.\n\nOn top of that, their kidneys aren\u2019t developed enough, yet, to properly filter water.

                    "description": "While drinking ample amount of water is generally good health practice for adults, it can be deadly for newborn babies. It turns out, just a few ounces of water can be too much for an infant to handle, resulting in water intoxication that can even be fatal.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#WhyBabiesCantDrinkWater \n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nWhile adults need a constant reminder to drink more and stay hydrated, it's a different story for newborn babies. Their bodies aren't developed enough to consume even a few ounces\u00a0of water, which in extreme cases could be fatal. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nThere is a time in every person\u2019s life when drinking water is deadly. Even as much as a few ounces is enough to kill.\n\nThe average, healthy adult is made up of 55-60% water. The average baby, on the other hand, is roughly 75% water. And that difference is why babies shouldn\u2019t drink water before they\u2019re at least 6 months old. Not from the tap, or a well, or a spring. Plain water is just plain off limits.\n\nYou see, everyone\u2019s kidneys have a limit to how much water they can handle. Break that limit, and the excess water will back up into your bloodstream, where it dilutes the salt, or sodium, in your blood.\n\nOnce your blood dips below 0.4 ounces of sodium per gallon, you\u2019re at risk of a condition called Hyponatremia. It happens when your cells try to return sodium levels to normal by absorbing the extra water and swell up like a water balloon in the process, causing complications like confusion, vomiting, and muscle spasms.\n\nHyponatremia is common in marathon runners who drink too much, too fast during a race without also providing enough sodium to balance out their blood. And if you keep drinking, that excess water will eventually reach the cells in your brain. By this point, you have a dangerous case of water intoxication, which affects roughly 200,000 Americans each year.\n\nIt occurs when your brain cells swell, which builds up pressure inside your skull. That can lead to seizures, brain damage, and \u2014 in severe cases \u2014 death.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, dying from water intoxication is extremely hard for a fully-grown human. An adult would have to drink 2.5-5 gallons every few hours to reach that point.\n\nBut for newborns, it\u2019s a different story. Their kidneys are about half the size of an adult\u2019s. So, they can\u2019t hold much water to begin with, and it takes just a few ounces to cause problems.\n\nOn top of that, their kidneys aren\u2019t developed enough, yet, to properly filter water. So, any water that enters their body ends up in the circulatory system,\u00a0where it dilutes their blood, and increases their water content by 7 to 8%.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just drinking straight H2O that poses a threat. In fact, most cases of water intoxication in infants don\u2019t even involve a glass of water. A common mistake is when people dilute baby formula TOO MUCH, by accident, or when parents dunk their infants up and down in a swimming pool, and in the process, the infant gulps in too much water.\n\nIt\u2019s important that if your baby is showing signs of water intoxication that you take them to the hospital immediately, where a doctor will likely provide some form of fluids, like intravenous saline solution, to bring the infant's sodium levels up to normal."

                "description": "Activated charcoal is having a moment in food, beauty, and supplement industries right now. But how does it work? And is it even good for you?\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nInstagram is blowing up with black-looking food and beauty products.\u00a0Thanks to this stuff.\u00a0It\u2019s called activated charcoal, or activated carbon.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not what you use to BBQ ribs. It\u2019s what health-trend fanatics are using to detox, brighten skin, and whiten their teeth.\u00a0But just because you can wash with it, eat it, and brush your teeth with it, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should.\n\nThe global market for activated charcoal is projected to reach $6.2 billion by 2022.\u00a0An impressive feat, considering it comes from the same stuff as your grilling charcoal: burnt wood.\n\nThe difference is that activated charcoal is burned at higher temperatures, so it breaks down into a fine powder.\u00a0Which gives it a larger surface area than a chunk of charcoal on the grill.\u00a0And that\u2019s exactly what you want when you\u2019re trying to remove toxins from your body.\n\nHow it works has to do with the microscopic structure of the charcoal itself.\u00a0\u00a0Inside each particle are millions of pores that act like a tiny trap.\u00a0Swallow some, for example, and the outsides will bind to other substances in your gut.\u00a0Which is helpful if you\u2019ve just overdosed on drugs since it can prevent them from entering your system.\u00a0And in fact, this is exactly what hospitals will use to treat certain cases of poisoning before resorting to pumping the stomach.\n\nBut drugs aren\u2019t the only thing charcoal binds to.\u00a0It can also soak up minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants.\u00a0So when you drink charcoal-laced lemonade with a healthy meal, you\u2019re absorbing fewer nutrients than you otherwise would.\u00a0To make matters worse, it can prevent medications, like antidepressants and contraceptive pills, from reaching your system.\n\nThe key to activated charcoal \u2014 whether it\u2019s saving a life or depriving you of nutrition \u2014 is timing.\u00a0\u00a0It only works if there\u2019s something for it to absorb in the first place.\u00a0So, taking charcoal pills for a hangover the next morning isn\u2019t going to help.\u00a0Because that alcohol is long gone from your stomach by then.\u00a0But ingesting charcoal for any other reason than treating a severe case of poisoning isn\u2019t a good idea.\u00a0It\u2019s indigestible.\u00a0So after you eat it, your body passes it along and eventually out the other end.\u00a0But along the way, it can have side effects like constipation and nausea.\n\nNot to mention, there\u2019s no evidence to support the claims from charcoal enthusiasts that it\u2019ll\u00a0prevent bloating, boost energy, brighten skin, or whiten teeth.\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t like the idea of eating black \u2026 anything \u2026 then don\u2019t!\u00a0Your body is probably better off, anyway.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Charcoal #ActivatedCharcoal #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Activated Charcoal Actually Does To Your Body | The Human Body",

It\u2019s what health-trend fanatics are using to detox, brighten skin, and whiten their teeth.\u00a0But just because you can wash with it, eat it, and brush your teeth with it, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should.\n\nThe global market for activated charcoal is projected to reach $6.2 billion by 2022.\u00a0An impressive feat, considering it comes from the same stuff as your grilling charcoal: burnt wood.\n\nThe difference is that activated charcoal is burned at higher temperatures, so it breaks down into a fine powder.\u00a0Which gives it a larger surface area than a chunk of charcoal on the grill.\u00a0And that\u2019s exactly what you want when you\u2019re trying to remove toxins from your body.\n\nHow it works has to do with the microscopic structure of the charcoal itself.\u00a0\u00a0Inside each particle are millions of pores that act like a tiny trap.\u00a0Swallow some, for example, and the outsides will bind to other substances in your gut.\u00a0Which is helpful if you\u2019ve just overdosed on drugs since it can prevent them from entering your system.\u00a0And in fact, this is exactly what hospitals will use to treat certain cases of poisoning before resorting to pumping the stomach.\n\nBut drugs aren\u2019t the only thing charcoal binds to.\u00a0It can also soak up minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants.\u00a0So when you drink charcoal-laced lemonade with a healthy meal, you\u2019re absorbing fewer nutrients than you otherwise would.\u00a0To make matters worse, it can prevent medications, like antidepressants and contraceptive pills, from reaching your system.\n\nThe key to activated charcoal \u2014 whether it\u2019s saving a life or depriving you of nutrition \u2014 is timing.\u00a0\u00a0It only works if there\u2019s something for it to absorb in the first place.\u00a0So, taking charcoal pills for a hangover the next morning isn\u2019t going to help.\u00a0Because that alcohol is long gone from your stomach by then.\u00a0But ingesting charcoal for any other reason than treating a severe case of poisoning isn\u2019t a good idea.\u00a0It\u2019s indigestible.\u00a0So after you eat it, your body passes it along and eventually out the other end.\u00a0But along the way, it can have side effects like constipation and nausea.\n\nNot to mention, there\u2019s no evidence to support the claims from charcoal enthusiasts that it\u2019ll\u00a0prevent bloating, boost energy, brighten skin, or whiten teeth.\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t like the idea of eating black \u2026 anything \u2026 then don\u2019t!\u00a0Your body is probably better off, anyway.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Charcoal #ActivatedCharcoal #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Activated Charcoal Actually Does To Your Body | The Human Body"

It\u2019s only when you stop brushing it away that things can get ugly. And not only for your teeth. It just so happens that \u201cStrep\u201d and his friends are a downright threat to your life.\n\nNearly half of Americans don\u2019t brush their teeth enough.

Soon enough, that infection will trigger your immune system. Which sends fighter cells to battle the bacteria. This creates a hostile environment for the bacteria, which is what you want. But it can also damage the cells in nearby tissue and bone.\n\n6 months to years later, that tissue and bone will eventually die. At this point, you don\u2019t have gingivitis anymore. You have something much worse: periodontal disease. No more tissue and bone means no structural support. So, your gums separate from your teeth forming pockets that quickly become extra space for \u201cStrep\u201d and his friends. Which further infects your gums, causing your teeth to fall out.\n\nNow, you may think this could never happen to you but about 10% of Americans between ages 50-64 have lost not just one or two, but ALL of their teeth! And to make matters worse, \u201cStrep\u201d and his buddies may enter your bloodstream, where they\u2019ll wreak havoc on your organs, too.\n\nFor example, in one study, people with periodontal disease were 4.5 times more likely to have chronic kidney disease than people with healthy gums.

However, not all dogs will automatically show you their love and affection. \n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nYour dog is the best. You go on long walks together, cuddle up on the couch, and enjoy sloppy kisses. You really love that pup. But \u2026 is there any way to know if your dog loves you back?\n\nWell, first let\u2019s address the bigger question: does your dog love anything? Can your dog love?\n\nMarc Bekoff: \u201cI think we can, in many ways, apply the same criteria to dogs as we do to human animals.\u201d\n\nMarc Bekoff spent a lifetime understanding animal minds. From coyotes and wolves to domestic dogs like yours, and he says that dogs probably think and feel similar to humans.\n\nMarc Bekoff: \u201cA lot of new research on neuroimaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging- fMRI\u2019s, is showing that the same parts of dog brains and human brains light up when for example, they\u2019re feeling jealous.\u201d\n\nSo the difference between how your dog feels joy, and other emotions, and how you experience them, might be like the difference between you and another human. So dogs can likely experience what we\u2019d think of as loving relationships and studies show that dogs are pretty good at building relationships with us, too.\n\nOne study found that dog brains are highly adapted to recognizing human faces and interpreting our social cues. So, maybe that\u2019s how your dog always knows when you had a bad day.\n\nBut are those puppy dog eyes just for you or is your dog only pretending to love you for food?\n\nMarc Bekoff: \u201cThat, I think, is really ridiculous. Are there dogs who use people for certain things? I\u2019m sure there are, just like there are some people who use people for certain things. But i don\u2019t think that would characterize the overall nature of dog-human relationships.\u201d\n\nSo yes, your dog can love you!\n\nBut just because they can doesn\u2019t automatically mean they do.\n\nMarc Bekoff: \u201cTo say that they\u2019re unconditional lovers is just ridiculous. Each dog is a unique individual and it\u2019s not one-size-fits-all. Even the most brutally abused dogs I\u2019ve met who took months to get them to even make eye contact with me have the capacity to love. But there\u2019s just very good reasons why they don\u2019t. In order for you to feel the love, you have to earn that trust.\u201d\n\nAnd like everything worth having in life, that trust will take time and work. But it can be done.\n\nMarc Bekoff: \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes just telling them they\u2019re a good dog when they\u2019ve done nothing. I did a study about the frequency with which people say no, stop that, versus \u201cgood dog.\u201d\n\nAnd, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll know once you\u2019ve gotten to that special point in your relationship.\n\nMarc Bekoff: \u201cDo they follow you around, do they just hang out with you, not only when you\u2019re feeding them or walking them. Do they seek you out? When you\u2019re not there, is it clear that they miss you?\n\nOh yeah, that\u2019s one happy dog. So can your dog love you? Absolutely.\n\nDoes your dog love you? Well, that\u2019s on you.",

Meet the world\u2019s first dinosaur. No, down here! Eoraptor would\u2019ve only come up to about your knees. In fact, most early Triassic dinosaurs were on the shrimpy side. Including predators, like the fierce, mule-sized Coelophysis.\n\nBut, after volcanic eruptions took out their competitors and ushered in the Jurassic Period, everything changed. New species exploded onto the scene. Like the plate-covered Scelidosaurus. And bigger herbivores meant bigger meat eaters, too.\n\nPredators, like the Dilophosaurus, got to be 6 meters long! But they were no match for the real giants of the era: prosauropods. Now, these leaf-eaters weren\u2019t much bigger than a giraffe. On the inside, they looked like a bird. And it\u2019s this anatomy that enabled prosauropods to evolve into the largest dinosaurs of all time.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a closer look. Specialized lungs and air sacs allowed them to take in more oxygen. And also made their skeletons lighter hollowing out bone into a sturdy, honeycomb structure. Millions of years of evolution later, you can see the difference.\n\nOrnithischian dinosaurs like Triceratops and Stegosaurs, lacked these air sacs. And as a result\u00a0most of them weren\u2019t very big. While Triceratops and Stegosaurus grew up to 8 meters long bird-like theropods, like Tyrannosaurus, grew twice as large.\n\nBut it was the sauropods, like Brontosaurus, Diplodocus, and Brachiosaurus, who reached enormous proportions. Like the theropods, these titans used air sacs to breathe and had light, hollow bones. \n\nBut they had another reason for outgrowing everyone else at the time: survival. Their size was a great defense against predators. And the largest of the bunch, stood over 26 meters long, weighed 55 tons or more, and could reach several stories up with their long necks. Which came in handy for gathering enough food. After all, you can\u2019t grow this big without a lot of energy.\n\nIn fact, Brontosaurus ate about 45 kilograms of leaves, stems, and twigs a day. But they couldn\u2019t waste energy hunting around to find those veggies. Instead, they parked themselves in one spot for hours and used their long necks to graze up and down, stripping trees like a giant corn on the cob. And the more these animals sat around and ate, the bigger they became.\n\nTens of millions of years later, we see another birdlike dinosaur enter the stage: Titanosaurs. The largest dinosaurs in history. Dreadnoughtus, Patagotitan, and Argentinosaurus could stand over 20 meters long. \n\nBut of course, their height couldn\u2019t save them from the asteroid strike. And there\u2019s been nothing like them since at least on land, anyway.",

The loaf\u00a0of bread you bought a couple weeks ago is starting to grow mold and you're wondering \"Maybe I can just cut the part where I can see the mold and eat the clean part.\" It turns out, even though you cannot see it, your whole loaf of bread could be teaming with fungus. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nYou're all ready to make the sandwich of your dreams. Turkey, tomato, and swiss on a bed of romaine lettuce sandwiched between two slices of sourdough. Classic.\n\nOh no, what's this? Mold? But look, good new. The mold's only on part of the bread. So, I can just cut that away and be fine, right?\n\nThere's no such thing as a \"clean\" part of moldy bread. That's because mold is a fungus, like mushrooms. The caps on the surface are easy enough to spot. But there's a vast network of subterranean \"roots\" called hyphae that you can't see.\n\nSo let's take another look at that bread of yours. Ugh, disgusting!\n\nMaybe you can just grab another piece from the same loaf. Well, that's not such a great idea, either. Because by the time mold sprouts its fuzzy head, what you're really seeing is the reproductive part of the mold called sporangiums. Each sporangium releases tens of thousands of spores.\n\nSo, even though you can't see it, that entire loaf could be teeming with fungus.\n\nBut it seems like such a waste to just throw it out. After all, you eat mold on purpose all the time, like the mold that goes into making cheese, soy sauce, and even life-saving antibiotics, like penicillin. Eating a little bit on your bread can't be that bad, right?\n\nUltimately, it's a gamble. Just like eating a wild mushroom, many are fine. But some can be deadly.\n\nMold is the same way. There are thousands of different species of mold \u2014 many of which are harmless to humans. But since so many types can sprout up on food it's nearly impossible to know if what you're eating is safe.\n\nCladosporium, for example, can sometimes trigger allergies but is generally harmless. Whereas other molds, like Penicillium crustosum, produce harmful poisons called mycotoxins. An elderly couple in 2005, for example, was admitted to the hospital after eating a can of soup contaminated with this kind of mold. They had severe muscle tremors but eventually recovered.\n\nBut other molds, like Rhizopus stolonifer, can have permanent effects. And you might recognize this mold since it commonly grows on bread: blue-green, with black splotches, and super fuzzy. In rare cases, it can prompt a deadly infection called Zygomycosis, which causes your blood to clot and can, ultimately, starve your cells of oxygen to the point that they die.\n\nAnd it's not like bacteria where a little heat will eliminate the threat because high temperatures won't break down the mycotoxins.

Contact lenses are safe, but they're safe if you take care of them appropriately, and part of good contact lens hygiene is not sleeping in your contact lenses. Think of the contact lens as foreign material in your eye. It's sort of like a sponge, and to be comfortable, the contact lens needs to be moist, so, it absorbs moisture from your eye, and it can also trap bacteria, and so, it's very important to take your contact lenses out to clean them periodically.\n\nLeaving them in when you sleep can cause an eye infection that can sometimes be really, really bad. A lot of the infections can be mild and go away with antibiotic eye drops, but some infections can be really, really severe, and even if they go away, they can cause scarring of the surface of your eye, which is the cornea, and that scar can cause sort of a permanent change in your vision. Sometimes an infection can be devastating, and it can completely cause the eye to scar to the point that someone might need a corneal transplant or lose vision completely.\n\nReally serious blinding kind of infections related to contact lens wear are rare, fortunately. If they were common, then nobody would ever wear contact lenses. So, they are exceedingly rare, and they usually have to do with really, really bad contact lens hygiene. So, good contact lens hygiene has to do with a few things. One, knowing if your contact lens needs to be changed every month or every two weeks and trying to stick to that, even if you have to put a little reminder in your calendar. The more common thing that we see is just contact lens overwear. The cornea gets devoid of oxygen. So, a contact lens does start to break down over time so it doesn't have a smooth surface. It's gonna form micro-breakdown kind of edges, and the contact lens will also dry out. I mean, your eye just doesn't have enough moisture to keep a contact lens in there forever.\n\nIf you think of the contact lens as a sponge, like the sponge in your kitchen, you have to clean it every so often, and you might even have to replace it every so often, because it just doesn't do the job right anymore. A contact lens can become kind of folded and entrapped in the eye underneath the lid, so, I have seen that where patients come in with chronic red eye, and you look around very carefully and sometimes, and this is also rare, but you can actually extract a contact lens that has probably been there for months.\n\nIt can happen if you put it in wrong. It can happen if you sleep in it. It can happen if you don't take it out, or if you forget to take it out. Take your contact lenses out. Don't leave them in. Take them out every day.",

But these three scientific theories might give us an idea about why we seem to come up empty-handed in our search for other intelligent life across the universe.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\nNarrator: Odds are, somewhere among the estimated 100 billion planets in our galaxy, intelligent alien life has taken hold. So the question is, why haven\u2019t we found even a hint of it? While scientists could stick with the classic reasoning that alien life simply doesn\u2019t exist, or maybe it just doesn\u2019t exist near us, mounting evidence to the contrary has inspired an increasing number of experts to explore new avenues of possibility.\n\nIn 2017 a team out of the University of Oxford proposed the Aestivation Hypothesis. It\u2019s the idea that most aliens are hibernating, sort of like a bear but for longer. The scientists reason that just about any advanced civilization will eventually merge with machines, forming a fully digitized society that can think, act, and function on levels beyond our imagination. The only problem with that is cooling. Processing systems here on Earth, for example, become 10 times more efficient when they\u2019re in an environment that is 10 times colder. So digital aliens would see the logic of hibernating for a few trillion years or so while the universe expands and cools. That way, they can then devote more processing power toward important activities, like conquering the galaxy, instead of simply keeping their systems from overheating.\n\nAnother idea proposed in 2016 is what\u2019s called the Gaian Bottleneck Hypothesis. It addresses the fact that many young rocky planets no older than one billion years have extremely unstable climates, and eventually grow too hot or too cold for life to exist long-term. Take Venus, Earth, and Mars, for example. Four billion years ago, each planet had the right conditions for life, and may have even harbored simple microorganisms. But as far as we can tell, only life on Earth survives today; the reason, according to the Bottleneck Hypothesis, is that early life on Earth evolved rapidly, releasing large amounts of gases like oxygen into the atmosphere that ultimately helped stabilize the climate. But this behavior is likely the exception than the norm. So perhaps the real reason we haven\u2019t found aliens yet is because, well, they\u2019re all dead.\n\nBut what if life could flourish in a completely different environment, safe from extreme temperature fluctuations and radiation? That\u2019s what planetary scientist Alan Stern proposed in 2017, about a year after evidence suggested that Pluto harbors an underground ocean. In fact, worlds like Pluto, Europa, and Enceladus, that have an icy shell above a vast subterranean ocean, may offer a better incubator for life than Earth-like planets, which are more vulnerable to extreme temperature changes and high-energy radiation that strikes the surface. If this turns out to be the case, any intelligent life that may be swimming on these worlds would be shut off from the rest of the universe, potentially unable to communicate.\n\nWhatever the reason may be, we must answer the question of how we can improve our search for what would be the grandest discovery in human history.",

That way, they can then devote more processing power toward important activities, like conquering the galaxy, instead of simply keeping their systems from overheating.\n\nAnother idea proposed in 2016 is what\u2019s called the Gaian Bottleneck Hypothesis. It addresses the fact that many young rocky planets no older than one billion years have extremely unstable climates, and eventually grow too hot or too cold for life to exist long-term. Take Venus, Earth, and Mars, for example. Four billion years ago, each planet had the right conditions for life, and may have even harbored simple microorganisms. But as far as we can tell, only life on Earth survives today; the reason, according to the Bottleneck Hypothesis, is that early life on Earth evolved rapidly, releasing large amounts of gases like oxygen into the atmosphere that ultimately helped stabilize the climate. But this behavior is likely the exception than the norm. So perhaps the real reason we haven\u2019t found aliens yet is because, well, they\u2019re all dead.\n\nBut what if life could flourish in a completely different environment, safe from extreme temperature fluctuations and radiation? That\u2019s what planetary scientist Alan Stern proposed in 2017, about a year after evidence suggested that Pluto harbors an underground ocean. In fact, worlds like Pluto, Europa, and Enceladus, that have an icy shell above a vast subterranean ocean, may offer a better incubator for life than Earth-like planets, which are more vulnerable to extreme temperature changes and high-energy radiation that strikes the surface. If this turns out to be the case, any intelligent life that may be swimming on these worlds would be shut off from the rest of the universe, potentially unable to communicate.\n\nWhatever the reason may be, we must answer the question of how we can improve our search for what would be the grandest discovery in human history."

These titans roam the oceans in search of food, but that wasn't\u00a0always the case. Millions of years ago they used to be land dwellers. Here is how whales ended up becoming the biggest of them all.\u00a0\u00a0Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nWhales are the biggest animals of all time. Heavier than elephants, wooly mammoths, and even dinosaurs!\n\nBut they weren\u2019t always the titans of the sea. Let\u2019s rewind the clock around 50 million years. No, you won\u2019t find any whales here. You have to go ashore. Meet Pakicetus. The very first whale.\n\nLife on Earth spent millions of years clawing its way out of the oceans. But whales took all that effort and threw it out the window. From 50 to 40 million years ago they traded in their four legs for flippers. In fact, some whales today still have leftover bones of hind legs!\n\nOnce submerged, their weight under gravity no longer mattered so they could theoretically grow to enormous proportions. And they did. Today, a blue whale is 10 THOUSAND times more massive than the Pakicetus was.\n\nBut this transformation wasn\u2019t as gradual as you might think. In fact, over the next 37 million years or so whales grew increasingly diverse but their size remained small. And were only 18 feet long. Making them easy prey for predators, like giant sharks.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until around 3 million years ago that an ice age tipped the scales in the whales\u2019 favor. Ocean temperatures and currents shifted sparking concentrated swarms of plankton and plankton-seeking krill. It was an all-you-can-eat buffet for the baleen whales, who grew larger as a result. And the larger they became, the farther they could travel in search of more food to grow even more. You can probably see where this is going.\n\n3 million years later, humpbacks, for example, have one of the longest migrations of any mammal on Earth, traveling over 5,000 miles each year. As a result, modern whales are the largest they\u2019ve ever been in history.\n\nTake the biggest of the bunch the blue whale. It weighs more than a Boeing 757. Has a belly button the size of a plate. And its network of blood vessels, if you laid them out in a line, could stretch from Pluto to the sun and back over two and a half times!\n\nIn fact, the largest blue whales are so huge that scientists think they may have hit a physical limit. When they open their wide mouths to feed they engulf enough water to fill a large living room. So it can take as long as 10 seconds to close them again.\n\nScientists estimate once a whale is 110 feet long it can\u2019t close its mouth fast enough before prey escapes. So it\u2019s possible we\u2019re living amongst the largest animal that will ever exist. Lucky for us, they mostly just eat krill.\n\nThis was made in large part thanks to Nick Pyenson and the information in his new book, \u201cSpying on Whales.\u201d",

Humans are still evolving new traits that help us survive and thrive in a changing world.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nOn the outside, it may seem like we haven\u2019t changed much from our early ancestors. But take a closer look and you\u2019ll discover that humans are still evolving in some fascinating new ways.\n\nHOLDING YOUR BREATH\nThe average person can hold their breath for 30 seconds. But Bajau people in Southeast Asia can hold it up to 12 minutes! Which comes in handy when they freedive over 230 feet for food.\n\nPart of the reason is simply training and experience, since they spend over half their work day underwater But it turns out the Bajau also have a genetic mutation that makes their spleens 50% larger than average.\n\nOur spleens are what filter and store oxygen-rich red blood cells. So, when the Bajau dive underwater their larger spleens contract, which boosts oxygen levels in the blood by up to 10%, allowing them more time to collect food. It\u2019s a handy adaptation that probably came from living on houseboats for the last 1,000 years.\n\nDRINKING MILK\nAbout 35% of the world\u2019s population has the equivalent of a genetic superpower: They can digest milk as adults. Not impressed? Then consider this: humans are the ONLY mammals on the planet with this ability.\n\nThanks to a genetic mutation that popped up in Europe around 5 to 10 thousand years ago. Those with the mutation produce lactase throughout their lives. That\u2019s the enzyme that breaks down milk sugars for easy digestion.\n\nAll other mammals, and humans for most of history, stop producing it after childhood.\n\nBut once those lucky few Europeans could drink milk as adults, that suddenly meant extra nutrition and ultimately healthier, longer lives so that they could pass their superpower on to future generations.\n\nToday, roughly 95% of Northern Europeans have the mutation.\n\nFENDING OFF DISEASE\nThe human body has an estimated 20 to 30 thousand genes. And while some mutations can change our spleens and diet others can protect us against deadly conditions, like AIDS.\n\nNearly 50% of women in parts of South Africa have HIV. But researchers found that some show a stronger resistance to the virus taking longer to develop AIDS, or sometimes never getting it at all.\n\nTurns out, these women also share a mutation in a gene called HLA-B27, that the others lack.\n\nDoes this mean we're going to evolve our way to HIV immunity? It\u2019s too early to say. But one thing\u2019s clear:\n\nEvolution\u2019s not done with us yet.",

                    "description": "Evolution gave humanity powerful brains, flat feet, and opposable thumbs. But it's not through with us yet. Humans are still evolving new traits that help us survive and thrive in a changing world.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nOn the outside, it may seem like we haven\u2019t changed much from our early ancestors. But take a closer look and you\u2019ll discover that humans are still evolving in some fascinating new ways.\n\nHOLDING YOUR BREATH\nThe average person can hold their breath for 30 seconds. But Bajau people in Southeast Asia can hold it up to 12 minutes! Which comes in handy when they freedive over 230 feet for food.\n\nPart of the reason is simply training and experience, since they spend over half their work day underwater But it turns out the Bajau also have a genetic mutation that makes their spleens 50% larger than average.\n\nOur spleens are what filter and store oxygen-rich red blood cells. So, when the Bajau dive underwater their larger spleens contract, which boosts oxygen levels in the blood by up to 10%, allowing them more time to collect food. It\u2019s a handy adaptation that probably came from living on houseboats for the last 1,000 years.\n\nDRINKING MILK\nAbout 35% of the world\u2019s population has the equivalent of a genetic superpower: They can digest milk as adults. Not impressed? Then consider this: humans are the ONLY mammals on the planet with this ability.\n\nThanks to a genetic mutation that popped up in Europe around 5 to 10 thousand years ago. Those with the mutation produce lactase throughout their lives. That\u2019s the enzyme that breaks down milk sugars for easy digestion.\n\nAll other mammals, and humans for most of history, stop producing it after childhood.\n\nBut once those lucky few Europeans could drink milk as adults, that suddenly meant extra nutrition and ultimately healthier, longer lives so that they could pass their superpower on to future generations.\n\nToday, roughly 95% of Northern Europeans have the mutation.\n\nFENDING OFF DISEASE\nThe human body has an estimated 20 to 30 thousand genes. And while some mutations can change our spleens and diet others can protect us against deadly conditions, like AIDS.\n\nNearly 50% of women in parts of South Africa have HIV. But researchers found that some show a stronger resistance to the virus taking longer to develop AIDS, or sometimes never getting it at all.\n\nTurns out, these women also share a mutation in a gene called HLA-B27, that the others lack.\n\nDoes this mean we're going to evolve our way to HIV immunity? It\u2019s too early to say. But one thing\u2019s clear:\n\nEvolution\u2019s not done with us yet."

                "description": "Artificial sweeteners are one of diet soda\u2019s main ingredients. But studies have shown that the artificial sweeteners within diet sodas can cause a series of health problems. We decided to take a look at what happens to the body when you only drink diet soda. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nIn the early 1960s, a new kind of beverage took the stage.It wasn\u2019t a new shape, or color, or flavor. No, this was diet soda. And It. Was. Awesome.\n\nWith fewer calories and less sugar, diet soda promised to be a healthier alternative to regular soda. But like most promises in life that sound too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nCan you tell the difference between a glass of regular and diet soda? Turns out, neither can your body. And that\u2019s where the trouble starts.\n\nUntil recently, everything we ate contained some amount of calories. When we ate something sweet, for example, the brain sent signals to our pancreas. Which started producing insulin, that stored the sugar molecules in our cells for energy.\n\nSo, when we drink diet soda, the sweetness tricks our body into thinking it\u2019s real sugar. But when those energy-packed calories don\u2019t arrive, the insulin has nothing to store.\n\nScientists think that repeatedly tricking our body this way could explain why study after study keeps finding the same thing: that drinking diet soda is associated with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a mix of conditions that includes: increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, and weight gain. Which can increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.\n\nIn fact, one study found that diet soda drinkers had a higher risk of stroke and dementia than regular soda drinkers. And for another 8-year-long study between 1979-1988, participants who started out at a normal weight and drank an average of 21 diet beverages a week faced DOUBLE the risk of becoming overweight or obese by the end of the study, compared to people who avoided diet beverages completely.\n\nAnd while drinking diet soda with a meal may sound like a tasty, calorie-free alternative to plain water, a growing body of research is starting to find that this may be the WORST time to drink it. Because the fake calories in the diet soda could ultimately disrupt how many of the real calories we metabolize. Potentially leaving excess calories behind that we then store as fat.\n\nAnother issue could be the fact that artificial sweeteners in diet sodas can be tens to hundreds of times sweeter than sugar. So when we taste it, our brains anticipate more calories than what we give it. It\u2019s like when you go to a party expecting loads of food and you end up with a handful of veggies and vegan cheese. You\u2019re left unsatisfied and hangry. In the same way, artificial sweeteners can leave our brains wanting more, which studies have shown leads to increased appetite, and potential weight gain, in fruit flies, mice, and humans.\n\nSo if the reason you\u2019re drinking diet soda is to drop a few pounds, maybe stick to water.\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider",

Polar bears follow his every order. The name Mr. Big strikes fear into the heart of many a predator in Zootopia.\nAs well it should, Mr. Big, after all, is an arctic shrew. And shrews are fearsome predators.\n\nTurns out some of the most formidable hunters in nature, come in surprising packages.\n\nQuick, think of a fearsome predator. What comes to mind? Crocodiles? Cobras? Tigers? You might not think to flee at the sight of this Northern short-tailed shrew. And that would be a mistake.\n\nThese tiny guys can take down prey over twice their size with a single bite. Their secret? Venomous spit. In fact, these shrews are one of the only mammals on Earth with a toxic bite. But even they can\u2019t contend with our next hunter, the mongoose.\n\nThey mostly dine on insects, small reptiles, birds, and rodents. But some species also go after deadlier prey. Like cobras, mambas, and other venomous snakes. And sure, it takes guts to battle a full-hooded cobra but there\u2019s more to this bravery than meets the eye. These mongooses are resistant to neurotoxins in snake venom. Normally, the toxins bind to muscle cell receptors which blocks signals from the brain, causing paralysis. But certain mongooses have specially shaped receptors that fend off the toxins.\n\nNext up, the giant otter. On average, they\u2019re about as long as a human man is tall. And usually, prefer prey like catfish and piranhas. But on rare occasions, they\u2019ve been known to go after anacondas and croc-like caimans at least twice their length. And they don\u2019t even have any secret weapons, like toxic saliva, for help! Just their fellow otters since they sometimes hunt in groups.\n\nBut believe it or not, there\u2019s another type of weasel who goes after even bigger quarry. The Wolverine. Wolverines are about the size of a border collie. And have been known to hunt caribou! They like to ambush their prey and when that doesn\u2019t work, they have the gall to try and steal prey from larger predators like wolves and bears.\n\nLast but certainly not least is perhaps the most unsuspecting predator of them all. Meet the Epomis beetle. Right after birth, these hungry larvae are already on the hunt. Frogs, toads, and salamanders are a tasty meal. But the newborns can\u2019t just chase these large meals down. Instead, they lure their prey by tricking it into attacking them. Then, they swing around, sink their hooked jaws into the flesh, and latch on. Mmm, lunch time!\n\nWhether you\u2019re dealing with a beetle or a weasel, the lesson\u2019s clear, size isn\u2019t everything. Are there any unsuspecting predators we missed?

                "description": "Some of the world\u2019s deadliest animals have venom that's thousands of times more toxic than cyanide and can kill a human in minutes. Brown snakes, funnel web spiders, and blue-ringed octopuses are among the animals that you do not want to mess with. We spoke with Steve Trim at Venomtech (www.venomtech.co.uk) who helped us rank some of the deadliest bites to humans on Earth.\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nYou\u2019ve been bitten! And uh oh, it\u2019s venomous! How long have you got?\n\nWell, that depends on a few factors including the potency, dose delivered and speed of distribution. Turns out, not all Venoms act the same way. Here are the animals with the fastest-acting venom on Earth.\n\nFirst up: spiders.\n\nThere are around 40,000 species of spider and most are venomous. But, thankfully, only a handful pose a threat to humans. Including the male Sydney funnel-web spider.\n\nIts venom is 60 times as potent as cyanide and can kill a human in 1-2 hours. The venom attacks the nervous system kicking it into overdrive until \u2014 ultimately \u2014 it shuts down!\n\nOf course, spiders aren\u2019t the only venomous animals in Australia. It\u2019s home to 20 of the world\u2019s 25 deadliest snakes. Including the Eastern brown snake, which is responsible for the most snakebite deaths in the country.\n\nIts venom is 8,000 times stronger than cyanide and can kill a human in about one hour. Its venom also attacks the central nervous system but this time it slows everything down.\n\nAnd to top it off, the venom has a coagulant that causes the blood in your veins and arteries to clot. Between the two, it\u2019s not a good way to go.\n\nNow, at this point, you might consider switching your Australian safari to a scuba dive just to be on the safe side. But, turns out venomous animals live in Australian waters too.\n\nLike the blue-ringed octopus.\n\nIts venom is 1,000 times more toxic than cyanide and it\u2019ll bring down a human in just 20-40 minutes. Bacteria in its saliva make an extremely potent neurotoxin which paralyzes your muscles. And once that paralysis hits your diaphragm and rib muscles, you only have a few minutes before you suffocate to death.\n\nNo, the fastest-acting venom on Earth belongs to the Australian Box Jellyfish or sea wasp.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most potent venom out there. But encounter one of these guys and you\u2019ll be dead in 15 minutes.\n\nThat\u2019s all because of these things They\u2019re COVERED with tiny, venom-loaded darts, called nematocysts.\n\nWhich shoot heart-stopping toxins into the body wherever they make contact.\n\nAll of this sounds pretty scary, but remember you\u2019re less likely to die by venomous snails than by car crashes, an infection, or disease.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like these animals are after you anyways. They\u2019d just as well prefer that you stick to your own habitat.\n\nBut still be smart, be respectful, be safe.",

                    "description": "Some of the world\u2019s deadliest animals have venom that's thousands of times more toxic than cyanide and can kill a human in minutes. Brown snakes, funnel web spiders, and blue-ringed octopuses are among the animals that you do not want to mess with. We spoke with Steve Trim at Venomtech (www.venomtech.co.uk) who helped us rank some of the deadliest bites to humans on Earth.\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nYou\u2019ve been bitten! And uh oh, it\u2019s venomous! How long have you got?\n\nWell, that depends on a few factors including the potency, dose delivered and speed of distribution. Turns out, not all Venoms act the same way. Here are the animals with the fastest-acting venom on Earth.\n\nFirst up: spiders.\n\nThere are around 40,000 species of spider and most are venomous. But, thankfully, only a handful pose a threat to humans. Including the male Sydney funnel-web spider.\n\nIts venom is 60 times as potent as cyanide and can kill a human in 1-2 hours. The venom attacks the nervous system kicking it into overdrive until \u2014 ultimately \u2014 it shuts down!\n\nOf course, spiders aren\u2019t the only venomous animals in Australia. It\u2019s home to 20 of the world\u2019s 25 deadliest snakes. Including the Eastern brown snake, which is responsible for the most snakebite deaths in the country.\n\nIts venom is 8,000 times stronger than cyanide and can kill a human in about one hour. Its venom also attacks the central nervous system but this time it slows everything down.\n\nAnd to top it off, the venom has a coagulant that causes the blood in your veins and arteries to clot. Between the two, it\u2019s not a good way to go.\n\nNow, at this point, you might consider switching your Australian safari to a scuba dive just to be on the safe side. But, turns out venomous animals live in Australian waters too.\n\nLike the blue-ringed octopus.\n\nIts venom is 1,000 times more toxic than cyanide and it\u2019ll bring down a human in just 20-40 minutes. Bacteria in its saliva make an extremely potent neurotoxin which paralyzes your muscles. And once that paralysis hits your diaphragm and rib muscles, you only have a few minutes before you suffocate to death.\n\nNo, the fastest-acting venom on Earth belongs to the Australian Box Jellyfish or sea wasp.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most potent venom out there. But encounter one of these guys and you\u2019ll be dead in 15 minutes.\n\nThat\u2019s all because of these things They\u2019re COVERED with tiny, venom-loaded darts, called nematocysts.\n\nWhich shoot heart-stopping toxins into the body wherever they make contact.\n\nAll of this sounds pretty scary, but remember you\u2019re less likely to die by venomous snails than by car crashes, an infection, or disease.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like these animals are after you anyways. They\u2019d just as well prefer that you stick to your own habitat.\n\nBut still be smart, be respectful, be safe."

And it\u2019s no wonder! Dinosaurs dominated the planet for 135 million years. But they didn\u2019t start out on top.\n\nThe first dinosaurs emerged around 230 million years ago during the Triassic Period. Back then, Earth looked very different. Instead of 7 continents, there was just one: Pangea. Even early dinosaurs were nothing like those Hollywood giants.\n\nEoraptor, possibly the first true dinosaur, was puny. Especially compared to top predators of the day like some of the giant rauisuchians. Over the next 30 million years, new species of dinosaurs and amphibians developed along with the first mammals. Life was flourishing.\n\nThen, 201 million years ago, everything changed. Pangea began to tear apart. The shifting tectonic plates sparked volcanic eruptions, which \u2014 over tens of thousands years \u2014 TRIPLED the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and warmed the planet by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius. It vanquished at least 30% of all life in the process.\n\nBut for some reason, maybe luck, or some helpful adaptation the dinosaurs sailed on through to the dawn of the Jurassic Period. And over the next 135 million years, they continued to spread, diversify, and evolve into some familiar faces. For example, the first tyrannosaurs sprouted up sometime around 170 million years ago. But don\u2019t get your hopes up these guys were no T. rex.\n\nTurns out, the REAL sovereign of the era was the Allosaurus. Longer than a double decker bus, it dined on sauropods with its meat cleaver teeth. Meanwhile, Pangea continued to pull apart. By 145 million years ago it began to resemble what we see today. Forming isolated pockets, where dinosaurs grew increasingly different from each other. It was the heyday of dinosaur diversity. And a new period: The Cretaceous.\n\nMeanwhile, in Argentina, giants like Patagotitan \u2014 the biggest dinosaur on record \u2014 turned up around 100 million years ago. But the most frightening of all appeared in the Western US around 68 million years ago. T. rex. The largest carnivore in history. On its own, it was a formidable predator but it turns out the T. rex likely hunted in packs.\n\nAnd where T. Rex did not roam, other pack hunters filled the niche. For example, in Asia, the small, yet cunning, velociraptor roamed. It was a bad time to be a mammal. And then, 66 million years ago, the Chicxulub asteroid wiped out all the dinosaurs well, almost all of them. One group remained.

That sharp searing pain in your forehead! But you know what\u2019s even worse? Not everyone gets it!\u00a0That\u2019s right, some people can suck down as many milkshakes as they want and never feel a thing. Life is so unfair.\n\nAnd you know what else? These lucky people are ruining it for scientists, too. Brain freeze is one of those scientific mysteries that\u2019s been around since the 1800s. Just throw it in there with UFOs and crop circles. We may never know the real reason behind them!\n\nOk, maybe that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration. But here\u2019s the thing: The leading theories for what causes a brain freeze have to do with a physical response that everyone should feel.\n\nThe way scientists think it works is this: Brain freeze happens when something cold hits the roof of your mouth, where it triggers your trigeminal nerve. It\u2019s the nerve in charge of sensations you feel around the front of your head. That\u2019s why, when you freeze it to subzero temperatures, the pain is around the temples and forehead.\n\nIn fact, different nerves cause pain in different parts of your head. A toothache, for example, can irritate the mandibular nerve, causing pain near the central skull. But when it comes to a brain freeze the source of the pain is different from most other headaches.\n\nTurns out, it\u2019s more similar to why your feet and hands sting when they get too cold. Your body floods that area with blood to try and return it to body temperature and in the process, your blood vessels expand, which causes that throbbing pain.\n\nSimilarly, during a brain freeze, blood vessels in your brain widen, sending a rush of blood to the roof of your mouth and, in the process, cause pain.\n\nNow, the trigeminal nerve is a natural part of the body. So, if it\u2019s the real cause of brain freeze, then that means everyone should get it. So why do scientists estimate that only 37% Americans actually feel it? And for that matter, 41% of children in Taiwan and only 15% of the adults in Denmark, according to another study?\n\nResearchers can only speculate: Maybe the trigeminal nerve is less sensitive in certain demographics. One thing that does seem to be clear is that people who do experience brain freeze may also be more susceptible to another kind of mysterious headache: migraines.\n\nIn one small study, 93% of migraine patients were also prone to brain freeze. Which has led researchers to suspect that the trigeminal nerve also plays a key role in migraines.\n\nWhatever the reason, just hang in there. Brain freeze usually only last 20-30 seconds. Go ahead and take that time to remember not to slurp so quickly next time.",

It turns out, night owls have an internal clock that functions differently. Forcing them to wake up early could have serious health consequences.\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nThere is plenty of advice for how to improve your sleep. Go to bed at the same time. Avoid digital screens after dark. And don\u2019t hit snooze. But it all comes down to the same assumption: That YOU\u2019RE doing something wrong. When, in fact, it may not be your fault, at all.\n\nInside practically every organism on Earth there\u2019s a clock that keeps order. Known as the circadian rhythm. For humans, it\u2019s located in the part of our brains called the hypothalamus. And while it\u2019s most famous for controlling our sleep cycles\u2026 it\u2019s also responsible for helping primary organs like the brain, heart, and lungs, work in harmony. But not everyone\u2019s circadian rhythm is the same. Night owls, for instance, generally feel tired later than early birds. Often because they produce high amounts of the sleep hormone, melatonin, later at night.\n\nAnd for most of human history that didn\u2019t matter \u2014 since night owls could protect their tribes from nocturnal predators or their cities from cunning conquerors \u2014 but society has MADE it a problem in recent decades. An estimated 80% of Americans follow daily schedules that fall between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Yet, nearly a third of the population considers themselves night owls. Which means they\u2019d be better off with a schedule that looks more like this. This phenomenon is called social jetlag. It\u2019s like the jetlag you feel after a long plane trip\u2026 but worse because it doesn\u2019t disappear after a few days.\n\nAnd social jetlag is taking its toll on night owls of the world. Because, even if you get the recommended amount of sleep\u2026 knocking your circadian rhythm out of whack has consequences. For example, one study found that for every hour your circadian rhythm is out of syn \u2026your risk of obesity increases by 33%. Also increasing your risk of the many health complications associated with obesity. And the problem isn\u2019t just a physical one. In another study, people whose circadian rhythms were more than 2 hours off\u2026 reported notably more severe symptoms of depression.\n\nAnd since your circadian rhythm tends to shift as you age\u2026 social jetlag is especially apparent in teens. In fact, the CDC warns that most public schools across America start too early, before 8:30. Which, according to the nonprofit \u201cRand Corporation,\u201d is costing the country $9 billion a year from mainly lost academic performance and car crashes from tired teens behind the wheel. Luckily, the circadian rhythm isn\u2019t set in stone. Turns out, it\u2019s largely triggered by light signals that strike your eye. So, when you first wake up, get outside and soak up some morning sun\u2026 or if that\u2019s out of the question, make sure your home is well lit. It might just brighten your morning a little more.",

Helium is much lighter than air, so sound waves move much faster through the gas. This amplifies the higher frequencies in your voice. The gas sulfur hexaflouride works in the opposite way.\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nIt\u2019s a classic party trick- suck down a balloon and you\u2019ll sound like Daffy Duck every time. But helium isn\u2019t the only gas that\u2019ll change the way you talk. So what\u2019s going on here?\n\nYour voice is as unique as your fingerprint. Janice didn\u2019t inhale a balloon full of helium. That\u2019s just her \u201cnormal\u201d voice. So, let's take a look at how that's even possible. The sound of your voice starts in your voice box, or larynx. It\u2019s a two-inch piece of cartilage at the top of your throat. In the box are two stretchy strands of tissue, your vocal cords. Which vibrate against each other at a specific frequency when you talk.\n\nWomen generally have thinner, shorter, tighter vocal cords than men. So, their vocal cords vibrate faster which generates a higher pitched voice. That sound is called the fundamental frequency of your voice. On its own it just sounds like a simple buzzing. But when it reaches your vocal tract, the sound waves start bouncing around. Those reflections interfere with each other. Which creates a mix of other frequencies, that you can detect with a spectrograph. So even though your voice starts out as one frequency, it ends up as a mix of multiple ones.\n\nAnd that's where helium comes into play. Helium is lighter than air. Which means sound moves faster throught helium than through air \u2013 nearly 3 times faster, in fact. So the sound waves bounce around faster in your vocal tract, which amplifies the higher frequencies in your voice. It's sort of like how speeding up your voice makes it sound higher.\n\nBut hold on a sec. These people aren't inhaling helium. They're sucking down sulfur hexafluoride, which is six times heavier than air. So sound waves move slower through it, which amplifies the lower frequencies in your voice. But here's the fascinating thing. The pitch of your voice hasn't changed when you inahle either gas, because your vocal cords move at the same rate no matter what gas you're breathing. So your fundamental frequency stays, well fundamental.\n\nRegardless of whether you want to sound like Daffy Duck or James Earl Jones, keep in mind that inhaling anything but air can be dangerous. Especially when the gas is denser than air, because it will sink to the bottom of your lungs. And you may have to get it out like this. What questions do you have about the human body? Let us know in the comments and thanks for watching.",

                    "description": "Inhaling helium and talking like Daffy Duck is a classic party trick. But not many know how helium works. Helium is much lighter than air, so sound waves move much faster through the gas. This amplifies the higher frequencies in your voice. The gas sulfur hexaflouride works in the opposite way.\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nIt\u2019s a classic party trick- suck down a balloon and you\u2019ll sound like Daffy Duck every time. But helium isn\u2019t the only gas that\u2019ll change the way you talk. So what\u2019s going on here?\n\nYour voice is as unique as your fingerprint. Janice didn\u2019t inhale a balloon full of helium. That\u2019s just her \u201cnormal\u201d voice. So, let's take a look at how that's even possible. The sound of your voice starts in your voice box, or larynx. It\u2019s a two-inch piece of cartilage at the top of your throat. In the box are two stretchy strands of tissue, your vocal cords. Which vibrate against each other at a specific frequency when you talk.\n\nWomen generally have thinner, shorter, tighter vocal cords than men. So, their vocal cords vibrate faster which generates a higher pitched voice. That sound is called the fundamental frequency of your voice. On its own it just sounds like a simple buzzing. But when it reaches your vocal tract, the sound waves start bouncing around. Those reflections interfere with each other. Which creates a mix of other frequencies, that you can detect with a spectrograph. So even though your voice starts out as one frequency, it ends up as a mix of multiple ones.\n\nAnd that's where helium comes into play. Helium is lighter than air. Which means sound moves faster throught helium than through air \u2013 nearly 3 times faster, in fact. So the sound waves bounce around faster in your vocal tract, which amplifies the higher frequencies in your voice. It's sort of like how speeding up your voice makes it sound higher.\n\nBut hold on a sec. These people aren't inhaling helium. They're sucking down sulfur hexafluoride, which is six times heavier than air. So sound waves move slower through it, which amplifies the lower frequencies in your voice. But here's the fascinating thing. The pitch of your voice hasn't changed when you inahle either gas, because your vocal cords move at the same rate no matter what gas you're breathing. So your fundamental frequency stays, well fundamental.\n\nRegardless of whether you want to sound like Daffy Duck or James Earl Jones, keep in mind that inhaling anything but air can be dangerous. Especially when the gas is denser than air, because it will sink to the bottom of your lungs. And you may have to get it out like this. What questions do you have about the human body? Let us know in the comments and thanks for watching."

What would life be like on these 'super-Earths'? And if we ever got there... would we be able to leave?\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is the transcript of the video:\n\nAstronomers have found dozens of potentially habitable planets outside of our solar system.\n\nThat\u2019s dozens of chances to discover the first alien life! Or plenty of places we could park our first interstellar colonies!\n\nBut with so many options, how do we know which is best? You might think the most Earth-like planets should be top of our list. After all, we've got water, land, an atmosphere, and trillions of life forms lapping it all up.\n\nBut according to a small group of researchers, there are bigger and better planets out there. They\u2019re called super-Earths.\n\nSuper-Earths may be some of the most common planets in our galaxy. Since 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has discovered about 4,000 exoplanets. 30% of them are super-earths. And a few percent of those super-earths orbit within their host star\u2019s habitable zone:\n\nThat\u2019s a Goldilocks zone where the planet\u2019s surface is just the right temperature for liquid water.\u00a0Not too cold or too hot.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a chance that some of these super-Earth\u2019s aren\u2019t rocky worlds like Earth.\u00a0The larger ones could be made of mostly hydrogen and helium gas like Jupiter and Saturn which would not be hospitable for life.\n\nBut the reality is, astronomers are still gathering details as more data comes in. So, in the meantime, we\u2019ll explore what life on a rocky, habitable super-Earth might be like.\n\nLiquid water is just the start. These planets can be almost double Earth\u2019s radius and up to 10 times more massive. And all that extra mass is what researchers think could really make super-Earth\u2019s the perfect home. Because more massive planets have a stronger gravitational pull.\n\nSuper-Earth Kepler 20b, for example, is nearly double the size of Earth and is 10 times more massive. Making its surface gravity almost 3 times stronger. That stronger gravity means the planet can hold on to more air molecules forming a thicker atmosphere.\n\nWhich is great for protection against harmful space radiation. It also means mountains and hills would erode faster leaving a relatively flatter surface compared to Earth.\u00a0Which might sound boring but scientists think this could actually spawn dozens of shallow islands across the planet.\n\nWhich, in turn, could be the perfect place for life to form and evolve. \u201cJust as biodiversity in Earth\u2019s oceans is richest in shallow waters near coastlines, such an \u2018archipelago world\u2019 might be enormously advantageous to life.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem leaving this tropical paradise would be extremely difficult. The escape velocity on Kepler 20b is more than double compared to Earth\u2019s. Which means either rockets would need more fuel to reach their destinations. For example, a mission similar to the Apollo moon landings would require twice the amount of fuel or, rockets could only carry a fraction of the payload.\n\nFor instance, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy can launch 50,000 kilograms of payload into Earth\u2019s orbit whereas it could only launch 40 kilograms into orbit around a super-Earth like Kepler 20b. That\u2019s about the weight of a German Shepherd.\n\nSuffice it to say, leaving a super-Earth would be a far greater challenge. But if it looked like this, would you really want to say goodbye? We\u2019ll never know for sure until we visit one.\n\nWhat do you want to know about space? Leave your queries in the comments below.\n\nAnd thanks for watching.",

That\u2019s the trouble with growing tall. Gravity\u2019s pull is keeping us all down. But there are a few earthly giants that have fought gravity and won.\n\nThe key to growing tall is how you use your energy. That\u2019s why the tallest trees outrank any animal on Earth. Because trees spend all their energy on one thing- growing taller than their fellow neighbors. And there are two trees that are the best growers of them all- giant Redwoods and Mountain Ashes. Redwoods are renowned as the tallest life forms on Earth. But some experts think that Mountain Ashes could grow even taller if humans would stop cutting them down. In fact, the tallest Mountain Ash was just 1 meter shorter than the tallest Redwood.\n\nUnlike plants, animals spend energy on all sorts of tasks like eating, walking, and staying warm. So, they can't grow as tall. But it doesn't mean they're small, either. If you measured this African Elephant from shoulder to ground it would actually be taller than a Giraffe! But thanks to their long, strong necks, giraffes are the tallest animals alive.\n\nAnd if we look at animals throughout Earth\u2019s history, dinosaurs eclipse them all. These towering Sauropods were the biggest of the bunch. In fact, the top 10 list of tallest animals in history? All dinosaurs.\n\nBut, what if we looked at the longest lifeforms too? If you balance the longest Saltwater Crocodile on its nose, it would tie the Giraffe! And if we ignore legs, it gets even better! Tip to tail, the Green Anaconda nearly doubles the height of the tallest Giraffe on record.\n\nBut these land dwellers have nothing on animals of the deep. Supported by water, sea life can practically ignore gravity. Which means they can grow much larger. Take the Blue Whale for example. It\u2019s the most massive animal of all time. The entire cast of Broadway\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d can fit on its tongue! But it should be careful not to get tangled up in the tentacles of a Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish, which makes a Giant Squid look small by comparison. Now, the biggest fish alive is the Whale Shark. And if we look into the past, things get even bigger.\n\nAnd where do humans fit into all this? Somewhere near the top, actually. Humans are bigger than 87.6% of mammals on Earth. And the average Dutchman is the tallest of them all. So, there\u2019s no reason to ever feel small again, especially if you\u2019re from the Netherlands.\n\nFun Fact: The longest lifeform of all time isn\u2019t a plant or animal at all. It\u2019s a Honey Fungus and the biggest one goes on for 3.8 kilometers underneath a forest in Oregon.",

That\u2019s the trouble with growing tall. Gravity\u2019s pull is keeping us all down. But there are a few earthly giants that have fought gravity and won.\n\nThe key to growing tall is how you use your energy. That\u2019s why the tallest trees outrank any animal on Earth. Because trees spend all their energy on one thing- growing taller than their fellow neighbors. And there are two trees that are the best growers of them all- giant Redwoods and Mountain Ashes. Redwoods are renowned as the tallest life forms on Earth. But some experts think that Mountain Ashes could grow even taller if humans would stop cutting them down. In fact, the tallest Mountain Ash was just 1 meter shorter than the tallest Redwood.\n\nUnlike plants, animals spend energy on all sorts of tasks like eating, walking, and staying warm. So, they can't grow as tall. But it doesn't mean they're small, either. If you measured this African Elephant from shoulder to ground it would actually be taller than a Giraffe! But thanks to their long, strong necks, giraffes are the tallest animals alive.\n\nAnd if we look at animals throughout Earth\u2019s history, dinosaurs eclipse them all. These towering Sauropods were the biggest of the bunch. In fact, the top 10 list of tallest animals in history? All dinosaurs.\n\nBut, what if we looked at the longest lifeforms too? If you balance the longest Saltwater Crocodile on its nose, it would tie the Giraffe! And if we ignore legs, it gets even better! Tip to tail, the Green Anaconda nearly doubles the height of the tallest Giraffe on record.\n\nBut these land dwellers have nothing on animals of the deep. Supported by water, sea life can practically ignore gravity. Which means they can grow much larger. Take the Blue Whale for example. It\u2019s the most massive animal of all time. The entire cast of Broadway\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d can fit on its tongue! But it should be careful not to get tangled up in the tentacles of a Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish, which makes a Giant Squid look small by comparison. Now, the biggest fish alive is the Whale Shark. And if we look into the past, things get even bigger.\n\nAnd where do humans fit into all this? Somewhere near the top, actually. Humans are bigger than 87.6% of mammals on Earth. And the average Dutchman is the tallest of them all. So, there\u2019s no reason to ever feel small again, especially if you\u2019re from the Netherlands.\n\nFun Fact: The longest lifeform of all time isn\u2019t a plant or animal at all. It\u2019s a Honey Fungus and the biggest one goes on for 3.8 kilometers underneath a forest in Oregon."

Today, a speaker from New England might say \"Were you gonna plagiarize the whole thing for us? You have any thoughts of your own on this matter? Is that your thing; you come into a bar and read some obscure passage and pretend...you pawn it off as your own?\"\n\nNEW YORK\n\nFor such a geographically small area, New York City certainly has a bunch of distinctive accents. But in general, its accents evolved from a mixture of its Dutch and English roots and numerous waves of immigration.\n\nA modern speaker from New York probably won\u2019t sound like what you hear in movies like \"Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking here!\"\n\nThey\u2019re more likely to say \"Deep dish pizza is not not only better than New York pizza, it's not pizza.\"\n\nDELAWARE RIVER VALLEY\n\nNew York\u2019s New Jersian and Pennsylvanian neighbors sounded quite different.\n\nNowadays, someone from Philly might say \"We're a regular family. We watch Philly jawn on TV. We go down to the Jersey Shore. But when we want great hoagies, discount prices on beer, and a great atmosphere we go to Lee's Hoagies in Horsham, PA.\"\n\nSOUTHERN COAST\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what went on down south.\n\nThe southern coast of the United States has a variety of different accents. One example is Southern coastal white. \"What concerns me about the American press is this endless...endless attempt to label the guy some kind of kook.\"\n\nAFRICAN AMERICAN\n\nOther southern dialects preserved some of the original remnants to this day. \"They come over here and get oysters and clam and go fishing because they're right down the road. They're right in Brunswick or Savannah or Jacksonville.\n\nMuch later, a wave of African Americans migrated from the American South to urban centers in the North, mixing their accents together. \"Being a kid from New York City, I mean from Brooklyn. And my aunt \u2014 God bless her soul \u2014 she used to always take me to The Rockettes \u2014 you know, the Easter show and the Christmas show.\"\n\nAPPALACHIANS\n\nhe Ulster-Scots had a significant influence on many American dialects in the South and West. Most of the original accent has disappeared, and today, an American from Tennessee might sound like this. \"Now, I am just who I am. I'm not always nice. I choose to be good. I choose to have a good attitude because I want people to know. I am a girl with many colors.\"\n\nMIDWEST\n\nAs the Appalachian settlers headed west, their accents joined with speech patterns from the North.\n\nThe Midwest has many diverse accents. Today, a speaker from the Great Lakes might say \"I was born in the middle of the century in the middle of the country; a classic baby boomer.\"\n\nOr more famously, \"We got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses.\"\n\nWhile another from Wisconsin/Minnesota/the Dakotas might say \"If either of these men draw, I'm gonna be forced to shoot some people, and I don't want to do that.\"\n\nTEXAS\n\nDown in Texas, a very distinct accent developed. The famous Texan accent we know from movies like \"They shot and killed a state senator named Bibs in Waco, Texas.\" has started to level out. Visitors to big cities like Houston might be surprised to hear something more like \"Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nLast but not least is the West Coast, which had a very different mix of immigrants compared to the East Coast. California\u00a0doesn\u2019t come close to having one, distinct accent. A modern-day speaker might sound like \"We woke up the next morning on his actual birthday. And I told him I wanted to take him somewhere to lunch for his birthday.\" or \"What's so powerful about this novel is everyone has their own interpretation to these characters.\"\n\nThese are just a handful of American accents...and they\u2019re still evolving as we speak. We\u2019ll have to check back in a century or so from now to see what happens next.",

You can hold it... but should you?\n\nPeeing is pretty important. Your kidneys filter excess water and waste out of your blood and that urine needs somewhere to go: your bladder. Normally, it\u2019ll hold 1-2 cups comfortably. But if you make a habit of holding your pee for long periods of time, you can actually stretch your bladder to easily hold even more.\n\nCase in point, one study found that nurses who often held it in all day due to job constraints had nearly double the normal bladder capacity! And they were totally fine.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean you should hold it in if you can help it. Because your bladder may not be the only thing to stretch.\n\nYou may also stretch your external sphincter muscles. Those are important muscles connected to the outside of your bladder that are the gate-keepers of your golden liquid. Clench them and you hold in the gold. Relax them and you release the flood! But if you overstretch them, you can actually lose control. This is rare, and usually takes decades of holding it too long to reach that point, but once you do, it can lead to some awkward or even dangerous situations.\n\nFor example, with less overall control, you risk leaking urine when your bladder is full and not emptying it all the way when you finally do go. Not only can this increase your need to urinate more often since your bladder fills up quicker, it can also lead to a serious disorder called urinary retention, where you end up with too much urine in your bladder for too long. And since your bladder is basically a warm, wet bag of body waste, it\u2019s the PERFECT breeding ground for harmful bacteria that\u2019ll cause all sorts of damage.\n\nEven worse, if you\u2019re really unlucky and retain too much urine, it may back up into your kidneys. Which could lead to kidney failure, and ultimately death.\n\nThe good news is that you\u2019re more likely to just lose control of your muscles and pee waaaay before your bladder hits that point. But why not just reduce the risk all together and go to the bathroom?\n\nOk, ok, we get it. That movie is absolutely gripping. Luckily... You\u2019ll be fine if you only hold it in for a short time, every once in a while. So go ahead, hang in there... just don\u2019t make a habit of it.",

They have the ability to increase levels of oxytocin in the brain, bringing you a state of calm. \n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is the transcript of the video:\n\nNarrator: Puppies, they're the furry friends we take for granted. But, how does having one affect us?\u00a0\n\nMeg Olmert: My name is Meg Olmert and I'm the author of \"Made For Each Other: the biology of the human-animal bond.\" Our journey with dogs began about 45,000 years ago according to the latest archeological evidence. It preceded many hundreds of thousands of years with a more casual, and perhaps distant, pragmatic relationship with wolves as well.\n\nBut about 45,000 years ago we start to see the bones change and indications that A, dogs are certainly living with us. And that living with us appears to have had certain effects on their biology and their physiology. That is what enabled them to become our best friends.\n\nNarrator: How does this relationship work?\n\nOlmert: There is a feedback system that both neurochemically and psychologically and behaviorally that sets up between you and your pet. And how good you are to your pet is often exactly reflected back. Although, what I would say is they tend to be wildly generous. More generous than we are.\n\nSo, that is why, you know, they'll be wagging their tail, you know, thrilled to see you when you come home or if it's a cat it's purring. And you may be very distracted but they aren't. You are the greatest thing they ever saw if you've developed this relationship. If you've earned it.\n\nYou have a different relationship with your own pet versus your, even your neighbor's pet, because it's, that's your closer family. It's a different kind of bond and when they do fMRI studies just like a mother will have certain brain regions light up very strongly in the dopamine and oxytocin rich areas when they look at a picture of their baby versus just another infant. When you look at a picture of your dog versus another dog, you see the same thing. If you love dogs you're gonna get this reward to a degree whether you are looking at your dog or not.\n\nDo therapy dogs work? Well they certainly can. Dogs can do amazing things. With our program Warrior Canine Connection we work with service members and veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. We have the patients who say, \"This dog is better than any drug I ever took. I didn't sleep for five years until this dog slept next to me.\"\n\nNarrator: What happens to your body when you're with your dog?\n\nOlmert: Your heart rate comes down, your blood pressure comes down, your heart rate variability which is the ability of the heart to duck and dive and respond to stress improves. You release oxytocin, the opioids, adrenaline, and serotonin. So, all of these great reward chemicals and anti-stress chemicals can be released in both you and the pet.\n\nNarrator: What is oxytocin?\u00a0\n\nOlmert: Oxytocin is a very ancient chemical. It's in all social mammals. There's variations on it that you find in birds and in turtles, and in worms. And it most effectively is known for releasing breast milk and creating labor contractions. That's what it was first known for. So in a sense, it is the quintessential mammalian hormone since live birth and production of breast milk identifies us as mammals and mammary glands, et cetera.\n\nAbout 25 years ago they discovered that besides the oxytocin receptors and cells in the body that are producing oxytocin in the breast and the uterus, lo and behold, it's produced throughout the brain and in all the areas that control behavior and emotion.\n\nSo what was it doing there? And what they discovered was that it was talking to other classic brain neurotransmitters such as serotonin, and dopamine and adrenaline, and the opioid system. And it was setting up, by doing that, this perfect mental physiologic state of calm. It is the most powerful drive and it creates the bond that lasts a lifetime. That's how strong it is.",

What would happen if we happened to stare directly at the sun?\u00a0\n\nTech Insider tells you all you need to know about tech: gadgets, how-to's, gaming, science, digital culture, and more. \nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\nTI on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTI on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/\nTI on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is the transcript of the video:\n\nWhether it\u2019s to map the stars, spy on other planets, or study the sun,\u00a0humans have been looking to the skies for millennia.\u00a0But some objects are safer to observe than others.\u00a0\n\nFor example, astronomer Mark Thompson put a pig\u2019s eye behind a regular telescope aimed at the sun and it burned a hole straight through the lens in about 20 seconds.\n\nNow, looking at the sun through a telescope is an especially terrible idea but just how bad is it to glance up with the naked eye?\n\nOn a clear day, the sun shines up to 5,000 times brighter than an average light bulb.\u00a0When something that bright strikes your eye, a few things can happen.\n\nIf it\u2019s only for a moment, the worst you\u2019ll experience is a blurry splotch on your vision called an after image.\u00a0\n\nNormally, light reaches the retina at the back of your eye, where it triggers photoreceptors that relay the information to your brain.\u00a0This is how you are able to see anything.\n\nBut bombard them with too much light at once, and you can actually damage the cells and proteins that help them process light.\u00a0Since your retina has no pain receptors, the damage won\u2019t hurt, but it will leave that blurry splotch on your vision.\n\nUsually, it clears up in a few minutes\u00a0that is, unless you keep staring.\n\nNow, you\u2019re doing more than just overloading your retina.\u00a0For starters, you\u2019re giving your eyes an abnormally high dose of UV radiation the same stuff that causes sunburns.\u00a0Like your skin, the cornea at the front of your eye can also burn. And that will hurt.\n\nThe cornea protects the rest of your eye and is therefore covered in pain receptors that alert you whenever a pesky eyelash is on the loose.\u00a0\n\nBut UV radiation isn\u2019t the only issue.\u00a0Too much visible light can penetrate your eye and damage the retinal tissue, which causes a condition called solar retinitis.\u00a0This means parts of your retina can no longer process light normally, so you can end up with entire chunks of your vision blurred out.\n\nDepending on the extent of the damage, recovery can take weeks, months, and in severe cases over a year. But in rare cases, the damage is so extreme it never heals, leading to a rare condition called solar retinopathy.\u00a0This usually only shows up in reckless eclipse gazers.\n\nTurns out, during a solar eclipse, most of the sun\u2019s light is blocked, which actually can trick your brain into thinking it\u2019s safe to stare.\n\nNormally, our bodies have a built-in defense mechanism against staring at the sun.\u00a0Specifically, when we squint we look up, which minimizes the amount of light coming in and protects our cornea and retina.\n\nBut during a solar eclipse, the sun doesn\u2019t appear bright enough to trigger our defense mechanisms\u00a0so we can end up staring for longer than is safe.\n\nSuffice it to say, there\u2019s nothing good about staring at the sun.\u00a0So do your eyes a favor and avoid looking at it.\n\nAfter all, there are around 6,000 stars in the night sky you can safely observe for as long as you wish.",

Most of the time, they fill their cheeks with food, but sometimes mother hamsters store their babies in their cheeks for protection. Hamster cheeks contain pouches that resemble small deflated balloons. As food enters, the pouch expands and retractor muscles squeeze the pouch and pull food back.\u00a0\n\nSee more from April's Animals: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgTpLnSqzJntGjHLfuE2WNA\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is the transcript of the video:\n\nHow is it doing that?!! Hamsters, like Soda Pop, can stuff up to 20% of their body weight into their cheeks. For comparison, that\u2019s like the average person carrying around 30 extra pounds of food\u2014or about 120 quarter pounders. It would be a cool party trick, but not very comfortable\u2026or, let\u2019s face it, even possible.\n\nThat\u2019s where hamsters are different. But they don\u2019t stuff their faces for parties \u2026 or even because they\u2019re hungry. They do it to survive.\n\nIn the wild\u2014yes, there are actually wild hamsters\u2014they eat all kinds of food\u2014leaves, shoots, veggies, and fruit. What they don\u2019t consume right away, they store in those cheeks, which have pouches that extend halfway down their body and expand like a balloon. Thank goodness we don\u2019t have anything like that because it would probably look a little strange.\n\nBut hamsters NEED to stuff their faces, no matter how goofy it might look. In fact, they have to eat around every 2 hours to function normally. But foraging for food this frequently would make them easy prey. Instead, they collect food at night, and what they don\u2019t store they snack on along the way.\n\nSo during the day they can hide from predators and munch on their hoard in safety. And, thanks to the pouches in their cheeks that stockpile can get enormous. Hamster burrows have been found with nearly 200 lbs of stored food!\n\nThese cheeks also come with special retractor muscles that help the hamster stuff itself to maximum capacity. If you ever watch this in action you may notice that it reorients the food after plopping it in its mouth. What it\u2019s actually doing is angling the food so it easily slips to the back of the pouch as more comes in. Once the food is well on its way\u2014that\u2019s when the retractor muscles come into play. When the pouch stretches, the muscles contract which pushes the food toward the back, preventing it from clogging up. Pretty impressive stuff!\n\nBut that\u2019s not as impressive as some of the other things hamsters can do with their cheeks. For starters, some species will hide their babies inside these pouches to keep them safe. And there are reports that others can inflate their pouches with air and use it as a flotation device for swimming! But DON\u2019T try this at home. Only certain wild species do this, and we don\u2019t want you to drown your poor hamster. We\u2019d rather have you sit and enjoy the incredible cuteness of Soda Pop.\n\nFun fact: Hamsters can run over 5 miles in a 24 hour period.",

                    "description": "Hamsters can stuff their cheeks with up to 20% of their body weight. Most of the time, they fill their cheeks with food, but sometimes mother hamsters store their babies in their cheeks for protection. Hamster cheeks contain pouches that resemble small deflated balloons. As food enters, the pouch expands and retractor muscles squeeze the pouch and pull food back.\u00a0\n\nSee more from April's Animals: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgTpLnSqzJntGjHLfuE2WNA\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is the transcript of the video:\n\nHow is it doing that?!! Hamsters, like Soda Pop, can stuff up to 20% of their body weight into their cheeks. For comparison, that\u2019s like the average person carrying around 30 extra pounds of food\u2014or about 120 quarter pounders. It would be a cool party trick, but not very comfortable\u2026or, let\u2019s face it, even possible.\n\nThat\u2019s where hamsters are different. But they don\u2019t stuff their faces for parties \u2026 or even because they\u2019re hungry. They do it to survive.\n\nIn the wild\u2014yes, there are actually wild hamsters\u2014they eat all kinds of food\u2014leaves, shoots, veggies, and fruit. What they don\u2019t consume right away, they store in those cheeks, which have pouches that extend halfway down their body and expand like a balloon. Thank goodness we don\u2019t have anything like that because it would probably look a little strange.\n\nBut hamsters NEED to stuff their faces, no matter how goofy it might look. In fact, they have to eat around every 2 hours to function normally. But foraging for food this frequently would make them easy prey. Instead, they collect food at night, and what they don\u2019t store they snack on along the way.\n\nSo during the day they can hide from predators and munch on their hoard in safety. And, thanks to the pouches in their cheeks that stockpile can get enormous. Hamster burrows have been found with nearly 200 lbs of stored food!\n\nThese cheeks also come with special retractor muscles that help the hamster stuff itself to maximum capacity. If you ever watch this in action you may notice that it reorients the food after plopping it in its mouth. What it\u2019s actually doing is angling the food so it easily slips to the back of the pouch as more comes in. Once the food is well on its way\u2014that\u2019s when the retractor muscles come into play. When the pouch stretches, the muscles contract which pushes the food toward the back, preventing it from clogging up. Pretty impressive stuff!\n\nBut that\u2019s not as impressive as some of the other things hamsters can do with their cheeks. For starters, some species will hide their babies inside these pouches to keep them safe. And there are reports that others can inflate their pouches with air and use it as a flotation device for swimming! But DON\u2019T try this at home. Only certain wild species do this, and we don\u2019t want you to drown your poor hamster. We\u2019d rather have you sit and enjoy the incredible cuteness of Soda Pop.\n\nFun fact: Hamsters can run over 5 miles in a 24 hour period."

                "description": "Cockroaches are one of the most widespread and resilient creatures on this planet. They are practically everywhere around us, hiding in the walls, sewers, and perhaps your cupboard. They are also one of the most hated creatures by humans. If you are like most people, you will become determined to kill all of the roaches when you see them in your house. Despite such hatred towards them, how do cockroaches manage to thrive all around the globe?\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is the transcript of the video:\n\nYou might not want to think about this but over 3,500 species of cockroaches live on this planet.\n\nThe good news? Only about 30 of those species have adapted to live around humans.\n\nThe bad news? 30 species of cockroaches can live around us!\n\nRoaches are one of the most common pests in the US. So, it's no surprise that humans are always trying to kill them. But no matter how many times we stomp them, squash them, and bomb them with toxic chemicals, these pesky pests always seem to pop up time and time again. So what's going on?\n\nLet's take a closer look at the roach you probably know better than you'd like: Periplaneta Americana. AKA: the American Cockroach.\n\nBut this name is misleading. This guy is actually from Africa, not America. It made its way to the US by infesting boats in the 16th century. And has been spreading to almost every corner in the world ever since.\n\nTurns out, it's one of the largest species of cockroach around. But that's not the only big thing about it. New research has revealed that it has a massive genome \u2014 one of the largest of any studied insect!\n\nAnd many of these genes are exactly what make this roach a master survivor. Let's start with its genes associated with something called chemoreception. That's how roaches smell and taste their environment.\n\nTurns out, they're actually way better at sniffing out and eating food than most other insects. The American roach has 154 olfactory receptors for smell and 544 gustatory receptors for taste \u2014 more than any other insect on the planet!\n\nAs a result, these cockroaches are not picky eaters. Sure, they like cheese, meat, and sugar like the rest of us.

                    "description": "Cockroaches are one of the most widespread and resilient creatures on this planet. They are practically everywhere around us, hiding in the walls, sewers, and perhaps your cupboard. They are also one of the most hated creatures by humans. If you are like most people, you will become determined to kill all of the roaches when you see them in your house. Despite such hatred towards them, how do cockroaches manage to thrive all around the globe?\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/science\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderScience/\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_insider/\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing is the transcript of the video:\n\nYou might not want to think about this but over 3,500 species of cockroaches live on this planet.\n\nThe good news? Only about 30 of those species have adapted to live around humans.\n\nThe bad news? 30 species of cockroaches can live around us!\n\nRoaches are one of the most common pests in the US. So, it's no surprise that humans are always trying to kill them. But no matter how many times we stomp them, squash them, and bomb them with toxic chemicals, these pesky pests always seem to pop up time and time again. So what's going on?\n\nLet's take a closer look at the roach you probably know better than you'd like: Periplaneta Americana. AKA: the American Cockroach.\n\nBut this name is misleading. This guy is actually from Africa, not America. It made its way to the US by infesting boats in the 16th century. And has been spreading to almost every corner in the world ever since.\n\nTurns out, it's one of the largest species of cockroach around. But that's not the only big thing about it. New research has revealed that it has a massive genome \u2014 one of the largest of any studied insect!\n\nAnd many of these genes are exactly what make this roach a master survivor. Let's start with its genes associated with something called chemoreception. That's how roaches smell and taste their environment.\n\nTurns out, they're actually way better at sniffing out and eating food than most other insects. The American roach has 154 olfactory receptors for smell and 544 gustatory receptors for taste \u2014 more than any other insect on the planet!\n\nAs a result, these cockroaches are not picky eaters. Sure, they like cheese, meat, and sugar like the rest of us. But they'll also go for things like cardboard, book bindings, human toenails, rotting meat, blood, excrement, and even each other.\n\nThat's right, these roaches have been known to eat other dead or crippled cockroaches \u2014 all in the name of survival. It sounds gross, but this diverse diet makes it easy to find a meal just about anywhere, even if it's poisonous to most animals.\n\nThis roach has a bunch of genes called cytochrome p450s, which help it withstand poisonous chemicals like peppermint.
