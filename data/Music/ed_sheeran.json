jeans\nGoes to the gym at least six times a week\nWears boat shoes with no socks on his feet\nAnd I heard he\u2019s on a new diet and watches what he eats\n\nHe\u2019s got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached\nOwns every single Ministry CD\nTribal tattoos and he don\u2019t know what it means\nBut I heard he makes you happy so that\u2019s fine by me\n\nBut still, I\u2019m just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I\u2019ll be creeping a little \nI\u2019ll be trying not to double tap, from way back, cause  I know that\u2019s where the trouble\u2019s at \nLet me remind of the days when you used to hold my hand\nAnd when we sipped champagne out of cider cans \nI guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn\u2019t superman, just a young boy trying to be loved \nSo let me give it to you \n\nI don\u2019t wanna  know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be\nYou wouldn\u2019t be calling me up trying to \nCause I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, we\u2019ll get there eventually\nI know you\u2019re missing all this kind of love \nBut I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nYour new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse\nEvery year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I\u2019m kind of jealous\nHe wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on \nHe makes a gun sign, says chune, bwoydem light up the room\nBut enough about him, girl let\u2019s talk about you \nYou were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading\nEating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating\nNow you\u2019re eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie & Kim\nIn the back of the club kissing a boy that ain\u2019t him\nOk you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone\nI just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know\nYou\u2019re still a young girl trying to be loved\nSo let me give it to you \n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be\nYou wouldn\u2019t be calling me up trying to\nCause I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, we\u2019ll get there eventually\nI know you\u2019re missing all this kind of love \nBut I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nBaby, I\u2019m not trying to ruin your week \nBut you act so differently \nWhen you\u2019re with him I know you\u2019re lonely\nPlease, remember you\u2019re still free, to make the choice and leave\nAnd don\u2019t call me up you need to show me\n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be\nYou wouldn\u2019t be calling me up trying to \nCause I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, we\u2019ll get there

jeans\nGoes to the gym at least six times a week\nWears boat shoes with no socks on his feet\nAnd I heard he\u2019s on a new diet and watches what he eats\n\nHe\u2019s got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached\nOwns every single Ministry CD\nTribal tattoos and he don\u2019t know what it means\nBut I heard he makes you happy so that\u2019s fine by me\n\nBut still, I\u2019m just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I\u2019ll be creeping a little \nI\u2019ll be trying not to double tap, from way back, cause  I know that\u2019s where the trouble\u2019s at \nLet me remind of the days when you used to hold my hand\nAnd when we sipped champagne out of cider cans \nI guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn\u2019t superman, just a young boy trying to be loved \nSo let me give it to you \n\nI don\u2019t wanna  know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be\nYou wouldn\u2019t be calling me up trying to \nCause I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, we\u2019ll get there eventually\nI know you\u2019re missing all this kind of love \nBut I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nYour new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse\nEvery year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I\u2019m kind of jealous\nHe wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on \nHe makes a gun sign, says chune, bwoydem light up the room\nBut enough about him, girl let\u2019s talk about you \nYou were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading\nEating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating\nNow you\u2019re eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie & Kim\nIn the back of the club kissing a boy that ain\u2019t him\nOk you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone\nI just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know\nYou\u2019re still a young girl trying to be loved\nSo let me give it to you \n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be\nYou wouldn\u2019t be calling me up trying to\nCause I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, we\u2019ll get there eventually\nI know you\u2019re missing all this kind of love \nBut I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nBaby, I\u2019m not trying to ruin your week \nBut you act so differently \nWhen you\u2019re with him I know you\u2019re lonely\nPlease, remember you\u2019re still free, to make the choice and leave\nAnd don\u2019t call me up you need to show me\n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be\nYou wouldn\u2019t be calling me up trying to \nCause I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, we\u2019ll get there eventually\nI know you\u2019re missing all this kind of love \nBut I\u2019m positive that he don\u2019t wanna know about me\n\nKnow about me, know, know about me\nI don\u2019t wanna know about your new man, he don\u2019t wanna know\n\nAbout Ed Sheeran: \nEd Sheeran\u202fmay be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems

mind\nLearned to sing inside the lord\u2019s house\nBut stopped at the age of nine\nI forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy, when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the world\u2019s against me, is when I really come alive\nAnd every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\n\nYou know that I\u2019ve got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs \nI think life has got to the point, I know without it\u2019s no fun\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up \nInstead I look in the mirror, questioning what I\u2019ve become\nGuess it\u2019s a stereotypical day, for someone like me\nWithout a nine to five job or a uni degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nShow me the locked doors I\u2019ll find another use for the key, and you\u2019ll see \n\nI\u2019m well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me \nBut with that said give me one more \nI am another one to take the sting away \nI am happy on my own so here I\u2019ll stay\nSave your loving arms for a rainy day\nAnd I\u2019ll find comfort in my pain eraser\n\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\nI chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the route of all evil, and fame is hell\nRelationships and hearts you fix, they break as well\nAnd ain\u2019t nobody want to see you down in the dumps\nBecause you\u2019re living your dream and this should be fun\nPlease know that I\u2019m not trying to preach like I\u2019m reverend run\nI beg you don\u2019t be disappointed with the man I\u2019ve become\n\nConversations with my father on the A14\nAge 12, telling me I\u2019ve gotta chase those dreams\nNow I\u2019m playing for the people dad and they know me\nWith my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans\nWembley stadium crowds, two hundred and forty thou\nI may have grown up but I hope that Damian\u2019s proud \nAnd to the next generation, inspiration\u2019s allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now, somehow\n\nI\u2019m well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me \nBut with that said give me one more \nI am, another one to take the sting away \nOh I am happy on my own so here I\u2019ll stay\nWell save your loving arms for a rainy day\nAnd I\u2019ll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I\u2019ll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I\u2019ll find comfort in my pain eraser\n\nWelcome to the new show\nI guess you know I\u2019ve been away\nWhere I'm heading who knows\nMy heart will stay the same\n\nWelcome to the new show\nI guess you know I\u2019ve been away\nWhere I'm heading who knows\nMy pain eraser\nAnd I\u2019ll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I\u2019ll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I\u2019ll find comfort in my
