Make sure your shoulder, hip and ankles are in a straight line. \n\n3. Raise your left arm so that your hand is directly above your head. At the same time, raise your left leg so it's about 2 feet above your right foot. \n\n4. Hold plank for 15 seconds and then switch sides. \n\nSign up for our newsletter: http://goo.gl/ZCKdn\n\nStay tuned to our channel for more episodes: http://goo.gl/c6p4j\n\n1.
