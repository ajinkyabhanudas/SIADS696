In an industry chock full of gimmicks, unhealthy fads, questionable motivational tactics, and doctored images, we felt that people needed, and deserved, better. \n\nOver the last 11 years, we have published over 600 (and counting) free workout videos, as well as hundreds of recipes and healthy living articles, and built a free, custom website full of robust features and functionality. \n\nBoth of us feel as passionate about Fitness Blender today as we did on day 1, and neither of us are going anywhere. We have plans to continue designing and filming new workouts and writing new content - both free and for FB Plus. Our ethos and goals with Fitness Blender are the same now as they were when we started\u2014to make quality, unbiased health and fitness information as accessible as possible. For many years, it was just the two of us at Fitness Blender, but over the past few years we have grown our team (mostly behind-the-scenes), so that we can offer more. The growth of our team is key to our sustainability and ability to continue to do what we love, as well as our capacity to offer even more workout videos, health and fitness content, and website features.

In an industry chock full of gimmicks, unhealthy fads, questionable motivational tactics, and doctored images, we felt that people needed, and deserved, better. \n\nOver the last 11 years, we have published over 600 (and counting) free workout videos, as well as hundreds of recipes and healthy living articles, and built a free, custom website full of robust features and functionality. \n\nBoth of us feel as passionate about Fitness Blender today as we did on day 1, and neither of us are going anywhere. We have plans to continue designing and filming new workouts and writing new content - both free and for FB Plus. Our ethos and goals with Fitness Blender are the same now as they were when we started\u2014to make quality, unbiased health and fitness information as accessible as possible. For many years, it was just the two of us at Fitness Blender, but over the past few years we have grown our team (mostly behind-the-scenes), so that we can offer more. The growth of our team is key to our sustainability and ability to continue to do what we love, as well as our capacity to offer even more workout videos, health and fitness content, and website features.

                "description": "NEW FB Plus Features @ https://gofb.info/twH5bG A few weeks ago we launched analytics for all of the activity you track on your online Fitness Blender workout calendar, including the difficulty of your workouts, time spent in each training type, and how much time you're spending working each muscle group. \n\nWith this new feature, FB Plus users can now add custom workouts or independent workout videos to their online workout calendars, which will then be reflected in those same workout statistics. So whether it's a walk, swim, basketball game, snowboarding - you name it, you'll be able to add it. It also works for other trainers videos you enjoy; you'll be able to add their online workout videos to your FB workout calendar and once you complete those workouts, you'll see that information reflected in your stats as well.\n\nThe best part? FB Plus is still a baby! We're just getting started - and in early 2020 we'll start the release of exclusive content. So far FB Plus offers an entirely ads free experience, our \"Surprise Me\" feature for choosing a workout, and full workouts statistics that offer a breakdown of how often you're working each muscle group, a snapshot of the difficulty of your workouts and what kinds of training types you're using when you're working out. This newest feature of being able to add any kind of independent workout to your calendar and statistics is just the latest of a long line of new features coming to FB Plus in 2020. \n\nAlso, last week we just filmed our very first ever exclusive FB Plus workout video. It's a lower body HIIT and strength routine, and it's so much fun. We recorded it together so that people will have the option of high impact/advanced and low impact/beginner or intermediate, in one workout video. That new video will be available only on FB Plus in (very) early 2020. We also launched a free, 50 minute really-fun-but-brutal lower body workout yesterday, be sure to check it out @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibZDP3VYDo&t=818s\n\nIf you're curious, now is a great time to check it out; FB Plus is being offered at a discount now through January 31 2020.\n\n2020 is going to be a fun year!\n\nKelli & Daniel\n\nAt-home Workout Programs @ https://gofb.info/Programs \nExclusive workout videos, Workout Challenges, and site features @ https://gofb.info/FBPlus \n\n2 Week Workout Challenges @ https://gofb.info/PlusChallenges \nAdvanced search tool for over 600+ free workout videos @ https://gofb.info/WorkoutVideos \nThe most supportive fitness Community on the web @ https://gofb.info/FBCommunity \nMeal Plans written by Registered Dietitians @ https://gofb.info/FBMealPlans \nHealthy Living articles and recipes @ https://gofb.info/HealthyLiving\n\nFitness Blender Gift Cards @ https://gofb.info/GiftCards \nWe use PowerBlock adjustable dumbbells @ https://gofb.info/PowerBlock\n\nFitness Blender\u2019s Workout Programs and subscription platform, FB Plus, make it possible to keep our individual workout videos and website free.

Stay in the loop in the FB Community @ https://gofb.info/nQZWx0\n\nAbout our new clothing line, Workout Complete\nFor nearly a decade now, the words \"Workout Complete\" have held great meaning to us and millions of other people around the world. It's the feeling of calm accomplishment that you get when you challenge yourself physically after finishing a workout. It's about feeling good, moving smart, and showing up for yourself in a way that improves your health. For many of us, these two words can even be enough to motivate starting into the actual workout in the first place.\n\nWorkout Complete is Fitness Blender\u2019s new apparel line. We spent four years searching for the perfect fabric, fit, functionality, and feel. We went through hundreds of samples and years of back and forth until we were satisfied with the final product. These pieces have been put to the test, and fittingly, have already seen many Workout Completes.\n\nLike our workouts, we wanted the clothing to be as inclusive as possible. We are excited to be able to offer sizes X-Small to XXL. This was important to us.\n\nAll of the materials are made in the US, as is the manufacturing of the entire apparel line. The Fitness Blender Community is worldwide and we are very proud of that. Because this is our very first release of this line, there are a handful of countries that we cannot ship to at this point. Only about half of our audience is in the US, so ultimately our goal will be to become more and more accessible as we grow and build Workout Complete.\n\nJust like with Fitness Blender, a lot of heart has gone into this. Also similar to Fitness Blender is the focus on quality and functionality and the desire to constantly improve our product and what we're able to offer.\n\nWe're grateful for every one of you who have patiently waited years for the reveal of Workout Complete, and who are as excited about this new adventure as we are.\n\nSincerely, \nKelli and Daniel",

                "description": "New: 4 Week Core Program for Abs, Obliques & Lower Back Now Available @ https://gofb.info/xsfEqx\n\nPlease note: This is NOT your typical abs program and this plan is not just a bunch of repetitions of core exercises! We built this program for real results, and the combination of core, HIIT cardio, and strength training is not only great for building a lean, toned stomach or six pack, it\u2019s also effective for allover toning, reducing body fat, improving cardiovascular endurance, increasing lean muscle mass, functional strength, agility, coordination, flexibility and balance. With these workouts and a healthy diet, you can definitely see drops in body fat and scale weight.\n\nA heavy emphasis on the abs, obliques and lower back, combined with HIIT and total body strength training, helps lower body fat, flatten, tone and define the midsection. The carefully constructed day by day plan uses our free full length workout videos to weave total body strength and toning routines and varying intensities of body fat reducing cardio in with a blend of dynamic abdominal exercises to not only tone up those muscles that are residing underneath any excess body fat, but also to burn off the fat layer they're hiding under so that you can see the product of all of your hard work. This program also aims to build a stronger core which will benefit you, your fitness goals, & your quality of life in ways far beyond the superficial goal of a flatter stomach.\n\nWorkouts are scheduled five days a week (three weekly core intensive workouts, roughly every other day), and average out to 31 minutes a day. Dumbbells are used throughout the program & are recommended but not absolutely necessary & you can always improvise.  As an added bonus, your core is not the only muscle group that's being targeted; with the very dynamic exercises found in these workouts, you are likely to see rapid changes in your belly fat and tone, as well as in the rest of your body. Make sure to take \"before and after\" photos so that you can see the difference in 4 weeks!\n\nAt-home Workout Programs @ https://gofb.info/Programs \nExclusive workout videos, Workout Challenges, and site features @ https://gofb.info/FBPlus \n\n2 Week Workout Challenges @ https://gofb.info/PlusChallenges \nAdvanced search tool for over 600+ free workout videos @ https://gofb.info/WorkoutVideos \nThe most supportive fitness Community on the web @ https://gofb.info/FBCommunity \nMeal Plans written by Registered Dietitians @ https://gofb.info/FBMealPlans \nHealthy Living articles and recipes @ https://gofb.info/HealthyLiving\n\nFitness Blender Gift Cards @ https://gofb.info/GiftCards \nWe use PowerBlock adjustable dumbbells @ https://gofb.info/PowerBlock\n\nFitness Blender\u2019s Workout Programs and subscription platform, FB Plus, make it possible to keep our individual workout videos and website free.

This 4 week plan uses 3 intense workouts a week to reshape your lower body and bring about quick changes to your overall fitness level. Strength training and HIIT are the main training styles in this program, though Pilates, Barre, yoga, stretching, and plyometrics all make appearances.\n\nWorkouts are scheduled three days a week (roughly every other day), and average out to 38 minutes a day. Dumbbells are recommended but not absolutely necessary. As an added bonus, the core (abs, obliques & lower back) is heavily engaged throughout the very dynamic exercises found in these workouts, so you will likely find that you\u2019re seeing rapid changes in your belly fat and the tone of your midsection, as well as in your lower body. Make sure to take \"before and after\" photos so that you can see the difference in 4 weeks!\n\nAt-home Workout Programs @ https://gofb.info/Programs \nExclusive workout videos, Workout Challenges, and site features @ https://gofb.info/FBPlus \n\n2 Week Workout Challenges @ https://gofb.info/PlusChallenges \nAdvanced search tool for over 600+ free workout videos @ https://gofb.info/WorkoutVideos \nThe most supportive fitness Community on the web @ https://gofb.info/FBCommunity \nMeal Plans written by Registered Dietitians @ https://gofb.info/FBMealPlans \nHealthy Living articles and recipes @ https://gofb.info/HealthyLiving\n\nFitness Blender Gift Cards @ https://gofb.info/GiftCards \nWe use PowerBlock adjustable dumbbells @ https://gofb.info/PowerBlock\n\nFitness Blender\u2019s Workout Programs and subscription platform, FB Plus, make it possible to keep our individual workout videos and website free.
