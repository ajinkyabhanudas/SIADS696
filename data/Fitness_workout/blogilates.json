I am not saying Blogilates will be the cheapest of the cheap because I\u2019ll never sacrifice quality, but I\u2019ll try my hardest to find the best balance between design, quality, and price.\n\nOther \u2728new\u2728 things to look out for:\n\n\u2714\ufe0f affordable yoga mat\n\u2714\ufe0f affordable booty bands\n\u2714\ufe0f foldable yoga mat - great for travel\n\u2714\ufe0f improved gold weight rack\n\u2714\ufe0f slider discs\n\u2714\ufe0f gym flooring\n\nDid you see any of these at your store yet!? Tell me if the gym bag is at your store or not! I\u2019m so curious!\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey\n\nPs: Everything is available at target.com too in case you can\u2019t find it in store!\n@Target"

We hired throughout the pandemic and all learned how to work remotely, so we never got a chance to spend time together in person. I think we were all nervous (even intimated) to meet one another!\n\nBut for the next 3 days, we laughed so hard our cheeks hurt and until tears ran down our faces. I felt so comfortable. I felt so\u2026at home.\n\nI can\u2019t even properly express how full my heart feels right now. To finally be surrounded by the RIGHT people changes everything.\n\nJust 3 years ago, I broke. I really was going to drop all of it.  @POPFLEX By Blogilates. Blogilates. All of it. The businesses were too painful to run. The toxicity was poisoning my mind, my body, my team, and my business. I wanted to throw it all away and just move far far away from LA.\n\nI\u2019m lucky Sam told me to just give it one last chance because if he didn\u2019t say that, I really wouldn\u2019t be here right now. I was completely broken. But when he said \u201cjust 30 more days\u201d - I pulled together any last shreds of strength I had (which wasn\u2019t much) and went into pure survival mode.\n\nIn those final days, something magical happened.\n\nThe universe put the right people in my path and helped me clear out the negativity so they I could breathe again\u2026stand again\u2026lead again.\n\nMy heart is filled with so much gratitude right now for every member of my team: the people who helped me find myself again. \n\nI was so lost, but now I am sure of it, I\u2019m home.\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey",

We hired throughout the pandemic and all learned how to work remotely, so we never got a chance to spend time together in person. I think we were all nervous (even intimated) to meet one another!\n\nBut for the next 3 days, we laughed so hard our cheeks hurt and until tears ran down our faces. I felt so comfortable. I felt so\u2026at home.\n\nI can\u2019t even properly express how full my heart feels right now. To finally be surrounded by the RIGHT people changes everything.\n\nJust 3 years ago, I broke. I really was going to drop all of it.  @POPFLEX By Blogilates. Blogilates. All of it. The businesses were too painful to run. The toxicity was poisoning my mind, my body, my team, and my business. I wanted to throw it all away and just move far far away from LA.\n\nI\u2019m lucky Sam told me to just give it one last chance because if he didn\u2019t say that, I really wouldn\u2019t be here right now. I was completely broken. But when he said \u201cjust 30 more days\u201d - I pulled together any last shreds of strength I had (which wasn\u2019t much) and went into pure survival mode.\n\nIn those final days, something magical happened.\n\nThe universe put the right people in my path and helped me clear out the negativity so they I could breathe again\u2026stand again\u2026lead again.\n\nMy heart is filled with so much gratitude right now for every member of my team: the people who helped me find myself again. \n\nI was so lost, but now I am sure of it, I\u2019m home.\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey"

When I\u2019m running on the treadmill, it\u2019s no longer food shows I\u2019m watching - it\u2019s all historical non-fiction shows (I can\u2019t do the made up stuff)!\n\nI love learning the past because it tells me so much about the future. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to start off the video will a little history lesson on the invention of the first crewneck sweatshirt! It was invented by a football player named Benjamin Russell Jr. who also happens to be the son of THE founder of THE Russell Athletics brand! Benjamin created the initial crewneck sweater so he could wear something comfortable to football practice. How cool is it that 96 years later, the Russell brand is still strong and that design pretty much hasn\u2019t changed? A true legacy brand and a true classic garment.\n\nOn the flip side though\u202696 years and the crewneck sweater hasn\u2019t evolved to cater to women\u2019s bodies besides just being smaller and being pink!?? Time to take the challenge!\n\nI didn\u2019t want to stray toooooo far from the classic 1926 crewneck, because it\u2019s classic for a reason! It works! But does it excite me? No!! I wanted to update the crewneck sweater and give it a little bit more of a feminine flair. You know me and my romantic sleeves. So I did that \ud83d\ude42\n\nI hope you like the @POPFLEX By Blogilates \u2728Belle Sweater\u2728\n\nI love elevating basics because it\u2019s such a challenge to balance the basic with the fashion. You can\u2019t go too hard that it\u2019s no longer basic\u2026but you can\u2019t go too soft that nothing happened.\n\nAnyway tell me what you think!\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey\n\nPs: I\u2019m wearing small and this comes in XS - 3X in heather grey, black and sand! @POPFLEX By Blogilates at https://www.popflexactive.com",

                    "description": "Shop the Belle Sweater https://bit.ly/popflex-belle-sweater\n\nI don\u2019t know what it is, but over the past few years I\u2019ve become totally enthralled by history. When I\u2019m running on the treadmill, it\u2019s no longer food shows I\u2019m watching - it\u2019s all historical non-fiction shows (I can\u2019t do the made up stuff)!\n\nI love learning the past because it tells me so much about the future. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to start off the video will a little history lesson on the invention of the first crewneck sweatshirt! It was invented by a football player named Benjamin Russell Jr. who also happens to be the son of THE founder of THE Russell Athletics brand! Benjamin created the initial crewneck sweater so he could wear something comfortable to football practice. How cool is it that 96 years later, the Russell brand is still strong and that design pretty much hasn\u2019t changed? A true legacy brand and a true classic garment.\n\nOn the flip side though\u202696 years and the crewneck sweater hasn\u2019t evolved to cater to women\u2019s bodies besides just being smaller and being pink!?? Time to take the challenge!\n\nI didn\u2019t want to stray toooooo far from the classic 1926 crewneck, because it\u2019s classic for a reason! It works! But does it excite me? No!! I wanted to update the crewneck sweater and give it a little bit more of a feminine flair. You know me and my romantic sleeves. So I did that \ud83d\ude42\n\nI hope you like the @POPFLEX By Blogilates \u2728Belle Sweater\u2728\n\nI love elevating basics because it\u2019s such a challenge to balance the basic with the fashion. You can\u2019t go too hard that it\u2019s no longer basic\u2026but you can\u2019t go too soft that nothing happened.\n\nAnyway tell me what you think!\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey\n\nPs: I\u2019m wearing small and this comes in XS - 3X in heather grey, black and sand! @POPFLEX By Blogilates at https://www.popflexactive.com"

Oftentimes, I find my happiness after venturing into the hardest of decisions and the stickiest of messes. The best rewards often come with the biggest challenges.\n\nI can\u2019t believe where I am today, and I\u2019m not even close to where I want to be. And to be clear, I\u2019m not not motivated by a dollar amount or the number or the number of followers. Unlike other companies who\u2019s main goal is to sell or get investors, that\u2019s not mine. My goal is to build a legacy brand with the best products that will live on after I die. My goal? Impact. I want grow and impact as many women as I can, while I can. To me, that\u2019s the fun. That\u2019s my motivation. You can ask Sam - I never look at the numbers. I\u2019m purely excited by the creation process and then seeing you make my designs a part of your life. I LIVE for that. That is what fuels my 17 hour work days 7 days a week. Some may say I\u2019m unhealthily addicted to my job but I don\u2019t care what they say - what an absolute gift it is to be given the opportunity to have a career that aligns with my childhood dream, my passion and my mission. I feel lucky everyday.\n\nThis week I found out that @POPFLEX By Blogilates made the #INC5000 list \ud83d\ude33 We were named one of the fastest growing companies in North America. Apparently there are 33 million of them. \n\nAnd guess what? We\u2019re just a tiny team. Made up of mostly women and Sam \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to be surrounded with some of the kindest humans in the world: ideating, problem solving, and creating cool things every single day. From being days away from tossing out my brand and business a few years ago\u2026to now this? Like I said, the most amazing things come after the toughest challenges.\n\nI\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do though - especially finding peace with my parents. It\u2019s a difficult, emotional subject and there is a section of my heart that is still numb with pain. I\u2019ll figure it out one day.\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey",

                    "description": "When it comes to really difficult decisions, I cannot ignore my heart. What I\u2019ve learned is that my heart knows where I belong and what I\u2019m meant to do. Oftentimes, I find my happiness after venturing into the hardest of decisions and the stickiest of messes. The best rewards often come with the biggest challenges.\n\nI can\u2019t believe where I am today, and I\u2019m not even close to where I want to be. And to be clear, I\u2019m not not motivated by a dollar amount or the number or the number of followers. Unlike other companies who\u2019s main goal is to sell or get investors, that\u2019s not mine. My goal is to build a legacy brand with the best products that will live on after I die. My goal? Impact. I want grow and impact as many women as I can, while I can. To me, that\u2019s the fun. That\u2019s my motivation. You can ask Sam - I never look at the numbers. I\u2019m purely excited by the creation process and then seeing you make my designs a part of your life. I LIVE for that. That is what fuels my 17 hour work days 7 days a week. Some may say I\u2019m unhealthily addicted to my job but I don\u2019t care what they say - what an absolute gift it is to be given the opportunity to have a career that aligns with my childhood dream, my passion and my mission. I feel lucky everyday.\n\nThis week I found out that @POPFLEX By Blogilates made the #INC5000 list \ud83d\ude33 We were named one of the fastest growing companies in North America. Apparently there are 33 million of them. \n\nAnd guess what? We\u2019re just a tiny team. Made up of mostly women and Sam \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to be surrounded with some of the kindest humans in the world: ideating, problem solving, and creating cool things every single day. From being days away from tossing out my brand and business a few years ago\u2026to now this? Like I said, the most amazing things come after the toughest challenges.\n\nI\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do though - especially finding peace with my parents. It\u2019s a difficult, emotional subject and there is a section of my heart that is still numb with pain. I\u2019ll figure it out one day.\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey"

And the truth is - I struggle with this a lot. \n\nThis print is risky. You either love it or hate it. My personal style is very romantic and feminine, so I naturally lean into flower prints and light hues. But the reality is, and the sales data show that dark colors like black are the easiest to sell.\n\nThis time, I decided to test this new gym bag in a print that made my heart happy! I\u2019m obsessed with the crazy contrast between the peach florals and the neon lime! \n\nWhat do you think? Do you like the new @POPFLEX  Valentina Duffle in Neon Rose or would you prefer another color? Leave me a comment and I\u2019ll consider it if I decide to make this again!\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey \n\nPs: you can get this now on https://www.popflexactive.com",

                    "description": "Shop the Valentina Duffle https://bit.ly/shop-valentina-duffle\n\nFor me, one of the hardest things about designing products is making sure the design gets me excited but also, can actually sell. And the truth is - I struggle with this a lot. \n\nThis print is risky. You either love it or hate it. My personal style is very romantic and feminine, so I naturally lean into flower prints and light hues. But the reality is, and the sales data show that dark colors like black are the easiest to sell.\n\nThis time, I decided to test this new gym bag in a print that made my heart happy! I\u2019m obsessed with the crazy contrast between the peach florals and the neon lime! \n\nWhat do you think? Do you like the new @POPFLEX  Valentina Duffle in Neon Rose or would you prefer another color? Leave me a comment and I\u2019ll consider it if I decide to make this again!\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey \n\nPs: you can get this now on https://www.popflexactive.com"

Between all of the luscious guacamole and mesmerizing cenotes, there was us dodging swindlers and then getting swindled, and then almost dying in a minicar almost-accident - TWICE - just to name a few things \ud83d\ude05\n\nAnyway, it was a memorable trip for sure and my favorite part besides getting time to focus on Sam and our relationship as husband and wife (not business partners) was getting over my fear of equalizing my ears. \n\nOver 10 years ago I did an introductory dive in the Great Barrier Reef with my sister and the tour guide did not properly explain how to equalize our ears so they ended up popping SHARPLY \ud83d\udd2a and the pain was excruciating. Since then I\u2019ve avoided diving because I\u2019ve been terrified of that specific feeling. \n\nAnyway, on this trip, I asked our snorkeling guide if he could teach me how to do it and turns out, it\u2019s way easier than I thought. You just hold your nose and blow as you go down. That\u2019s it!!! The pressure relieves itself in a comforting way actually.\n\nFinally, I was able to dive deeper and omg it was so freeing to explore. I felt like a mermaid! \ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Next step, learn how to hold my breath longer.\n\nDid we truly relax and did it feel like a Minimoon? Well, we tried. \ud83d\ude43 But when you\u2019re running a business, you\u2019re never off and you know what, I choose this life and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. I love what I do and I don\u2019t need a vacation from it - I just need dedicated time to not forget that there\u2019s more to life than the biz and I need to experience as much of it as I can with Sam before we can\u2019t anymore.\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey\n\nPs: For those wondering, we were in Isla Mujeres and then Tulum (which was major vibes) and then Cozumel which is where all of this go pro footage is from. The tour we took was from a nice family biz named VIP Tours Cozumel .",

                    "description": "Sam and I went on a Minimoon for the past 10 days and it was truly an adventure - like, a little bit of the magical kind\u2026but more of the shocking kind than I would have liked. Between all of the luscious guacamole and mesmerizing cenotes, there was us dodging swindlers and then getting swindled, and then almost dying in a minicar almost-accident - TWICE - just to name a few things \ud83d\ude05\n\nAnyway, it was a memorable trip for sure and my favorite part besides getting time to focus on Sam and our relationship as husband and wife (not business partners) was getting over my fear of equalizing my ears. \n\nOver 10 years ago I did an introductory dive in the Great Barrier Reef with my sister and the tour guide did not properly explain how to equalize our ears so they ended up popping SHARPLY \ud83d\udd2a and the pain was excruciating. Since then I\u2019ve avoided diving because I\u2019ve been terrified of that specific feeling. \n\nAnyway, on this trip, I asked our snorkeling guide if he could teach me how to do it and turns out, it\u2019s way easier than I thought. You just hold your nose and blow as you go down. That\u2019s it!!! The pressure relieves itself in a comforting way actually.\n\nFinally, I was able to dive deeper and omg it was so freeing to explore. I felt like a mermaid! \ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Next step, learn how to hold my breath longer.\n\nDid we truly relax and did it feel like a Minimoon? Well, we tried. \ud83d\ude43 But when you\u2019re running a business, you\u2019re never off and you know what, I choose this life and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. I love what I do and I don\u2019t need a vacation from it - I just need dedicated time to not forget that there\u2019s more to life than the biz and I need to experience as much of it as I can with Sam before we can\u2019t anymore.\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey\n\nPs: For those wondering, we were in Isla Mujeres and then Tulum (which was major vibes) and then Cozumel which is where all of this go pro footage is from. The tour we took was from a nice family biz named VIP Tours Cozumel ."

I actually bought that white one you see in the video. Even though it\u2019s super cute, it HIGHLIGHTED my bloat \ud83c\udf88\n\nBy this time, you know how my life goes: \n\n1. Cassey encounters a problem \n2. Cassey is forced to solve the problem \n\nI actually really enjoy these design challenges though because, well, I\u2019m now coming to realize I just love challenges in general - fitness ones or fashion ones! \n\nMy answer to the perfect active dress? \n\nThe \u2728Twirl Dress\u2728for @POPFLEX \n\n\u2714\ufe0f Circle skirt for ULTIMATE twirlability\n\u2714\ufe0f Built-in shorts with POCKETS\n\u2714\ufe0f Waist snatching drawstring panel \n\u2714\ufe0f Built-in shelf bra with padding to give your girls a boost if you need it\n\u2714\ufe0f Literally the stretchiest and softest fabric: ButterSmooth \ud83e\uddc8 \n\nIt comes in XS to 3X! Which color is your fave?! What would you wear it for?!!\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey \n\nPs: I\u2019m wearing XS because it\u2019s super stretchy and I like my dresses and skorts micro short but on the size chart I\u2019m a small.

After my 90 day journey, I completely lost a sense of purpose, I lost all focus, wanted to rush through every workout or not even want to do them at all. My workouts didn\u2019t feel meaningful and worst of all, it wasn\u2019t fun anymore. \n\nAnyway, yesterday, I came up with an idea to switch things up and suddenly I felt that rush of excitement again!\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like working out, it\u2019s just that I was getting bored and needed a change. So here\u2019s the plan!\n\nI\u2019m doing the 30:300 Challenge.\n\n\ud83d\udd32 30 min cardio\n\ud83d\udd32 100 push-ups \n\ud83d\udd32 100 double leg lifts \n\ud83d\udd32 100 plie half deadlifts \n\nNote: I am breaking up the reps into sets and rotating through.\n\nI am feeling like I need to take a break from all the heavy lifting and go back to my roots - more Pilates and bodyweight exercises. I\u2019ll be doing this everyday for 30 days, and the reason why I wanted to go equipment free was because I wanted to be able to do this anywhere even when I\u2019d be traveling.\n\nI am EXTRA excited because Sam agreed to do part of the challenge with me. He committed to 30 min cardio and 100 push-ups everyday. So I guess he\u2019s doing the 30:100 \ud83d\ude04 We\u2019re both filling out a chart everyday and keeping each other accountable. The motivation is BACKKKK and I\u2019m so thrilled to feel that feeling again!\n\nAnyway, this challenge was made first soley for me to get my motivation and focus back. Join in if you want, or not! Either way I\u2019m on day 2 and feeling very sore. \n\nComment below if you\u2019re in! LETSSS GOOOOOOOO!!!\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey",

I like the smell and how smooth it feels going on because of the skin conditioners in the formula. Try it if you\u2019re looking for a new deo.\n\n\u2764\ufe0fCassey"

When you don\u2019t have to waste time matching your top to your shorts, getting naked on the toilet for a moment is no big deal \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nGuys I\u2019ve been wanting to make a workout romper for soooooooo long and I\u2019m beyond excited to share with you the \u2728Runsie\u2728 because it\u2019s so friendly to wear!! I say that because I know onesies can be intimidating - showing every curve and bump - so it may not be your fave choice on a bloated day. But this POPFLEX Runsie you guys - OMG -  the floofy run shorts are so comfy and totally bloat friendly while the snatch panel cinches you in!\n\nBest part is - if you need more support just pair it with the Refine Bra! I\u2019m a 32A and wear XS so I don\u2019t need a second layer for running or high impact workouts - but if you do, it totally matches! \n\nBtw - a note on sizing. This Runsie was designed in March 2021 and back then we were unsure if people would even like onesies. So we only made a limited range to experiment in our most popular sizes first.

When you don\u2019t have to waste time matching your top to your shorts, getting naked on the toilet for a moment is no big deal \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nGuys I\u2019ve been wanting to make a workout romper for soooooooo long and I\u2019m beyond excited to share with you the \u2728Runsie\u2728 because it\u2019s so friendly to wear!! I say that because I know onesies can be intimidating - showing every curve and bump - so it may not be your fave choice on a bloated day. But this POPFLEX Runsie you guys - OMG -  the floofy run shorts are so comfy and totally bloat friendly while the snatch panel cinches you in!\n\nBest part is - if you need more support just pair it with the Refine Bra! I\u2019m a 32A and wear XS so I don\u2019t need a second layer for running or high impact workouts - but if you do, it totally matches! \n\nBtw - a note on sizing. This Runsie was designed in March 2021 and back then we were unsure if people would even like onesies. So we only made a limited range to experiment in our most popular sizes first. As you know product development takes a year or more, so even though now I KNOW we need to increase our size range to match our bras and bottoms (XS-3X) - product dev has begun but it\u2019ll take a bit to appear on the website. The plus onesies will come but not for a while. I\u2019m hoping to have the fit locked in by 2023! Earlier if we\u2019re lucky! We\u2019re still fit-testing.

So yes, even though I\u2019ve been weight lifting for a few months, doing heavy squats and hip thrusts etc, because I had not been doing elevated plie squats - my body was like wait hold on.\n\nI\u2019m a huge believer of cross training. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll build your strongest, most flexible, most balanced body.\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey\n\nPs: Shortsie from @POPFLEX  socks I got for free when I bought a sweater from a brand I found on IG but forgot it\u2019s name at this point."

I\u2019m talking about public perception too.\n\nWhen my body became my billboard (as more eyes fell upon my YouTube channel), the narrative around it changed to match the story people wanted to tell.\n\nA short timeline:\n\n1. 2009: Started posting workout videos.\n\n2. Early 2010s: \u201cShe\u2019s too fat to be a trainer.\u201d\n\n3. Body positive movement.\n\n4. \u201cSo inspirational that someone with a body like hers can be a trainer.\u201d\n\n5. 2019: Went on my 90 day journey to get in the best shape of my life - mentally and physically.\n\n6. \u201cShe\u2019s a bad role model. A complete hypocrite. She\u2019s mentally disordered. A shame to all women!!!!\u201d\n\n7. Lost weight. Found myself.\n\n8. 2020\u2019s: \u201cShe\u2019s looks so weak and skinny.\u201d\n\nI want to be clear that over the past 12 years, way more positive has happened than negative, but as a human, and an emotional one, it\u2019s not easy to ignore what\u2019s being said about me. So unfortunately, it takes up space in my brain and this timeline shows those moments that impacted me in that way.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m always trying to work on not caring what people have to say because they don\u2019t know my story, my journey, or my body.

I\u2019m talking about public perception too.\n\nWhen my body became my billboard (as more eyes fell upon my YouTube channel), the narrative around it changed to match the story people wanted to tell.\n\nA short timeline:\n\n1. 2009: Started posting workout videos.\n\n2. Early 2010s: \u201cShe\u2019s too fat to be a trainer.\u201d\n\n3. Body positive movement.\n\n4. \u201cSo inspirational that someone with a body like hers can be a trainer.\u201d\n\n5. 2019: Went on my 90 day journey to get in the best shape of my life - mentally and physically.\n\n6. \u201cShe\u2019s a bad role model. A complete hypocrite. She\u2019s mentally disordered. A shame to all women!!!!\u201d\n\n7. Lost weight. Found myself.\n\n8. 2020\u2019s: \u201cShe\u2019s looks so weak and skinny.\u201d\n\nI want to be clear that over the past 12 years, way more positive has happened than negative, but as a human, and an emotional one, it\u2019s not easy to ignore what\u2019s being said about me. So unfortunately, it takes up space in my brain and this timeline shows those moments that impacted me in that way.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m always trying to work on not caring what people have to say because they don\u2019t know my story, my journey, or my body. They have no right to strip me of my happiness or invalidate my strength.\n\nSo yeah\u2026 what you see isn\u2019t always what you get\u2026 especially If you ain\u2019t seeing clearly.\n\n\u2764\ufe0fCassey"

But to give it that @POPFLEX  twist, it has to be cute\u2026or else it will NEVER EVER see the light of day!\n\nThanks for always leaving your comments - I read them, I write them down, and we talk about it in our product development meetings. \n\nI hope this onesie answers your wishes! Pockets and adjustable straps \ud83d\ude42\n\nI know some of you were asking for a more modest one with a closed back and longer sleeves. I\u2019ve been trying to figure it out but to be 100% honest, I\u2019m struggling! Once I come up with something I\u2019ll get it into the prototyping phase\u2026and then from there you probably won\u2019t see it for 9-12 months. The product dev lifecycle is long because I care about every aspect of the design and I care that when you put it on your body thst you\u2019re happy with the fit, that you \u2764\ufe0f how you look, that you \u2764\ufe0f how you FEEL, and that it PERFORMS! \n\nI am wearing the S in the Shortsie because they thighs grew so much from my 90 day journey and I\u2019m wearing the XS in the long onesie version. \n\nAnyway! Let me know your thoughts on the peekaboo onesie!\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey",

                    "description": "Get the Peekaboo Onesie: https://bit.ly/POPFLEXonesies\n\nProduct design, to me, is problem solving. But to give it that @POPFLEX  twist, it has to be cute\u2026or else it will NEVER EVER see the light of day!\n\nThanks for always leaving your comments - I read them, I write them down, and we talk about it in our product development meetings. \n\nI hope this onesie answers your wishes! Pockets and adjustable straps \ud83d\ude42\n\nI know some of you were asking for a more modest one with a closed back and longer sleeves. I\u2019ve been trying to figure it out but to be 100% honest, I\u2019m struggling! Once I come up with something I\u2019ll get it into the prototyping phase\u2026and then from there you probably won\u2019t see it for 9-12 months. The product dev lifecycle is long because I care about every aspect of the design and I care that when you put it on your body thst you\u2019re happy with the fit, that you \u2764\ufe0f how you look, that you \u2764\ufe0f how you FEEL, and that it PERFORMS! \n\nI am wearing the S in the Shortsie because they thighs grew so much from my 90 day journey and I\u2019m wearing the XS in the long onesie version. \n\nAnyway! Let me know your thoughts on the peekaboo onesie!\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey"

Honestly, I thought I was about 5-7 years away but, here we are, a little early.\n\nWhen I got the call from @How I Built This Podcasts (my fave podcast everrrr) I DIED. I was SCREAMING.\n\nI\u2019ve been listening to @Guy Raz and his soothing voice since the beginning of time, learning from some of the most inspiring entrepreneurs in the world! It has ALWAYS been a dream of mine to be on his podcast. My goal was to do something so impactful that Guy would find my story worthy enough of sharing amongst his other incredible leaders and innovators.\n\nMany of you know me from the free workout videos I\u2019ve uploaded to YouTube over the past 13 years. But what you don\u2019t know is that I spend about 95% of my day in product design, development and running the business. Yes, fitness will always be a part of my being, but entrepreneurship and creation is the thrill that keeps me wild with ideas. It is what keeps me problem solving and sketching and prototyping and testing! I LIVE for it.\n\nI got the chance to talk to Guy about my backstory, where I am now, and my hopes for the future. I\u2019m so not even close to where I want to be but I hope this interview inspires you to follow your passion - no matter if no one believes in you. You need to give yourself the 100% chance to succeed or else you\u2019ll always live a life of \u201cwhat if\u201d? I\u2019d rather try and fail hard than look back and wished I could have.\n\nHave a listen to my episode and let me know the biggest lesson you learned. https://open.spotify.com/episode/3eCTr41e5tMbC9IUsyQd3i?si=lzQyIDoMRSuVabHBeYENhw\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey",

                    "description": "I have a secret list of things I want to accomplish before I die.\n\nI call it my Dream List.\n\nI don\u2019t announce or really share these as they are my deepest most unapologetic desires and I choose to work towards them silently, without anyone\u2019s opinions distracting me from my goals.\n\nBut today\u2026it\u2019s time to share because one of the things on my Dream List is getting checked off!!! Honestly, I thought I was about 5-7 years away but, here we are, a little early.\n\nWhen I got the call from @How I Built This Podcasts (my fave podcast everrrr) I DIED. I was SCREAMING.\n\nI\u2019ve been listening to @Guy Raz and his soothing voice since the beginning of time, learning from some of the most inspiring entrepreneurs in the world! It has ALWAYS been a dream of mine to be on his podcast. My goal was to do something so impactful that Guy would find my story worthy enough of sharing amongst his other incredible leaders and innovators.\n\nMany of you know me from the free workout videos I\u2019ve uploaded to YouTube over the past 13 years. But what you don\u2019t know is that I spend about 95% of my day in product design, development and running the business. Yes, fitness will always be a part of my being, but entrepreneurship and creation is the thrill that keeps me wild with ideas. It is what keeps me problem solving and sketching and prototyping and testing! I LIVE for it.\n\nI got the chance to talk to Guy about my backstory, where I am now, and my hopes for the future. I\u2019m so not even close to where I want to be but I hope this interview inspires you to follow your passion - no matter if no one believes in you. You need to give yourself the 100% chance to succeed or else you\u2019ll always live a life of \u201cwhat if\u201d? I\u2019d rather try and fail hard than look back and wished I could have.\n\nHave a listen to my episode and let me know the biggest lesson you learned. https://open.spotify.com/episode/3eCTr41e5tMbC9IUsyQd3i?si=lzQyIDoMRSuVabHBeYENhw\n\n\u2665\ufe0fCassey"

I just learned how to make 30 sec almond milk and I AM FLOORED.\n\nNot only is it cheaper than the store bought kind, but it tastes better and the best part - it only has 2 ingredients. You can alter how milky, fatty or sweet you want it too!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n\ud83e\udd5c1-2 TBS of any nut butter (try to use one that is made of just nuts and salt)\n\ud83d\udca74 C water\n\nThen blend. That\u2019s it! If you like it sweeter, which I do, add some monk fruit sugar to taste. Drink what you need then save the rest in the fridge! Not sure how long it saves just yet and I DEFINITELY will be doing this going forward! I am so happy!!!\n\nWhat\u2019s your fave non-milk milk? Let me know in the comments!",

I just learned how to make 30 sec almond milk and I AM FLOORED.\n\nNot only is it cheaper than the store bought kind, but it tastes better and the best part - it only has 2 ingredients. You can alter how milky, fatty or sweet you want it too!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n\ud83e\udd5c1-2 TBS of any nut butter (try to use one that is made of just nuts and salt)\n\ud83d\udca74 C water\n\nThen blend. That\u2019s it! If you like it sweeter, which I do, add some monk fruit sugar to taste. Drink what you need then save the rest in the fridge! Not sure how long it saves just yet and I DEFINITELY will be doing this going forward! I am so happy!!!\n\nWhat\u2019s your fave non-milk milk? Let me know in the comments!"

                "description": "Tees. They have never looked good on me. So, I tried to create the \u2728perfect tee\u2728 for me.\n\nFinding the right tee is so hard because I want to be comfy and effortless but I still want to look feminine and stylish! Fitted ones look like they\u2019re trying to hard and loose ones make me look like a man.\n\nSooooooo this is what I did:\n\n1. Got a SUPER soft and stretchy fabric that DRAPED like a DREAM \u2601\ufe0f, so it could still be loose and comfy but would show my curves as I move!\n\n2. Upgraded the shape to a loose fit with a CURVED HEM to make the box look less boxy and more romantic. Plus didn\u2019t want it stomach-bearing, so I long-cropped it, making it easier to wear.\n\n3. Added stylish details like a rolled cuff and a stitch down the back. Didn\u2019t want to overdo a simple tee but could not bear releasing a super basic design! You know me. \ud83d\ude09 I needed quiet details. I needed something different, but subdued, so you could tell but couldn\u2019t really tell.\n\nI hope you like the @POPFLEX Active  Perfect Tee! I love how it looks on my body and hope you feel the same! Comes in 3 colors and there\u2019s a whole bundle too if you want to save some money! \u2728\nShop here \u27a1\ufe0f https://bit.ly/shop-perfect-tee\n\nEnjoy!",

                    "description": "Tees. They have never looked good on me. So, I tried to create the \u2728perfect tee\u2728 for me.\n\nFinding the right tee is so hard because I want to be comfy and effortless but I still want to look feminine and stylish! Fitted ones look like they\u2019re trying to hard and loose ones make me look like a man.\n\nSooooooo this is what I did:\n\n1. Got a SUPER soft and stretchy fabric that DRAPED like a DREAM \u2601\ufe0f, so it could still be loose and comfy but would show my curves as I move!\n\n2. Upgraded the shape to a loose fit with a CURVED HEM to make the box look less boxy and more romantic. Plus didn\u2019t want it stomach-bearing, so I long-cropped it, making it easier to wear.\n\n3. Added stylish details like a rolled cuff and a stitch down the back. Didn\u2019t want to overdo a simple tee but could not bear releasing a super basic design! You know me. \ud83d\ude09 I needed quiet details. I needed something different, but subdued, so you could tell but couldn\u2019t really tell.\n\nI hope you like the @POPFLEX Active  Perfect Tee! I love how it looks on my body and hope you feel the same! Comes in 3 colors and there\u2019s a whole bundle too if you want to save some money! \u2728\nShop here \u27a1\ufe0f https://bit.ly/shop-perfect-tee\n\nEnjoy!"

After the sketches, it\u2019s the pattern making that takes the reins.\n\nThe tiniest shape differentiations can cause the biggest problems or be our biggest victories!\n\nToday, we\u2019re exploring the difference between the traditional J shape butt seam vs a straighter butt seam that\u2019s featured in my new Cosmo biker short from @POPFLEX Active .\n\nBecause I have a smaller butt (and always will have thanks to genetics) I\u2019ll forever be extra interested in finding ways to enhance the shape of my booty naturally!\n\nFun fact: you have no idea how much I hated taking booty thumbnails for my YouTube videos! I had to arch my back and stick out my butt so hard and STILL people would say \u201cwhy don\u2019t you have a butt??\u201d\n\n\ud83d\ude21\n\nAnyway!\n\nThe Cosmo biker shorts amaze me because of the way it hugs my cheeks\u2026 separately! \ud83c\udf51 That\u2019s what the straighter seam does! And no it is not uncomfortable, and does not feel like a wedgie at all. It\u2019s because the thread stretches at the same rate as the fabric, so it does not hike up inside.\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re like me and have a hard time shopping for bottoms that hug your butt instead of make it sag (I have the hardest time with bikini bottoms ugh!) then you might want to try these @POPFLEX Active  Cosmo shorts!\n\n\nPs: These also happen to be the comfiest shorts I\u2019ve ever owned! The Airlite ButterSoft fabric is gummy and yummy! \u2601\ufe0f \n\nShop: https://bit.ly/CosmoBikerShort",

                    "description": "The Science of Fashion: Booty edition \ud83c\udf51\n\nTechnical design - it\u2019s what makes your clothes ACTUALLY fit and function! After the sketches, it\u2019s the pattern making that takes the reins.\n\nThe tiniest shape differentiations can cause the biggest problems or be our biggest victories!\n\nToday, we\u2019re exploring the difference between the traditional J shape butt seam vs a straighter butt seam that\u2019s featured in my new Cosmo biker short from @POPFLEX Active .\n\nBecause I have a smaller butt (and always will have thanks to genetics) I\u2019ll forever be extra interested in finding ways to enhance the shape of my booty naturally!\n\nFun fact: you have no idea how much I hated taking booty thumbnails for my YouTube videos! I had to arch my back and stick out my butt so hard and STILL people would say \u201cwhy don\u2019t you have a butt??\u201d\n\n\ud83d\ude21\n\nAnyway!\n\nThe Cosmo biker shorts amaze me because of the way it hugs my cheeks\u2026 separately! \ud83c\udf51 That\u2019s what the straighter seam does! And no it is not uncomfortable, and does not feel like a wedgie at all. It\u2019s because the thread stretches at the same rate as the fabric, so it does not hike up inside.\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re like me and have a hard time shopping for bottoms that hug your butt instead of make it sag (I have the hardest time with bikini bottoms ugh!) then you might want to try these @POPFLEX Active  Cosmo shorts!\n\n\nPs: These also happen to be the comfiest shorts I\u2019ve ever owned! The Airlite ButterSoft fabric is gummy and yummy! \u2601\ufe0f \n\nShop: https://bit.ly/CosmoBikerShort"

I've always preferred dance-like cardio workouts but I would do ANYTHING to avoid running, which even meant choosing burpees and HIIT workouts. Which says A LOT.\n\nBUT one day, my sister invited me to go run with her. At first I was like \"NOOOOOO you can't make me!!!\" (seriously, I was that dramatic) but when I did it, I actually kinda liked it!! Now, I actually wake up almost every morning and get ready for a run to start the day!\n\nIf I can do it, so can you!!!

Sam and I had just gotten off an international flight from Thailand, landed at LAX, and then boarded another flight to Minneapolis for one of the most important meetings of our lives.\n\nI sat there nervously for the sporting goods buyer from one of the biggest retailers in the US to walk into the room and hopefully not hate the designs I was about to show him. I heard he was a REALLY tough one.\n\nIt seemed like forever that I was sitting there, waiting and waiting...but then, the door swung open. As soon as he walked in, I launched full force into presentation mode! I showed him how our vegan suede yoga mats got grippier as our hands got sweatier. I showed him how our fit journals have helped you guys achieve your goals! I felt like if I could JUST get him to not look down at his laptop for the duration of the presentation, then maybe I had a chance!\n\nAfterwards, Sam and I weren't sure what to think. No purchase order was made. But he did ask a lot of questions. A good sign...right? We had no clue. This was only the second time in our life when we tried pitching a retailer. The first time was when we first started making yoga bags over 10 years ago, and that other retailer had totally passed on us. So we never really tried again, and instead put all our efforts into building our own ecommerce site.\n\nThe next day we flew back home, didn't tell anyone about our meeting, didn't get our hopes up, and just resumed normal life...until the definition of normal changed a few months later.\n\nI remember the toilet paper shortages, the hand sanitizer price surges, and the whole world just coming to a halt.

I've been a HUGE FAN of their quirky songs since \"Bed Intruder\" and \"Dead Giveaway\". OMG just thinking of \"Dead Giveaway\" makes me laugh.\n\nAnyway, I met The Gregory Brothers at the YouTube Creator Summit last year and I was like ummmmm would you be interested in collaborating!!??? I was so happy when they said yes! That is how this random music video came to be. They took one of my weird lines \"Good booty death\" and made a whole song out of it. OMG IT IS SO WEIRD BUT I LOVE IT.\n\nI hope you like the song!! Should I make a butt workout video to \"Good Booty Death\"??\n\nDownload the song here:\nApple music: https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-booty-death-single/1540754930?ls=1\niTunes: https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-booty-death-single/1540754930?ls=1&app=itunes\nSpotify URL: http://open.spotify.com/album/0FvSyU35AIJihl8ySC7L8g\nSpotify URI: spotify:album:0FvSyU35AIJihl8ySC7L8g\nSubscribe to Schmoyoho: https://www.youtube.com/c/songify\n\nChorus\nI am shaking\nMy butt is vibrating\nBoom my gosh, do you feel\nHooo whoooo the burn is real\nThe hamstrings are the elevator to the butt\nSo I am not giving up, I am not giving up\nI am dying, really dying\nFind your strength go even higher\nLook inside for your confidence\nMake them sexy straighten out that leg\nDie with me, gonna be a good booty death\nGood booty death x3\nGonna be a good booty death\nVerse\nYour body is going to be feeling it, but your spirit will also be lifted\nWe\u2019re nearing the end of the race, keep following the light to the ribbon\nGo even higher this time, find your strength\nLook inside for your confidence, don\u2019t shove it away\nYou could be doing this naked and I wouldn\u2019t even know\nBut PUT DOWN that can of coke!\nConfidence has to come from looking inside\nThen you\u2019ll love what you see in the mirror next time\nChorus\nIf you\u2019re holding a bag of chips, shove it away\nFocus on having fun, getting through butt day\nShove it away, shove it away\nFocus on having fun, getting through butt day\nMake sure you are working hard\nAre you having fun? \nI know you are!\nChorus\n\nDownload the Body by Blogilates app:  https://bit.ly/bodybyblogilatesapp\r\n\r\nMy outfit & yoga mat are from: http://www.popflexactive.com\r\n\r\nHere is where I get all of my music!

What aesthetics make you one of the most followed women in the female fitness category? And how does an ideal fitness influencer's body compare against the body of Instagram's top 100 most followed women vs the body of the average Blogilates fan vs the body of the average US woman?\n\nI listed out the top 100 fitness influencers on Instagram and compared them in the following categories:\n\nAge\nHeight\nEye color\nEye size\nHair color\nHair length\nDefinition on their stomach\nLip size\nSkin color\nEthnicity\nFace shape\nProminence of butt\nNose size\nOverall body shape\n\nI think you will be shocked to see the results. \n\nIf you like this video on decoding the beauty standards of the ideal fitness influencer, then you're definitely going to want to watch my first video in this series: \"Decoding the Instagram Beauty Standard\": https://youtu.be/5HJ8du5i_rE\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr122-508.pdf\n\nHere is where I get all of my music!

And guess what happens when you're popular? Everyone wants to be like you, talk like you, dress like you, look like you and pretty much BE YOU. \n\nSo, I wanted to decode the Instagram beauty standard for fitness influencers. What aesthetics make you one of the most followed women in the female fitness category? And how does an ideal fitness influencer's body compare against the body of Instagram's top 100 most followed women vs the body of the average Blogilates fan vs the body of the average US woman?\n\nI listed out the top 100 fitness influencers on Instagram and compared them in the following categories:\n\nAge\nHeight\nEye color\nEye size\nHair color\nHair length\nDefinition on their stomach\nLip size\nSkin color\nEthnicity\nFace shape\nProminence of butt\nNose size\nOverall body shape\n\nI think you will be shocked to see the results. \n\nIf you like this video on decoding the beauty standards of the ideal fitness influencer, then you're definitely going to want to watch my first video in this series: \"Decoding the Instagram Beauty Standard\": https://youtu.be/5HJ8du5i_rE\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr122-508.pdf\n\nHere is where I get all of my music!

And I wanted to see if we could tell which was most accurate. Or would we find out that labels are bogus?\n\nI started planning this video a year ago, and I had NO IDEA how to pull it off. Fast forward to shoot day and we had a 20+ person crew working on it AND we flew out one of the world's best female bodybuilders...from Sweden!!!! So crazy!!!!!!\n\nParts of this video were extremely uncomfortable to film, but I hope you guys take away the fact that there is so much more to a person than their number.\n\nI have so many people to thank for making this video happen - my amazing director Ryan, my husband Sam, the crew, the Blogifam...but most of all I want to thank all of the brave, strong women for speaking their truths.

And I wanted to see if we could tell which was most accurate. Or would we find out that labels are bogus?\n\nI started planning this video a year ago, and I had NO IDEA how to pull it off. Fast forward to shoot day and we had a 20+ person crew working on it AND we flew out one of the world's best female bodybuilders...from Sweden!!!! So crazy!!!!!!\n\nParts of this video were extremely uncomfortable to film, but I hope you guys take away the fact that there is so much more to a person than their number.\n\nI have so many people to thank for making this video happen - my amazing director Ryan, my husband Sam, the crew, the Blogifam...but most of all I want to thank all of the brave, strong women for speaking their truths.

                "description": "This year I had the INCREDIBLE HONOR of coming back to my Alma Mater, Whittier College and giving the Commencement Speech for the graduating Class of 2018! I really cannot believe it has been 9 years since I've graduated! Here's my speech. Hope it inspires you in some way!\n\n*****\n\n5 Things I Wish I Could Tell my 22-Year Old Self\nBy: Cassey Ho\n\nBeing back here on campus makes me so emotional. I mean, when I look at Stauffer, I can vividly see the moment my mom and dad left me as a little freshman crying my face off like an abandoned child as they drove away.\n\nWhen I look at the Science Building, I can see myself frantically walking up the stairs in a hoodie and top knot, trying to last minute memorize the 4 nitrogenous bases found in DNA. Guanine, Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine. Right Dr. Bourgaize?\n\nAnd when I look at the CI, I remember all the food I stuffed myself with because I treated every meal like I was at Hometown Buffet. Let\u2019s just say the Freshman 15 was very real.\n\nSeeing these buildings again and seeing my professors again makes me realize how much Whittier played a role in sculpting me into the person I am today. So many micro-decisions were made right here, that at the time, I thought were trivial. But they ended up changing the entire course of my career.\n\nGraduates, I am really excited to have the honor to speak to you today. From Poet to Poet and peer to peer, I really want to take this opportunity to have a real talk with you before you march across this stage into adulthood. If you\u2019re feeling lost or unsure of what you\u2019re meant to do, don\u2019t worry. That\u2019s normal. Your 20s are meant for figuring these things out. Actually, the rest of your life is meant for figuring things out, but hopefully you will have learned a few things by then.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not going to stand here and pretend that I know everything, because I don\u2019t! But I can tell you 5 things I wish I could have told my 22 year old self. \n\n#1. Love your parents. But know they\u2019re not always right.\n\nAs a child of strict Asian immigrant parents, I also grew up being falsely advertised that there were only 3 career options for me. For my Asian brothers and sisters out there, you know what I\u2019m talking about, right?! \n\nAnd if you don\u2019t, let me break it down for you.\n\nUs Asian kids only had the choice of becoming a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. That\u2019s it. Any other option was a disgrace to the family. \n\nMy dad decided he wanted a doctor in the family, so that was my fate. The problem was, I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with being a doctor. I had been sketching gowns ever since I was 6 - sewing clothes for my Barbies and then designing my friends\u2019 prom dresses. But when I told my dad that I wanted to be a fashion designer, he glared at me and said:\n\n\u201cNo. You will do no such thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIf you become a fashion designer, you will be poor. You will be unsuccessful. So...you know what that means, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means you will have NO FRIENDS!\u201d\n\nLooking back, I think it was the \u201cno friends\u201d part that really got to me. So I dutifully accepted my fate, tucked my dream away, and went off to major in Biology and minor in Business.\n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be long before I realized how painful it was to be living out someone else\u2019s dream while sacrificing my own.\n\n#2. Take responsibility for your own destiny.\n\n...you can read the rest of my commencement speech at http://www.blogilates.com\n\n\n******\n\nCassey Ho is an award-winning fitness instructor, entrepreneur and online personality.

Go to http://23andMe.com/blogilates to save $30 on a Health + Ancestry kit, now through January 31st.\n\nI did the 23andme genetic testing service and OMG guys, it explains so much about my weight. Growing up I ALWAYS had trouble losing weight. I was the chubby kid. I was the fat one. When it came to working out and dieting, I had to train so hard and eat so clean to only see results that don't even compare the girls who can eat junk food all day and still have flat abs. So it always made me wonder, am I just supposed to be \"fat\"? Am I predestined to have a soft body with no ab definition? Is it in my genes - my DNA - to weigh more?\n\nWatch this video to find out what my DNA says about my weight. You'll find the information shocking.

Go to http://23andMe.com/blogilates to save $30 on a Health + Ancestry kit, now through January 31st.\n\nI did the 23andme genetic testing service and OMG guys, it explains so much about my weight. Growing up I ALWAYS had trouble losing weight. I was the chubby kid. I was the fat one. When it came to working out and dieting, I had to train so hard and eat so clean to only see results that don't even compare the girls who can eat junk food all day and still have flat abs. So it always made me wonder, am I just supposed to be \"fat\"? Am I predestined to have a soft body with no ab definition? Is it in my genes - my DNA - to weigh more?\n\nWatch this video to find out what my DNA says about my weight. You'll find the information shocking. It pretty much explains why there is no such thing as a diet or a workout that works for everyone. We are all so different. \n\nHere is where I get all of my music!

These are the headphones I used in the video - Gear IconX: http://bit.ly/2CcCis5\n\n2. I turn my workout into a game. I try to beat my score (heart rate or steps) everyday! The I reward myself for a job well done! This is the watch I used in the video - Gear Sport: http://bit.ly/2kj5YA2\n\n3. I keep a gym bag in my car with shoes, socks, clothes, headphones, and a towel so I'm always prepared to work out! No excuses!\n\n4. I find something I love so much that working out does not feel like a chore.\n\n5.  I exercise while watching my fave Netflix or TV shows. I only allow myself to watch when I exercise.\n\n6. When possible, I try to wear workout clothes wherever I go! This allows me to impromptu work out on a whim!

                    "description": "If everyone around you is getting super motivated in you're just like \"I wanna eat forever and be a koala\" then I have some hacks that might make getting healthy and getting active a little bit easier :)\n\nHere are 6 tricks I use to motivate myself to work out! Thanks to Samsung for sponsoring this video!\n\n1. I prepare a playlist that matches the length of my workout so that I don't constantly glance at the timer. These are the headphones I used in the video - Gear IconX: http://bit.ly/2CcCis5\n\n2. I turn my workout into a game. I try to beat my score (heart rate or steps) everyday! The I reward myself for a job well done! This is the watch I used in the video - Gear Sport: http://bit.ly/2kj5YA2\n\n3. I keep a gym bag in my car with shoes, socks, clothes, headphones, and a towel so I'm always prepared to work out! No excuses!\n\n4. I find something I love so much that working out does not feel like a chore.\n\n5.  I exercise while watching my fave Netflix or TV shows. I only allow myself to watch when I exercise.\n\n6. When possible, I try to wear workout clothes wherever I go! This allows me to impromptu work out on a whim! I want to always be prepared!\n\n******\n\nCassey Ho is an award-winning fitness instructor, entrepreneur and online personality.

It didn't feel good. And I don't want to enter the new year feeling this way anymore. So if you're up for it, I challenge you to take the 2018 Reset Challenge with me. You in?!\n\nThe 2018 Reset Challenge rules:\n\n1. Challenge begins Jan 1, 2018. Take a before picture (front/side/back) in a bikini or in sports bra and shorts.\n\n2. PART 1 - THE FOOD: You will only eat Reset-friendly foods.\n\n3. PART 2 - THE WORKOUT: You will be active for 30 minutes a day, 6x a week.\n\n4. Challenge ends Jan 28, 2018. Take an after picture (front/side/back) all from the same angle and in the same outfit as your before picture. Share your results with hashtag #28dayreset!\n\nFREE 28 DAY RESET PDF: http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2017/12/26/your-2018-reset-challenge-is/\nPERFECT 10 COOKBOOK: https://www.piit28.com/store/rL9wMXto\n\nThe challenge is only 28 days long, but will set you up for a lifetime of understanding your body. Having acne, feeling bloated, being tired, and carrying around extra \"stubborn\" fat doesn't feel good, and you deserve nothing less than feeling amazing. The truth is, we've gotten used to thinking the above is \"normal\". But it doesn't have to be your normal. Your normal should be your best. \n\nGood luck guys! Let's show 2018 who's BOSS!!!!\n\nHere is where I get all of my music!

                    "description": "Are you ready to take on a challenge that will give you the momentum you need to make a lasting change in your body and your mindset...for the rest of your life?\n\nGood, because I am too. 2017 was a rough year for me personally and professionally, so that ended up affecting how I ate and how much time I had to exercise. It didn't feel good. And I don't want to enter the new year feeling this way anymore. So if you're up for it, I challenge you to take the 2018 Reset Challenge with me. You in?!\n\nThe 2018 Reset Challenge rules:\n\n1. Challenge begins Jan 1, 2018. Take a before picture (front/side/back) in a bikini or in sports bra and shorts.\n\n2. PART 1 - THE FOOD: You will only eat Reset-friendly foods.\n\n3. PART 2 - THE WORKOUT: You will be active for 30 minutes a day, 6x a week.\n\n4. Challenge ends Jan 28, 2018. Take an after picture (front/side/back) all from the same angle and in the same outfit as your before picture. Share your results with hashtag #28dayreset!\n\nFREE 28 DAY RESET PDF: http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2017/12/26/your-2018-reset-challenge-is/\nPERFECT 10 COOKBOOK: https://www.piit28.com/store/rL9wMXto\n\nThe challenge is only 28 days long, but will set you up for a lifetime of understanding your body. Having acne, feeling bloated, being tired, and carrying around extra \"stubborn\" fat doesn't feel good, and you deserve nothing less than feeling amazing. The truth is, we've gotten used to thinking the above is \"normal\". But it doesn't have to be your normal. Your normal should be your best. \n\nGood luck guys! Let's show 2018 who's BOSS!!!!\n\nHere is where I get all of my music!

Over the course of the next 6 weeks, I will release super focused videos targeting all muscle groups of your body to get you strong and lean for summer using only bodyweight! They are \"PIIT\" style - so you will be challenged - but there will be no explosive jumping movements so you can do this at your home or apartment! \n\nEach video must be done 4 times through in one session to give you a full 28 minute workout. The 6-Week challenge is to do the workout of the week at least once that week. Do that for 6 consecutive weeks and you will be so much more than bikini body ready...you're gonna be life body ready!\n\nThe week 1 workout is \"Booty Focus\" so will be all about that butt. You will do each exercise 45 sec through with 15 sec of rest in between.  Your 7 moves are:\n\n1. Double pulse squat\n2. Straight leg pulse R\n3. Alternating lunges\n4. Straight leg pulse L\n5. Squat Lunges\n6. Standing Ham Curl R\n7. Standing Ham Curl L\n\nHave fun!\n\nMy outfit & yoga mat are from: http://www.popflexactive.com\n\n******\n\nCassey Ho is an award-winning fitness instructor, entrepreneur and online personality.
