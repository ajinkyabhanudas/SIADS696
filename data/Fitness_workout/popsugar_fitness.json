Once a young ballerina in training, boxing fanatic Julie \"Jaws\" Nelson was consistently told she just didn't have what it took to dance alongside the best. That's when she decided to make a turn. Using her fine-tuned discipline and natural artistic technique, she now fuses her two passions together to cross-train and shine in the boxing ring.

                "description": "When it comes to long-distance running, it's all about the prep work. First, you need to build up your base mileage, then you need to train your body for the long haul. We took on the latter and created three intervals designed to help you gain endurance over time. By starting with a brisk walk and working your way up to a swift run, you'll conquer that 5K in no time. Watch the video above or follow along below to see how it's done.\n\n1. Walk/Jog\n\nWhen you're just starting out, proper form and recovery time is much more important than speed.\n\n5 minutes: warm up gently with a moderate walk that gradually increases\n1 minute: begin an easy jog\n2 minutes: follow with brisk walk to recover\nRepeat 10 times\n5 minutes: walk to cool down\n\n2. Walk/Run\n\nOnce you're comfortable with jogging, you can slowly increase your pace.\n\n5 minutes: walk briskly to warm up\n30 seconds: run at a swift pace\n90 seconds: speed walk to recover\nRepeat 10 times\n5 minutes: walk to cool down\n\n3. Jog/Run Pyramid\n\nAs you progress into running, get the most out of your training by adding muscle-building sprints. In this interval, push yourself and recover for equal periods of time.\n\n5 minutes: warm up with a moderate jog\n1 minute: 30 seconds at a fast pace/30 seconds to recover\n2 minutes: 1 minute at a fast pace/1 minute to recover\n4 minutes: 2 minutes at a fast pace/2 minutes to recover\n8 minutes: 4 minutes at a fast pace/4 minutes to recover\n4 minutes: 2 minutes at a fast pace/2 minutes to recover\n2 minutes: 1 minute at a fast pace/1 minute to recover\n1 minute: 30 seconds at a fast pace/30 seconds to recover\n10 minutes: walk to cool down\n\nWe've partnered with adidas Running to prep you for your next 5K.",
