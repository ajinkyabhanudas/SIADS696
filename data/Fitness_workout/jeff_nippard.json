Try out the MacroFactor nutrition app for 2 weeks free: http://bit.ly/jeffmacrofactor (use code JEFF)\n\nI like to think of maingaining as a type of body recomposition where your goal is to maintain your bodyweight while gaining strength, and ideally, some muscle mass as well. For me that usually comes toward the end of an extended bulk, before starting a cut, but you can always just ride the maingain or recomp wave as long as it's working for you. I think it's better done at a moderate to slightly higher bodyfat percentage, in the 10-20% zone as a male or the 20-30% zone as a female.

The first level covers the basics: you need to lift and eat protein. Level 2 goes one layer deeper covering progressive overload and daily protein intake (how much protein per day?). Level 3 covers effort, training volume, intensity, exercise selection and frequency. Level 4 gets more granular, describing exactly what causes muscle growth through a critical evaluation of the three-factor model (mechanical tension, muscle damage and metabolic stress). On this level, we address questions like \"what role does soreness play in hypertrophy?\" and \"how much is the pump driving muscle growth?\" Level 5 is a deep dive into the biochemistry of muscle growth: the physiological impacts of tension, amino acids (leucine, EAAs) and testosterone.\n\n0:00 - Introducing the levels\n0:30 - Level 1: Noob\n1:25 - Level 2: Novice\n4:23 - Level 3: Average\n10:03 - Level 4: Elite\n15:50 - Level 5: Pro\n\n-------------------------------\n\nReferences:\n\nTotal Daily Protein Target:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28698222/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5828430/\n\nTraining Volume:\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-new-approach-to-training-volume/\n\nTraining Intensity:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564973/\n\nTraining Frequency:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558493/\n\nRest Periods: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR94rNsArv0\nTempo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQxMvpe2lQ8\nIntensity Techniques: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri0v5-osLCQ\n\nMechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20847704/\n\nMuscle Damage:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30335577/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29282529/\n\n*Footnote on Metabolic Stress:\n\nWhile I personally think it makes the most sense, it actually isn't perfectly clear if shorter rest periods do in fact increase metabolic stress compared to longer rest periods.

Level 3 covers effort, training volume, intensity, exercise selection and frequency. Level 4 gets more granular, describing exactly what causes muscle growth through a critical evaluation of the three-factor model (mechanical tension, muscle damage and metabolic stress).

I earn a commission when you shop through the link below:\nhttp://rise.ca/jeff\n\n4 common myths about posture are:\n\n1. Upright posture is good, and slouching is bad. In reality, rather than thinking about posture as good and bad, we should make an effort to vary our body positions throughout the day. \n\n2. If you fix your posture, you will fix your pain. In reality, the link between posture and pain is not well established in the scientific literature. Resistance training, regular cardio/walking and modifying tasks with a physical therapist until pain subsides are some of the better strategies. \n\n3. You can fix poor posture with simple 10 minute daily drills and stretches. In reality, progressive resistance training with a focus on getting stronger is more likely to improve your ability to deal with postural challenges. \n\n4. Bad posture is always a problem worth fixing. In reality, people who worry about their posture a lot, tend to experience and catastrophize pain more than those who do not. It simply may not be a problem worth fixing for you, and that's okay. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nSources & Recommended Reading\n\nLink Between Posture and Pain Studies:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33290371/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29306972/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11345632/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16963312/\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/221853491\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16015238/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19910263/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27475532/\n\nNocebo Study:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24780622/\n\nSymptoms Decrease with Time Study:\nhttps://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m18-1468\n\nA GREAT resource on all things pain and posture:\nhttps://www.painscience.com/articles/posture.php\n\n-------------------------------\n\nMusic:\nBankrupt Beats:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iN7jlPJhyQ\n\nEpidemic Sound\n\nB Roll Filmed by Aous Photo:\nhttps://aousphoto.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/aousphoto/?hl=en\n\nEdited by Brandon Wells Photo and me using Final Cut Pro!\nhttp://www.brandonwellsphotography.com/\n\n-------------------------------\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\nINSTAGRAM \u2023 http://instagram.com/jeffnippard\nSNAPCHAT \u2023 http://snapchat.com/add/jeffnippard\nFACEBOOK \u2023 http://facebook.com/jeffnippard\nTWITTER \u2023 http://twitter.com/jeffnippard\nPODCAST \u2023 The Jeff Nippard Podcast on iTunes and Stitcher\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

I earn a commission when you shop through the link below:\nhttp://rise.ca/jeff\n\n4 common myths about posture are:\n\n1. Upright posture is good, and slouching is bad. In reality, rather than thinking about posture as good and bad, we should make an effort to vary our body positions throughout the day. \n\n2. If you fix your posture, you will fix your pain. In reality, the link between posture and pain is not well established in the scientific literature. Resistance training, regular cardio/walking and modifying tasks with a physical therapist until pain subsides are some of the better strategies. \n\n3. You can fix poor posture with simple 10 minute daily drills and stretches. In reality, progressive resistance training with a focus on getting stronger is more likely to improve your ability to deal with postural challenges. \n\n4. Bad posture is always a problem worth fixing. In reality, people who worry about their posture a lot, tend to experience and catastrophize pain more than those who do not. It simply may not be a problem worth fixing for you, and that's okay. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nSources & Recommended Reading\n\nLink Between Posture and Pain Studies:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33290371/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29306972/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11345632/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16963312/\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/221853491\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16015238/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19910263/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27475532/\n\nNocebo Study:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24780622/\n\nSymptoms Decrease with Time Study:\nhttps://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m18-1468\n\nA GREAT resource on all things pain and posture:\nhttps://www.painscience.com/articles/posture.php\n\n-------------------------------\n\nMusic:\nBankrupt Beats:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iN7jlPJhyQ\n\nEpidemic Sound\n\nB Roll Filmed by Aous Photo:\nhttps://aousphoto.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/aousphoto/?hl=en\n\nEdited by Brandon Wells Photo and me using Final Cut Pro!\nhttp://www.brandonwellsphotography.com/\n\n-------------------------------\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\nINSTAGRAM \u2023 http://instagram.com/jeffnippard\nSNAPCHAT \u2023 http://snapchat.com/add/jeffnippard\nFACEBOOK \u2023 http://facebook.com/jeffnippard\nTWITTER \u2023 http://twitter.com/jeffnippard\nPODCAST \u2023 The Jeff Nippard Podcast on iTunes and Stitcher\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

It's not good for beginners (Athlean-X)\n2. People are using it to \"hide behind science\" (Athlean-X)\n3. It's for p_______  (Greg Doucette and Mark Rippetoe)\n4. RPE isn't accurate (No one in specific)\n5.

A lot of people seem to think you can\u2019t, (or you shouldn\u2019t) because how you should train to get strong is supposedly very different from how you should train to get big. But I don\u2019t quite agree with this. \n\nIt\u2019s common to hear that if you want to get strong, you need to lift heavy weights for low reps and if you want to get big, you need to lift light to moderate weights for relatively higher reps. \nMost personal trainers and textbooks outline clear and distinct rep zones for strength, hypertrophy and endurance. For strength: you lift heavy, for size: you lift moderate and for endurance: you lift light. And while there is some truth to this, it doesn\u2019t capture the full picture.\n\nThe bottom line is: unless you\u2019re going really, ridiculously light, heavy weights (low reps) AND light weights (high reps) are BOTH effective at building muscle. However, when it comes to strength, the rep range really does seem to matter: it is important to lift heavy to maximize top-end strength development. \n\nIn this video I will describe periodization and progression examples for powerbuilding (powerliftng plus bodybuilding) based on these principles.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSources:\n\nMASS Volume 2, Issue 5 (http://bit.ly/jeffMASS)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564973/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24714538/\n\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/\nhttp://www.kylehuntfitness.com/in-defense-of-powerlifting-why-its-not-hurting-bodybuilding/\n\nVideo was filmed at Florida Extreme Fitness Center in Jacksonville, Fl!

A lot of people seem to think you can\u2019t, (or you shouldn\u2019t) because how you should train to get strong is supposedly very different from how you should train to get big. But I don\u2019t quite agree with this. \n\nIt\u2019s common to hear that if you want to get strong, you need to lift heavy weights for low reps and if you want to get big, you need to lift light to moderate weights for relatively higher reps. \nMost personal trainers and textbooks outline clear and distinct rep zones for strength, hypertrophy and endurance. For strength: you lift heavy, for size: you lift moderate and for endurance: you lift light. And while there is some truth to this, it doesn\u2019t capture the full picture.\n\nThe bottom line is: unless you\u2019re going really, ridiculously light, heavy weights (low reps) AND light weights (high reps) are BOTH effective at building muscle. However, when it comes to strength, the rep range really does seem to matter: it is important to lift heavy to maximize top-end strength development. \n\nIn this video I will describe periodization and progression examples for powerbuilding (powerliftng plus bodybuilding) based on these principles.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSources:\n\nMASS Volume 2, Issue 5 (http://bit.ly/jeffMASS)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564973/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24714538/\n\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/\nhttp://www.kylehuntfitness.com/in-defense-of-powerlifting-why-its-not-hurting-bodybuilding/\n\nVideo was filmed at Florida Extreme Fitness Center in Jacksonville, Fl!

Just because an EMG study shows higher EMG amplitude does not necessarily guarantee that there is greater muscle activation  (although this is most likely assuming the procedure was carried out correctly). In videos, I typically use the phrase \"muscle activation\" as an approximation to shortcut this bit of nuance.\n\nHowever, greater muscle activation still doesn't guarantee greater hypertrophy over time, as there are situations when muscles can hypertrophy in the absence of activation (such as when being stretched). Still, in my opinion, if all else is equal, there is good reason to think that *some activation* should lead to better muscle growth than *no activation* and that *more activation* should lead to more muscle growth than *less activation*. At this point, there is a big question mark in the literature as to just how much EMG evidence lends credence to long-term muscle hypertrophy. Based on some correlations in the data, I suspect that it is actually more useful than much of the online fitness community seems to think at this moment in time, but skepticism should still be exercised.\n\nIn this video, I am *not* using EMG evidence to say \"Exercise X is better than Exercise Y\" but rather to prove the conceptual point that all heads of the delts are active to an appreciable degree in the OHP. Since this finding also makes sense biomechanically (given the combination of shoulder flexion and shoulder abduction present in the OHP) I believe this is a fair corroborative application of this research.\n\nStudy cited: Saeterbakken et al, 2013\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23096062/\n\nFilmed and edited by Rashaun R and me using Final Cut Pro X and Sony A7R3\n\u2023https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnG0SHgQJm9CcZWIEgRnMw\n\nFilmed at 24 hour Body And Soul in Kelowna, BC\nhttps://www.bodyandsoulkelowna.com/\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

In videos, I typically use the phrase \"muscle activation\" as an approximation to shortcut this bit of nuance.\n\nHowever, greater muscle activation still doesn't guarantee greater hypertrophy over time, as there are situations when muscles can hypertrophy in the absence of activation (such as when being stretched). Still, in my opinion, if all else is equal, there is good reason to think that *some activation* should lead to better muscle growth than *no activation* and that *more activation* should lead to more muscle growth than *less activation*. At this point, there is a big question mark in the literature as to just how much EMG evidence lends credence to long-term muscle hypertrophy. Based on some correlations in the data, I suspect that it is actually more useful than much of the online fitness community seems to think at this moment in time, but skepticism should still be exercised.\n\nIn this video, I am *not* using EMG evidence to say \"Exercise X is better than Exercise Y\" but rather to prove the conceptual point that all heads of the delts are active to an appreciable degree in the OHP. Since this finding also makes sense biomechanically (given the combination of shoulder flexion and shoulder abduction present in the OHP) I believe this is a fair corroborative application of this research.\n\nStudy cited: Saeterbakken et al, 2013\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23096062/\n\nFilmed and edited by Rashaun R and me using Final Cut Pro X and Sony A7R3\n\u2023https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnG0SHgQJm9CcZWIEgRnMw\n\nFilmed at 24 hour Body And Soul in Kelowna, BC\nhttps://www.bodyandsoulkelowna.com/\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

This is a very unique training style that uses the highest possible frequency of training (hitting every muscle 5 days a week). Full body training has several advantages including:\n\n- Reduced soreness = better performance\n- Improved recovery capacity = more progress\n- Improved mind-muscle connection per exercise = more focus\n- High quality volumes = better muscle growth\n\nAlso includes:\n\n- EXACT sets, reps, exercises, rest time, RPE targets\n- Exercise substitutions\n- Video links for every exercise\n- Full summaries of volume for every bodypart\n- \u201cProgram Explained\u201d section\n- A full FAQ\u2019s section\n- 39 scientific references\n\nGet it here: http://jeffnippard.com\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSUGGESTED VIDEOS\n\nWatch my Science Explained video on high frequency full body training:\n\u2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxO5ZMxcsc\n\nWatch my Sumo Deadlift technique tuesday video:\n\u2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsrD5y8EIKU\n\nDean Somerset's video showing lat engagement in the deadlift\n\u2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrpbWWKWKIU\n\n-------------------------------\n\nHelp SUPPORT the channel by:\n\n1.

For those who underwent anti-recomposition, the goal should be body recomposition, simultaneously gaining muscle and losing fat. To do this, first, set calories at about maintenance. For the macronutrients, set protein high (1.1-1.5 g/lb BW), fat low (\u226420% total calories), and carbs high (fill in the rest of the calories). Lastly, emphasize peak variables, such as protein timing (e.g. pre- and post-workout protein, and pre-sleep protein), protein distribution (meals no further than 4 hours apart), along with creatine supplementation. For pure muscle loss, we\u2019ll be setting up an aggressive short-term bulk, until muscle size is regained. In terms of the specific macronutrient targets, aim for the same protein and fat intakes as the anti-recomposition diet, but bump carbohydrates up much higher. Lastly, for pure fat gain, we\u2019ll run a mini-cut, entering a 20-25% caloric deficit and aiming for about one percent body weight loss per week.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCES:\n\nScientific References:\n \nMuscle Memory\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/45660034\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29382913\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1827108\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30978433\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991013\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513448\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/338056052\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32017951\n\nBody Recomposition\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482093\n \nProtein \nhttps://revivestronger.com/the-mini-cut-manual/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26500462\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/292154332\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/322973405\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/305821271\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875183\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12144197\n \nCarbohydrates and Fat\nhttps://examine.com/nutrition/eating-fat-make-you-fat/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864135\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/15601204\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/12294352\n \nMeal Timing and Distribution\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30068354/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30895177\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/235381974\n \n \nCreatine\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12701815\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/317612254\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8828669\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1327657\n \nRegaining Too Quickly\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23679146/\n\n\nMUSIC\nEpidemic Sound\n\u2023 Ryan Little - For Hyrule!\n\u2023 https://www.youtube.com/user/TheR4C2010\n\nFilmed and edited by me and Rashaun R using Final Cut Pro X and Sony A7R3\n\nRashaun's YouTube:\n\u2023https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnG0SHgQJm9CcZWIEgRnMw\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

Research shows that we tend to lose muscle very quickly with complete bed rest - mostly due to suppressed muscle protein synthesis. Doing any kind of physical activity, though, will maintain muscle much better than doing nothing. There are three main factors that will determine how quickly you lose muscle mass: physical activity level (bed rest vs everyday activities vs minimal bodyweight workouts vs weight training), caloric intake, and protein intake. Research shows us that you can prevent muscle loss through training (even minimal bodyweight workouts) and diet (eating at maintenance calories and consuming sufficient protein, 1.6-2.2 g/kg).

                "description": "Gyms are likely to be closed for at least 1-2 months. This is how I'd recommend adjusting your training with that new information in mind. \n\nWatch my last video on At-Home training:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MRNjTr6xrE\n\nPlease visit these websites to stay up to date with COVID-19:\nhttp://cdc.gov, http://who.int\n\nWatch my most popular science videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4G6oBUcv8z7yIq95QM2zVl1h33gfhDr\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe coronavirus quarantine has caused most of us to change our workouts. In this video I am breaking down how beginners and early intermediates needs are slightly different than those of late intermediate and advanced lifters. Here are some key points for each:\n\nBeginners - Early Intermediates:\n\nBased on the research we have, even doing 1/9 of the training volume needed to build muscle is enough to maintain muscle. This tells us that doing SOMETHING that applies a tensile stimulus to the muscle is better than doing NOTHING. Train hard, be consistent and stay motivated, even when training at home. Follow the principles in my last at-home workout video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MRNjTr6xrE\n\nLate Intermediate - Advanced:\n\nBecause more stimulus is required for progress, it makes sense that more stimulus will also be required for muscle maintenance in this group. This means that during the time of gym closure, maintaining muscle will be more difficult. Still even if muscle is lost, research on muscle memory tells us that it can be rebuilt quite quickly once regular training resumes. I have three pieces of advice here:\n\n1. Consider investing in some basic gym equipment. If you've been thinking about building a garage gym or at home gym, this could be the chance to take some action on that. \n\n2. Remain motivated and train hard! Even experienced lifters will be able to maintain muscle MUCH better by having a positive outlook than by giving up. Even if some strength loss occurs. \n\n3.

                    "description": "Gyms are likely to be closed for at least 1-2 months. This is how I'd recommend adjusting your training with that new information in mind. \n\nWatch my last video on At-Home training:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MRNjTr6xrE\n\nPlease visit these websites to stay up to date with COVID-19:\nhttp://cdc.gov, http://who.int\n\nWatch my most popular science videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4G6oBUcv8z7yIq95QM2zVl1h33gfhDr\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe coronavirus quarantine has caused most of us to change our workouts. In this video I am breaking down how beginners and early intermediates needs are slightly different than those of late intermediate and advanced lifters. Here are some key points for each:\n\nBeginners - Early Intermediates:\n\nBased on the research we have, even doing 1/9 of the training volume needed to build muscle is enough to maintain muscle. This tells us that doing SOMETHING that applies a tensile stimulus to the muscle is better than doing NOTHING. Train hard, be consistent and stay motivated, even when training at home. Follow the principles in my last at-home workout video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MRNjTr6xrE\n\nLate Intermediate - Advanced:\n\nBecause more stimulus is required for progress, it makes sense that more stimulus will also be required for muscle maintenance in this group. This means that during the time of gym closure, maintaining muscle will be more difficult. Still even if muscle is lost, research on muscle memory tells us that it can be rebuilt quite quickly once regular training resumes. I have three pieces of advice here:\n\n1. Consider investing in some basic gym equipment. If you've been thinking about building a garage gym or at home gym, this could be the chance to take some action on that. \n\n2. Remain motivated and train hard! Even experienced lifters will be able to maintain muscle MUCH better by having a positive outlook than by giving up. Even if some strength loss occurs. \n\n3. Enter a caloric surplus and then aim for body recomposition once gyms reopen. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nHelp SUPPORT the channel by:\n\n1.

I also give some nutritional advice for either losing fat or building muscle while training from home! I break the exercises down into 4 categories:\n\n1. Leg Exercises\n2. Push Exercises\n3. Pull Exercises\n4. Isolation Exercises\n\nI recommend doing 3-5 full body workouts per week, 1-2 exercises per muscle (or per \"category\") and 3-4 sets per exercises per bodypart. The extra rep range is not as important as simply training close to failure. High reps are effective for building and maintaining muscle IF you go close to failure. I recommend stopping 1-3 reps shy on most sets and optionally taking the last set to failure with good form. Exactly how much volume you need will depend on your advancement level, so I am keeping things very general for now.

This is a very unique training style that uses the highest possible frequency of training (hitting every muscle 5 days a week). Full body training has several advantages including:\n\n- Reduced soreness = better performance\n- Improved recovery capacity = more progress\n- Improved mind-muscle connection per exercise = more focus\n- High quality volumes = better muscle growth\n\nAlso includes:\n\n- EXACT sets, reps, exercises, rest time, RPE targets\n- Exercise substitutions\n- Video links for every exercise\n- Full summaries of volume for every bodypart\n- \u201cProgram Explained\u201d section\n- A full FAQ\u2019s section\n- 39 scientific references\n\nGet it here: http://jeffnippard.com\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWatch my Science Explained video on high frequency full body training:\n\u2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxO5ZMxcsc\n\nWarm Up Science Applied video:\n\u2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E81GN-3A8XM\n\n-------------------------------\n\nHelp SUPPORT the channel by:\n\n1.

This is when people focus on minutia not driving progress which can distract from the things that really matter. Examples of this include organic vs conventional foods, the glycemic index and meal timing. Total daily caloric intake and total daily protein intake will determine the majority of results when it comes to fat loss or muscle gain, so these smaller factors should be built around these main principles, not the other way around.\n\nThe second mistake is when people think in \"good or bad\" terms. This is so common in the mainstream media where you see the target shifting from fats being bad, to carbs being bad, to carbs being ok, but sugar is bad, whereas in reality, there are so many shades of grey to these blanket statements. \n\nMistake number three is making sudden, drastic changes to your diet. This is really common in the new year when motivation is high and people want results right away. But rather than cutting by crash dieting, a more gradual rate of weight loss will help prevent muscle loss. When bulking, a slower approach will also prevent unwanted fat gain. \n\nMistake number four is relying on nutrition documentaries as a legitimate source of information. This includes The Game Changers, Supersize Me, What The Health, and pretty much ANY other popular documentary you can suggest. They\u2019re generally created by producers that already have an idea in mind that they then try to prove to you.\n\nThe final mistake is focusing too much on supplements. As a beginner, I think the only supplement I\u2019d strongly recommend is whey protein powder, using creatine and caffeine optionally to give you an extra edge. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nHelp SUPPORT the channel by:\n\n1.

Once you\u2019ve got the proper techniques handled, then you can start adding one or two sets per week over the next month or two as you assess your progress, working your way up through the 12-20 set \u201coptimal zone\u201d. \nThird: Increase frequency. If you\u2019re currently only hitting your chest once per week on Monday, start hitting it twice per week.\n\nStep 1: Modify Your Bench Press Technique\n\nThe first modification is to use slightly lighter weights for higher reps. The second way we want to modify our bench technique is by bringing our grip slightly in. Even though you won\u2019t be able to move as much weight this way, if you\u2019re more concerned with developing your upper chest, a closer grip will likely hit the upper fibers better.\n\nStep 2: Add More Incline Presses\n\nThe reason I\u2019m using dumbbells over barbells here is that you will be able to get a bit more range of motion with the extra stretch at the bottom: so the short comings of the barbell press are overcome by also including dumbbells. A cue I like to use on the incline press to drive upper chest focus is to keep the elbows moderately tucked and think about pressing the dumbbells up and back toward your face, rather than just straight up.\n\nStep 3: Incorporate more non-traditional exercises\n\nThe reverse grip bench press, band press and banded push-ups are the three movements we can consider including. I\u2019m personally a bit more wary of the guillotine press as it just feels too risky to me, so I\u2019d stick with the banded push up and the banded incline press for higher reps in the 15-20 range to see if you feel them working your upper chest.\n\nStep 4: Fill in further volume with isolation work\n\nI like low to high cable flyes. While dumbbell flyes can be effective for really stretching out the pecs at the bottom, they lose tension at the top. When pulling the cables from low to high, you can mimic the exact orientation of the clavicular fibers, which also run low to high. You might feel this in your front delts (and that\u2019s ok) but if you really focus on the mind-muscle connection and actively squeezing your pecs together, you should feel your upper pecs contracting the most. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\nInstagram \u2023 http://instagram.com/jeffnippard\nFacebook \u2023 http://facebook.com/jeffnippard\nTwitter \u2023 http://twitter.com/jeffnippard\nPodcast \u2023 The Jeff Nippard Podcast on iTunes and Stitcher\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCES:\n\nAlan Aragon's Research Review AARR August 2015 Issue: https://alanaragon.com/aarr/\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/how-to-bench/\nhttps://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:714265\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095407\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20093960\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20512064\n\n\nFilmed and edited by Rashaun R and me using Final Cut Pro X and Sony A7R3\n\nRashaun's YouTube:\n\u2023https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnG0SHgQJm9CcZWIEgRnMw\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

Once you\u2019ve got the proper techniques handled, then you can start adding one or two sets per week over the next month or two as you assess your progress, working your way up through the 12-20 set \u201coptimal zone\u201d. \nThird: Increase frequency. If you\u2019re currently only hitting your chest once per week on Monday, start hitting it twice per week.\n\nStep 1: Modify Your Bench Press Technique\n\nThe first modification is to use slightly lighter weights for higher reps. The second way we want to modify our bench technique is by bringing our grip slightly in. Even though you won\u2019t be able to move as much weight this way, if you\u2019re more concerned with developing your upper chest, a closer grip will likely hit the upper fibers better.\n\nStep 2: Add More Incline Presses\n\nThe reason I\u2019m using dumbbells over barbells here is that you will be able to get a bit more range of motion with the extra stretch at the bottom: so the short comings of the barbell press are overcome by also including dumbbells. A cue I like to use on the incline press to drive upper chest focus is to keep the elbows moderately tucked and think about pressing the dumbbells up and back toward your face, rather than just straight up.\n\nStep 3: Incorporate more non-traditional exercises\n\nThe reverse grip bench press, band press and banded push-ups are the three movements we can consider including. I\u2019m personally a bit more wary of the guillotine press as it just feels too risky to me, so I\u2019d stick with the banded push up and the banded incline press for higher reps in the 15-20 range to see if you feel them working your upper chest.\n\nStep 4: Fill in further volume with isolation work\n\nI like low to high cable flyes. While dumbbell flyes can be effective for really stretching out the pecs at the bottom, they lose tension at the top. When pulling the cables from low to high, you can mimic the exact orientation of the clavicular fibers, which also run low to high. You might feel this in your front delts (and that\u2019s ok) but if you really focus on the mind-muscle connection and actively squeezing your pecs together, you should feel your upper pecs contracting the most. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\nInstagram \u2023 http://instagram.com/jeffnippard\nFacebook \u2023 http://facebook.com/jeffnippard\nTwitter \u2023 http://twitter.com/jeffnippard\nPodcast \u2023 The Jeff Nippard Podcast on iTunes and Stitcher\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCES:\n\nAlan Aragon's Research Review AARR August 2015 Issue: https://alanaragon.com/aarr/\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/how-to-bench/\nhttps://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:714265\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095407\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20093960\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20512064\n\n\nFilmed and edited by Rashaun R and me using Final Cut Pro X and Sony A7R3\n\nRashaun's YouTube:\n\u2023https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnG0SHgQJm9CcZWIEgRnMw\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

What people mean by \u201ctoning\u201d is basically losing fat so the underlying muscle can show through better. According to the best research we have, losing fat is just a matter of putting yourself in a caloric deficit and eating enough protein. There are at least 3 studies showing that bodyfat spot reduction isn\u2019t possible and a typical weight lifting session only burns about 75-300 calories anyway. Still, I think there is a practical hypertrophy zone somewhere around 6-15 reps.\n\nTraining Myth 2: You should only train one bodypart per workout (Bodypart split)\n\nResearch shows that a full week between workouts is way more time than you need and there might be a \u201climit\u201d to how much you can benefit from killing one muscle in one workout.The \u201cbest\u201d training split is the one that allows you to get an in adequate amount of volume per WEEK, while distributing your working sets throughout the week in a way that maximizes performance and recovery.\n\nTraining Myth 3: Need To Get Sore For The Workout To \u201cCount\u201d\n\nSoreness is a result of a novel stimulus, not necessarily an effective stimulus. Soreness CAN be a decent indicator that you actually hit the muscle you were trying to hit. Did you lift more weight this workout than the last workout? Did you do more reps than the previous workout? Did you improve your form in some small way? These metrics are far more valuable than how much your muscles hurt the next day. \n\nTraining Myth 4: Muscle Confusion Is Important: Always Switch Things Up\n\nFor beginners, I recommend the exact opposite approach: you want to keep the core of your training routine exactly the same week to week. You can have some exercises that you\u2019re more flexible with and you can swap those in and out, but aim to at least have 1 or two \u201cmain movements\u201d per day that you stick to, get better at, and get stronger with. \n\nTraining Myth 5: No Pain No Gain! Take Every Set To Failure!\n\nSince taking sets to failure, especially on heavy compound exercises can cause more fatigue, increase injury risk through form breakdown and reduce the volume later in the workout, I generally recommend reserving sets taken to failure for the last set of an isolation exercise, while leaving 1 to 3 reps in the tank for everything else. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\nInstagram \u2023 http://instagram.com/jeffnippard\nFacebook \u2023 http://facebook.com/jeffnippard\nTwitter \u2023 http://twitter.com/jeffnippard\nPodcast \u2023 The Jeff Nippard Podcast on iTunes and Stitcher\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCES:\n\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/\n\nSpot reduction references here:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5552114\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21804427\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17596787\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23222084\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28497942\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779716\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558493\n\n\nFilmed and edited by Rashaun R and me using Final Cut Pro X and Sony A7R3\n\nRashaun's YouTube:\n\u2023https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnG0SHgQJm9CcZWIEgRnMw\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

This back and up technique will also strengthen the pecs more, since it emphasizes horizontal shoulder adduction over shoulder flexion at the toughest points in the press. \n\nData from Dr. Thomas McLaughlin found that while most benchers did correctly bring the bar down and slightly forward in a smooth arc on the descent, only elite level benchers drove the bar back and then up, whereas novice lifters tended to press the bar straight up first, and then slightly back. \n\nPutting this into practice, I\u2019d recommend filming your sets from the side to get a close look at your bar path\u2026 you can use an app like Iron Path or Dartfish to track this easily. If you\u2019re pressing the bar straight up, make a conscious effort to press the bar back first, and then up. This might feel a bit awkward at first. You want to get to a point where it feels natural. I cue this by thinking about pushing the floor away from me while I simultaneously drive the bar back and up off my chest.\n\nStep #2: Grip the Bar Wider\n\nWherever you\u2019re currently gripping the bar, try gradually easing your grip out by about 1 finger\u2019s width every workout over the next few weeks. Most of the world\u2019s top benchers press with a max legal grip width, with the index fingers all the way out to the grip rings, although this may not be comfortable for everyone. \n\nTip #3: Bench Press More Often\n\nThe next step is to simply bench press more frequently. I think that benching 3 times per week will be the sweet spot for most people. For example, running with a set up like this, we would focus on hypertrophy on Day 1 with sets of 8 reps, power on day two with lighter speed work, and then strength work on day 3, with heavy sets of 5.\n\nMonday: Bench 1 x 2 (RPE9), 2 x 8 (RPE7)\nWednesday: Bench 4 x 3 (RPE6) (press the bar explosively off the chest)\nFriday: Pause bench 3 x 5 (2-second pause) (RPE8)\n\nStep 4: Add Heavy Top Sets Before Volume Work \n\nTop sets are a great way to get comfortable with lifting heavy weight on a regular basis which will improve confidence in your ability to lift heavier without frying your recovery. I\u2019d recommending adding one heavy top set somewhere around 90 percent of your 1 rep max for 2 to 3 reps before backing off and doing your main work for that day. You only need to do this once a week, ideally before your lightest lifting day. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\nInstagram \u2023 http://instagram.com/jeffnippard\nFacebook \u2023 http://facebook.com/jeffnippard\nTwitter \u2023 http://twitter.com/jeffnippard\nPodcast \u2023 The Jeff Nippard Podcast on iTunes and Stitcher\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCES:\n\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/how-to-bench/\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/bench-press-bar-path/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26332783\n\nFilmed and edited by Rashaun R and me using Final Cut Pro X and Sony A7R3\n\nRashaun's YouTube:\n\u2023https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnG0SHgQJm9CcZWIEgRnMw\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

This back and up technique will also strengthen the pecs more, since it emphasizes horizontal shoulder adduction over shoulder flexion at the toughest points in the press. \n\nData from Dr. Thomas McLaughlin found that while most benchers did correctly bring the bar down and slightly forward in a smooth arc on the descent, only elite level benchers drove the bar back and then up, whereas novice lifters tended to press the bar straight up first, and then slightly back. \n\nPutting this into practice, I\u2019d recommend filming your sets from the side to get a close look at your bar path\u2026 you can use an app like Iron Path or Dartfish to track this easily. If you\u2019re pressing the bar straight up, make a conscious effort to press the bar back first, and then up. This might feel a bit awkward at first. You want to get to a point where it feels natural. I cue this by thinking about pushing the floor away from me while I simultaneously drive the bar back and up off my chest.\n\nStep #2: Grip the Bar Wider\n\nWherever you\u2019re currently gripping the bar, try gradually easing your grip out by about 1 finger\u2019s width every workout over the next few weeks. Most of the world\u2019s top benchers press with a max legal grip width, with the index fingers all the way out to the grip rings, although this may not be comfortable for everyone. \n\nTip #3: Bench Press More Often\n\nThe next step is to simply bench press more frequently. I think that benching 3 times per week will be the sweet spot for most people. For example, running with a set up like this, we would focus on hypertrophy on Day 1 with sets of 8 reps, power on day two with lighter speed work, and then strength work on day 3, with heavy sets of 5.\n\nMonday: Bench 1 x 2 (RPE9), 2 x 8 (RPE7)\nWednesday: Bench 4 x 3 (RPE6) (press the bar explosively off the chest)\nFriday: Pause bench 3 x 5 (2-second pause) (RPE8)\n\nStep 4: Add Heavy Top Sets Before Volume Work \n\nTop sets are a great way to get comfortable with lifting heavy weight on a regular basis which will improve confidence in your ability to lift heavier without frying your recovery. I\u2019d recommending adding one heavy top set somewhere around 90 percent of your 1 rep max for 2 to 3 reps before backing off and doing your main work for that day. You only need to do this once a week, ideally before your lightest lifting day. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\nInstagram \u2023 http://instagram.com/jeffnippard\nFacebook \u2023 http://facebook.com/jeffnippard\nTwitter \u2023 http://twitter.com/jeffnippard\nPodcast \u2023 The Jeff Nippard Podcast on iTunes and Stitcher\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCES:\n\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/how-to-bench/\nhttps://www.strongerbyscience.com/bench-press-bar-path/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26332783\n\nFilmed and edited by Rashaun R and me using Final Cut Pro X and Sony A7R3\n\nRashaun's YouTube:\n\u2023https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnG0SHgQJm9CcZWIEgRnMw\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

I use it for heavy squats and deadlifts and it is very effective. If you're new to wearing a belt you may find it \"bulky\" at first and it can take some getting used to.\n\nAnother lighter belt option:\nRise Old School Leather Belt: https://rise.ca/collections/lifting-gear/products/old-school-leather-belt?ref=jeff\nSave 10% using discount JEFF\n\u2023 I like this belt because it's very lightweight, easy to carry around and doesn't feel \"bulky\" at all around the waist while still doing its job. This belt isn't designed for high level powerlifters using max weight on squats and deadlifts (a lever belt is better for that - see below) however it is very convenient and effective. I use it mostly for exercises like bent rows, bench presses, shrugs, etc. however will also use it for squats and deadlifts, especially when travelling. If you're new to wearing a belt, this is probably the best place to get started because it is so comfortable. \n\nThe straps I'm using:\nhttps://ca.rise.ca/collections/lifting-gear/products/lifting-straps-military?ref=jeff\nSave 10% using discount JEFF\n\nMY PUSH PULL LEGS PROGRAM:\nhttp://jeffnippard.com/pushpulllegs\n\n-------------------------------\n\nCheck out what my amazing sponsors have to offer:\n\n\u25b9 MASS (Monthly Research Review)\n\u2023 https://bit.ly/jeffMASS\n\u2023 Only $25/month (pre-paid yearly)\n\n\u25b9 PEScience Supplements\n\u2023 https://www.PEScience.com/discount/jeff\n\u2023 Use discount code JEFF to save $$\n\n\u25b9 RISE Training Gear and Sportwear\n\u2023 http://rise.ca/jeff\n\u2023 Use discount code JEFF to save 10%\n\n\u25b9 Body-Analyser Weight and Bodyfat % Scale\n\u2023 https://vitagoods.com/jefffit\n\u2023 Use the above link to save 60% off! \n\n-------------------------------\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\nInstagram \u2023 http://instagram.com/jeffnippard\nFacebook \u2023 http://facebook.com/jeffnippard\nTwitter \u2023 http://twitter.com/jeffnippard\nPodcast \u2023 The Jeff Nippard Podcast on iTunes and Stitcher\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSOURCES:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26252837\nhttps://www.bretcontreras.store/pages/2-x-4-strength\n\nIf you're eager to learn more about proper technique, I recommend subscribing to the 3DMJ Lifting Library:\n\u2023 https://www.3dmjvault.com/courses/lifting-library\n\nFilmed at Body and Soul Gym in Kelowna, BC - my favourite 24 hr gym in the Okanagan!\n\u2023 https://www.bodyandsoulkelowna.com/\n\nIntro Music: \n\u2023 Ryan Little: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFK-mqdEAqE\n\nFilmed and edited by Rashaun R and me using Final Cut Pro X and Sony A7R3\n\nRashaun's YouTube:\n\u2023https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnG0SHgQJm9CcZWIEgRnMw\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAbout me: I'm a Canadian natural pro bodybuilder and internationally-qualified powerlifter with a BSc in biochemistry/chemistry and a passion for science.

Focus on driving elbows down.\n\nChest Supported T Bar Row: 3 sets of 8-10\n  - Double overhand grip, 1.5x shoulder width grip. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the top of each rep using slight momentum to generate explosive squeeze. Controlled eccentric. Use straps if needed to overload. \n\nRope Facepull: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n  - Trap focused facepull = squeeze shoulder bladed together on each rep. Go relatively heavy and position your foot on the cable upright for added support. Think of this movement as a \"high row\" with a rope and pull through your chin.\n\nStanding EZ Bar Curl: 4 sets of 8-10 reps\n  - Focus on keeping elbows back, using moderate cheating on the last 2 reps. Use a variety of grip widths, or whatever feels most comfortable. \n\nMachine Preacher Curl: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n  - Strict form with a controlled tempo. Mind muscle connection with the biceps for all reps. \n\nPlate Loaded Neck Curl: 4 sets of 15-20 reps\n  - Use toque for head support. Minimize involvement of hands/arms. Use full range of motion and slightly faster lifting tempo (1:0:1:0)\n\nKosher Hats/Tees: https://www.kosherapl.com/\n\nGET MASS (Research Review):\n\u2023 http://bit.ly/jeffMASS\n\n-------------------------------\n\nMY SUPPLEMENTS\n\u2023 https://www.PEScience.com\n\u2023 Use discount code JEFF to save 30%\n\nRISE Clothing\n\u2023 https://www.rise.ca\n\u2023 Use discount code JEFF10 to save 10%\n\nMUSIC\n\u2023 BZZY - If You Only Knew ft.

If the shoulder press is a frontal plane movement, why doesn't it \nprimarily target the lateral deltoid?\n\n2. If the front raise is training pure shoulder flexion, why is the front\nraise less effective than a shoulder press at activating the front delts?\n\n3. Does a wide grip or a narrow grip lead to more deltoid activation\nin pressing movements?\n\n4.

If the shoulder press is a frontal plane movement, why doesn't it \nprimarily target the lateral deltoid?\n\n2. If the front raise is training pure shoulder flexion, why is the front\nraise less effective than a shoulder press at activating the front delts?\n\n3. Does a wide grip or a narrow grip lead to more deltoid activation\nin pressing movements?\n\n4. Why was a neutral hand position found to outperform the\npronated hand position for mean rear deltoid EMG activity?\n\n-------------------------------\n\nFOLLOW ME \u25b9\n\nINSTAGRAM \u2023 http://instagram.com/jeffnippard\nSNAPCHAT \u2023 http://snapchat.com/add/jeffnippard\nFACEBOOK \u2023 http://facebook.com/jeffnippard\nTWITTER \u2023 http://twitter.com/jeffnippard\nPODCAST \u2023 IceCream4PRs on iTunes \n\nFOLLOW STEPHANIE ON IG \u25b9 https://www.instagram.com/stephanie_buttermore/\n\nSubscribe to Stephanie on YouTube \u25b9\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4gDYbCEIb69uvFmCX5Lyuw\n\n-------------------------------\n\nREFERENCES:\n\u2023 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23302754\n\nMY SUPPLEMENTS\n\u2023 https://www.PEScience.com\n\u2023 Use discount code JEFF to save 30%\n\nRISE Clothing\n\u2023 https://www.rise.ca\n\u2023 Use discount code JEFF10 to save 10%\n\nRISE Black Align Tank\n\u2023 https://www.rise.ca/collections/men-tank-tops/products/align-tank-black\n\u2023 Use discount code JEFF10 to save 10%\n\nMUSIC\n\u2023 https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday\n\u2023 https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\nSpecial thank you to my new research assistant!\n\u2023 Welcome to the team, Max Edsey!\n\n-------------------------------\n\nMY HEIGHT \u25b9\nI'm 5'5\n\nI edit all my videos myself using Final Cut Pro X only :)"
