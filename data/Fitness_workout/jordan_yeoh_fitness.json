You can do this routine after your Gym or Running session. Be sure to maintain good form when exercising!\n\nImportant note: This workout routine is not a spot-reduction exercise routine. Perhaps, Spot-reduction is a fitness myth. You can't burn fat in a specific area (belly, triceps, chest, legs) by doing a specifically targeted muscle group exercise. To get the best out of my workout videos, you must commit yourself to workout at least 3 times or more in a week (I still train about 5-6 times a week during the pandemic). Feel free to incorporate your workout with my other training routines from my channel. For the best results, you must take care of your diet. Reduce all sugary and oily food.

Download My Training App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nWarning: This workout routine is not for Beginner and Intermediate trainer. This routine is hardcore, and this workout routine is never meant to be \"fun\" or that kinda \"good workout\" routine, and you may dislike this routine. However, this routine was designed to push your body to the limit or beyond, especially your lower body and stamina!\n\nThree criteria to get the best out of level 6:\n\n1.) Technique: You must be able to complete all Level 5 workouts without feeling too much fatigue. That means that your body is already adapted to this kind of training. \n\n2.) Stamina & Recovery: Complete Level 5 workouts by taking no longer than 2-3 minutes rest in between each round.\n\n3.) To experience Level 6 difficulty. You must achieve the rep goal in every exercise. IMO, if you only manage to achieve anything lower than the benchmark, this workout is considered a Level 5 workout instead.\n\nEstimated calories burned in this session: 500-600+ kcal\n(your fitness tracker might show different results)\n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nTraining & Coaching App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

Download My Training App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nWarning: This workout routine is not for Beginner and Intermediate trainer. This routine is hardcore, and this workout routine is never meant to be \"fun\" or that kinda \"good workout\" routine, and you may dislike this routine. However, this routine was designed to push your body to the limit or beyond, especially your lower body and stamina!\n\nThree criteria to get the best out of level 6:\n\n1.) Technique: You must be able to complete all Level 5 workouts without feeling too much fatigue. That means that your body is already adapted to this kind of training. \n\n2.) Stamina & Recovery: Complete Level 5 workouts by taking no longer than 2-3 minutes rest in between each round.\n\n3.) To experience Level 6 difficulty. You must achieve the rep goal in every exercise. IMO, if you only manage to achieve anything lower than the benchmark, this workout is considered a Level 5 workout instead.\n\nEstimated calories burned in this session: 500-600+ kcal\n(your fitness tracker might show different results)\n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nTraining & Coaching App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

I called this \"Fat burning Abs exercise\" is because these ab movements have a great cardio element in it, in other words, they will help you to burn more calories than any standard ab exercise. \n\nDoing these exercises alone won't help you to get rid of your belly fat. Getting a defined six-pack ab is all about getting down to a low body fat level + a certain level of muscularity (your abdominal muscles). This routine only works if you train and eat right consistently (frequently up to 5 times a week), make sure you train every other body part with other bodyweight exercises or weights training. \n\nThe best and fastest way to achieve a defined six-pack ab is the combination with your diet, your day to day food routine. Cut down junk foods, and start eating more real/whole/healthy foods. It's not going to be easy and it's going to take some time. Be patient, and keep up the effort, and you will get there someday I promise. ;)\n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nPersonal Training App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

Getting a defined six-pack ab is all about getting down to a low body fat level + a certain level of muscularity (your abdominal muscles). This routine only works if you train and eat right consistently (frequently up to 5 times a week), make sure you train every other body part with other bodyweight exercises or weights training. \n\nThe best and fastest way to achieve a defined six-pack ab is the combination with your diet, your day to day food routine. Cut down junk foods, and start eating more real/whole/healthy foods. It's not going to be easy and it's going to take some time. Be patient, and keep up the effort, and you will get there someday I promise. ;)\n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nPersonal Training App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

This video is just a demo, specially made for those who can't go to the gym or do not have any gym equipment at home. Are these exercises still useful? Absolutely yes! Speaking about Muscle Hypertrophy, IMO bodyweight it is still not as great when you can overload your muscles with weights like heavy Dumbbells and Barbells. Well, bodyweights at home might not be the best for growth but hey, done is better than none. Get it done!

This video is just a demo, specially made for those who can't go to the gym or do not have any gym equipment at home. Are these exercises still useful? Absolutely yes! Speaking about Muscle Hypertrophy, IMO bodyweight it is still not as great when you can overload your muscles with weights like heavy Dumbbells and Barbells. Well, bodyweights at home might not be the best for growth but hey, done is better than none. Get it done!

Perhaps, Spot-reduction is a fitness myth. You can't burn fat in a specific area (belly, triceps, chest, legs) by doing a specifically targeted muscle group exercise. However, the title of this video \"Fat Burning Abs Workout\", is a couple of different abdominal exercises in a circuit form, added active rest that keeps your heart rate firing at a higher rate throughout the entire 4 minutes of this workout. Therefore, you will burn more calories/fat with this type of workout routine. Of course, the fitter you are the more rounds you can go = more calorie burn.\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nAs with any exercise program, if at any point during your workout you begin to feel faint, dizzy, or have physical discomfort, you should stop immediately and consult a physician.\n\n#fitness #workout #weightloss",

Be sure to maintain a good form when exercising! Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nTo get the best out of my workout videos, you must commit yourself to workout at least 3 times or more in a week (I still train about 5-6 times a week during this outbreak). Feel free to incorporate your workout with my other training routines from my channel, choose what works best for you! \n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nTraining & Coaching App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nThis workout routine is not a spot-reduction exercise routine. Perhaps, Spot-reduction is a fitness myth. You can't burn fat in a specific area (belly, triceps, chest, legs) by doing a specifically targeted muscle group exercise. However, the title of this video \"Fat Burning Abs Workout\", is a couple of different abdominal exercises in a circuit form, added active rest that keeps your heart rate firing at a higher rate throughout the entire 4 minutes of this workout. Therefore, you will burn more calories/fat with this type of workout routine. Of course, the fitter you are the more rounds you can go = more calorie burn.\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nAs with any exercise program, if at any point during your workout you begin to feel faint, dizzy, or have physical discomfort, you should stop immediately and consult a physician.\n\n#fitness #workout #weightloss"

Select 5 out of 40 and do them in a circuit format is good enough! Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nNote: This is not a spot-reduction video. Doing these exercises alone won't help you to get rid of your belly fat. Getting a defined six-pack ab is all about getting down to a low body fat level + a certain level of muscularity (your abdominal muscles). This routine only works if you train and eat right consistently (frequently up to 5 times a week), make sure you train every other body part with other bodyweight exercises or weights training. \n\nThe best and fastest way to achieve a defined six-pack ab is the combination with your diet, your day to day food routine. Cut down junk foods, and start eating more real/whole/healthy foods. It's not going to be easy and it's going to take some time. Be patient, and keep up the effort, and you will get there someday I promise. ;)\n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nTraining & Coaching App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

                    "description": "40 types of variations to train your Abs & Core stability. You don't have to do all 40 of them in one session. Select 5 out of 40 and do them in a circuit format is good enough! Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nNote: This is not a spot-reduction video. Doing these exercises alone won't help you to get rid of your belly fat. Getting a defined six-pack ab is all about getting down to a low body fat level + a certain level of muscularity (your abdominal muscles). This routine only works if you train and eat right consistently (frequently up to 5 times a week), make sure you train every other body part with other bodyweight exercises or weights training. \n\nThe best and fastest way to achieve a defined six-pack ab is the combination with your diet, your day to day food routine. Cut down junk foods, and start eating more real/whole/healthy foods. It's not going to be easy and it's going to take some time. Be patient, and keep up the effort, and you will get there someday I promise. ;)\n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nTraining & Coaching App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

I called this \"One exercise for the Abs\" is because this exercise fires up the entire abs and core, and it has a great cardio element in it. Doing this exercise alone is not sufficient enough to get rid of your belly fat. Getting a defined six-pack ab is all about getting down to a low body fat level + a certain level of muscularity (your abdominal muscles). This routine only works if you train and eat right consistently (frequently up to 5 times a week), make sure you train every other body part with other bodyweight exercises or weights training. \n\nThe best and fastest way to achieve a defined six-pack ab is the combination with your diet, your day to day food routine. Cut down junk foods, and start eating more real/whole/healthy foods. It's not going to be easy and it's going to take some time. Be patient, and keep up the effort, and you will get there someday I promise. ;)\n\nThe exercise and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nAs with any exercise program, if at any point during your workout you begin to feel faint, dizzy, or have physical discomfort, you should stop immediately and consult a physician.\n\n#fitness #workout #weightloss",

Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nTip: This workout gets harder and harder every minute. The first 8 minutes is a piece of cake, but don't underestimate this session, because 10 minutes onwards this workout is going make you sweat and burn calories like mad.

Getting a defined six-pack ab is all about getting down to a low body fat level + a certain level of muscularity (your abdominal muscles).

Are these exercises still useful? In general, absolutely yes (and I'm doing them now for almost a month). Facts, Speaking about Muscle Hypertrophy, imo it is still better to train with Dumbbells and Barbells. Bodyweight at home might not be the best for growth but hey, done is better than none.

I did not achieve this physique by doing these exercises alone. This video is just a demo, specially made for those who can't go to the gym or do not have any gym equipment at home. Are these exercises still useful? In general, absolutely yes (and I'm doing them now for almost a month). Facts, Speaking about Muscle Hypertrophy, imo it is still better to train with Dumbbells and Barbells. Bodyweight at home might not be the best for growth but hey, done is better than none.

But due to high demand from my subscribers. I've decided to share some tips & tricks on how you can maximize your Arms home! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nPhysique Disclaimer: I did not achieve this physique by doing these exercises alone. This video is just a demo, specially made for those who can't go to the gym or do not have any gym equipment at home. Are these exercises still useful? In general, absolutely yes (but not until the level like a bodybuilder). Speaking about Muscle Hypertrophy, imo it is still nowhere close to training with real weights (Dumbbells and Barbells). Bodyweight at home might not be the best for growth but hey, done is better than none. Get it done first!

Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nThis routine will not only burn stubborn fat but it will also improve your fitness level and muscular endurance. This workout is doable for strong-beginner, all you need to do is follow the modification.\n\nWarming up your body before training is crucial. I would recommend everyone to spend at least 5-10 minutes doing some dynamic warm-up on light to moderate intensity.\n\nI would personally go through 1 round of this exercise routine with slow-moderate effort before I start pushing myself hard. As a warm-up, you can do Round 1 with a slow-moderate pace before you start your actual working pace.\n\nEstimated calories burned in this session: 350-500+ kcal\n(your fitness tracker might show different results)\n\n\u25b7Follow Me On\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nTraining & Coaching App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purposes only and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nThis workout routine is suitable for both Men and Women. It can be done by every healthy individual, doesn't really matter if you are fit or unfit.\n\nLadies, don't worry about the added resistance, they will NEVER make you HUGE/MUSCULAR! Resistance will shapes you! And guys will enjoy benefits of lean muscle development (because man have higher testosterone level). \n\nDon't just watch, do this with me! Best experience if you have a Smart/Android TV at home. If not, doing in front of your mobile or PC desktop is all good as long as you MOVE YOUR BODY! \n\nFor best results, go for 3-5 rounds and combine with a proper nutrition regime.

More details about fasting tips below (read more).\n\nQuestion 1: \nWhen is the Best Time to workout?\n\nAnswers: \nThe most convenient time to train is right before you break-fast. This allows you to train and break-fast at ease for ultimate replenish from hydration and nutrition. The down side? Lack of energy and dehydration, but this feeling will go away right after a few days of practice. You gotta persist the first week!  \n\nThe other timing that works great is to train 1-2 hours after you had your first break-fast meal. Having some fluid and nutrient in your system will definitely help you to train hard like normal. But the downside of this timing is training at this timing can be a little late during the day, and some may experience sluggishness due to their consumed meal, due to this I would recommend keeping your pre-workout meal small and eat something that is easy to digest.\n\nQuestion 2: \nHow many times you should workout in a week?\n\nAnswers: \nImo, try to maintain training 3 sessions a week (or more). Frequency allows your body to get adapted to the fasting state faster, and training frequently will will help you maximize fatloss & muscle maintenance (depending of what type of training you do).\n\nFor the first week, you can start easy like working out 2-3 times a week. A week later you may want to increase the frequency to 3-4 times a week, and slowly work up to 5 training sessions in a week.\n\nQuestion 3: \nHow long should you workout?\n\nAnswers: \nIf you are training frequent (up to 5 sessions a week), your workout session doesn't need to be long. Once again, it is depending on what type of training you do and the timing you decided to train. You should keep your workout shorter if you decided to train before break-fast. Where training after your pre-workout meal, you can stick to the same training duration.\n\nImo, 15-30 minutes for bodyweight/running/hard-cardio is good. 30-60 minute for gym training is sufficient.\n\nQuestion 4: \nWhat is the best food to focus during fasting?\n\nAnswers: \nProtein, Protein, Protein! (Red meat will work better)\n\nI would also recommend adding some healthy fats to your diet such as olive, avocado, egg yellow, cheese, coconut oil, and fish oil. This will prolong the nutrient delivery to your system to stay anabolic.\n\nQuestion 5: \nWhat food to avoid?\n\nAnswers: \nReduce/Avoid anything that makes your thirsty and dehydrated. Such as Caffeine, Salt, and Spicy food.\n\nIf you are new to supplement, consuming Whey and Creatine at this time is not a good idea too. But if you've been taking them all this while, it is fine.\n\nIf you want to learn more about my secrets, training with the right method to reduce all the time wasted by figuring out your own in the gym, or get overwhelmed with thousands of different facts on the internet. I strongly recommend you to check out my best coaching program (pocket trainer) link: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nHere you will learn all the exercises that will 100% work with the Muscles you want to build. Not only that, but it also comes with a proven effective training program (feat. Ripped & Fit / Super Training) designed according to your personal training level. All periodized accordingly to help you build muscle and burn fat more aggressive like never before.\n\nLastly, because time is more valuable than money. And I don't want you to go through the long hard-way of learning to get results just like what I did back then. Over here, we did all the heavy lifting for you and all you need to do is just launch the app, tap, and crush your workout! Yup, is that simple. The best time to start is not tomorrow, is not after Ramadan.

Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nImportant note:  Warming up before training is important. I would recommend everyone to spend at least 5-10 minutes doing some dynamic warm up on light to moderate intensity. I would personally go through 1 round of any of this routine with slow and easy effort before I officially start pushing myself harder in the first round onwards. After each round.

Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nHere presenting to you one of my favorite basic exercises to burn fat anytime anywhere. Looks easy to some, but I challenge you to do it and you will feel burn. \n\nWarming up your body before going all-out is crucial. \n\nI would recommend everyone to spend at least 5-10 minutes doing some dynamic warm up on light to moderate intensity.\n\nI would personally go through 1 round of this exercise routine with moderate effort before I start pushing myself hard. Going through the Round 1 format with easy-moderate effort before you starts your actual working set can be a good way to get ready too.\n\nAfter each round. Pause the video take 1-2 minutes break. Depending on how fit you are, somehow it gonna hurt... but hey, it's only 10 mins! and the pain that you feel is what keeping the stubborn fat screaming! Right? ;)\n\nImportant note: Unfortunately, there is no Beginner modification in this workout. This routine are made for Intermediate-Advanced, or anyone who likes to undergo something a little more challenging from my workouts. \n\nHowever, if you are a fresh Beginner but you really, really want to do this workout. Then, I would recommend you to stick to the Round 1 format, if you felt OK... You might be able to do the Round 2-3 version, who knows? ;)\n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nTraining & Coaching App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nBGM 1: The Pure and The Tainted (inst)\nArtist: Blue Stahli\n\nBGM 2: Throw Down Explicit\nArtist: Black Object\n\nBGM 3: Kill Me Every Time (inst)\nArtist: Blue Stahli\n\n(Music used with permission from Position Music and Freedom!\nhttp://sync.positionmusic.com/)\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purpose only, and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

                    "description": "This is a bad@ss fat burning workout! Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nHere presenting to you one of my favorite basic exercises to burn fat anytime anywhere. Looks easy to some, but I challenge you to do it and you will feel burn. \n\nWarming up your body before going all-out is crucial. \n\nI would recommend everyone to spend at least 5-10 minutes doing some dynamic warm up on light to moderate intensity.\n\nI would personally go through 1 round of this exercise routine with moderate effort before I start pushing myself hard. Going through the Round 1 format with easy-moderate effort before you starts your actual working set can be a good way to get ready too.\n\nAfter each round. Pause the video take 1-2 minutes break. Depending on how fit you are, somehow it gonna hurt... but hey, it's only 10 mins! and the pain that you feel is what keeping the stubborn fat screaming! Right? ;)\n\nImportant note: Unfortunately, there is no Beginner modification in this workout. This routine are made for Intermediate-Advanced, or anyone who likes to undergo something a little more challenging from my workouts. \n\nHowever, if you are a fresh Beginner but you really, really want to do this workout. Then, I would recommend you to stick to the Round 1 format, if you felt OK... You might be able to do the Round 2-3 version, who knows? ;)\n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nTraining & Coaching App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nBGM 1: The Pure and The Tainted (inst)\nArtist: Blue Stahli\n\nBGM 2: Throw Down Explicit\nArtist: Black Object\n\nBGM 3: Kill Me Every Time (inst)\nArtist: Blue Stahli\n\n(Music used with permission from Position Music and Freedom!\nhttp://sync.positionmusic.com/)\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purpose only, and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

You will feel the burn! :)\n\nWarming up your body before going all-out is crucial. \n\nI would recommend everyone to spend at least 5-10 minutes doing some dynamic warm up on light to moderate intensity. I would personally go through 1 round of this exercise routine with moderate effort before I start pushing myself hard. Doing the beginner modification routine for 1 round before your actual working set can be a good way to get ready too.\n\nAfter each round. Pause the video take 2 minutes rest.

                    "description": "A full 9 minutes progressive body weight routine that can be done anywhere anytime. Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp \n\nImportant note: Beginner modification is only for Beginner who just started exercising. If you are not, you should be doing my version and try to keep up with my pace... You will feel the burn! :)\n\nWarming up your body before going all-out is crucial. \n\nI would recommend everyone to spend at least 5-10 minutes doing some dynamic warm up on light to moderate intensity. I would personally go through 1 round of this exercise routine with moderate effort before I start pushing myself hard. Doing the beginner modification routine for 1 round before your actual working set can be a good way to get ready too.\n\nAfter each round. Pause the video take 2 minutes rest. It's gonna be hard, I know... but hey, this is what melt away the fat like crazy and a build a fitter stronger you!\n\nAl the best! ;)\n\n\u25b7Connect with Me\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordanyeohfitness\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/jordanyeohfitness\nTraining & Coaching App: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nMusic 1: Shoot Em Up Instrumental by Blue Stahli\nMusic 2: Ultranumb Instrumental by Blue Stahli\nMusic 3: Scrape Instrumental by Blue Stahli\n\n(Music used with permission from Position Music and Freedom!\nhttp://sync.positionmusic.com/)\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe exercises and workouts provided in this video are for educational purpose only, and are not to be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, or course of action. \n\nBefore beginning this or any exercise program, please consult a physician for appropriate exercise prescription and safety precautions. \n\nThe exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation.

Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nThis workout can be done anywhere anytime, and it won't take much of your time (this will take about like 20-30mins of your day and it's like only 2% of your 24 hours!). No excuses!\n\nDo 1 round and you'll starting sweating. \nDo 2-3 rounds and you'll start burning fats! \n\nIf you do 4-5 rounds or more, that's really gonna hurt because your melting away that super glue alike stubborn fats that just don't go away! \n\nTo get the best out my workout videos, you must commit yourself to workout at least 3 times or more in a week (I personally workout about 5-6 times a week). Feel free to incorporate your workout with my other training routines from my channel, choose what work best for you! \n\nUltimately, if control your diet most of the days every week, overtime YOU WILL GET A NICE TONED BODY (or six pack abs!).

Get my App here: https://bit.ly/trainwithjordanapp\n\nThis workout routine is suitable for both Men and Women. It can be done by every healthy individual, doesn't really matter if you are fit or unfit.\n\nLadies, don't worry about the added resistance, they will NEVER make you HUGE/MUSCULAR! Resistance will shapes you! And guys will enjoy benefits of lean muscle development (because man have higher testosterone level). \n\nDon't just watch, do this with me!

I 100% agree with that statement, but that doesn't mean that you should totally neglect your Abs muscles.\n\nImo, training Abs can improve your mind muscle connection. For fitness model it is very important to train Abs not because the more you train the better bigger they became, but to improve your muscular endurance of continuously contracting your Abs when on stage or during a photo-shooting session to show your all hard earned kitchen and training efforts!\n\nI've seen many people with low body fat level but they still have trouble presenting their beautiful six packs abs, Abs indeed is there, but they can't contract their packs to make it look protrude, and they have problem flexing their Abs for long and later on it doesn't appear solid. The solution? Train your Abs! \n\nLow body fat gives you Abs. \nLow body fat + training gives you great Abs!\n\n#fitness #workout #weightloss",

I 100% agree with that statement, but that doesn't mean that you should totally neglect your Abs muscles.\n\nImo, training Abs can improve your mind muscle connection. For fitness model it is very important to train Abs not because the more you train the better bigger they became, but to improve your muscular endurance of continuously contracting your Abs when on stage or during a photo-shooting session to show your all hard earned kitchen and training efforts!\n\nI've seen many people with low body fat level but they still have trouble presenting their beautiful six packs abs, Abs indeed is there, but they can't contract their packs to make it look protrude, and they have problem flexing their Abs for long and later on it doesn't appear solid. The solution? Train your Abs! \n\nLow body fat gives you Abs. \nLow body fat + training gives you great Abs!\n\n#fitness #workout #weightloss"
