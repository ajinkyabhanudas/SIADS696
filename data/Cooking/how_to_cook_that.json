This week we are debunking fake cooking videos, milk tea jelly, changers of cooking in a toaster and warning you not to do fractal wood burning or Lichtenburg wood burning.  If you're searching for a video on how to do fractal wood burning or how to make a fractal wood burning machine then I do hope you find this video first.  It might just save your life.  Join me for creative cakes, chocolate, desserts & debunking new video every Friday.   \n\nSubscribe on email: http://bit.ly/H2CTemail\nSUBSCRIBE on youtube: http://bit.ly/H2CThat  \n\nRecipe details: http://www.howtocookthat.net\n\nYoutube Channel: http://youtube.com/howtocookthat\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/howtocookthat\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/howtocookthat\n\nFeel like binge watching?

Today I attempt to follow a Bob Ross tutorial using chocolate ganache on a cake.  100% edible, yummy chocolate cake with orange syrup, butter cream, white chocolate ganache.  Bob Ross did many, many seasons on TV, showing tutorial on how to paint quick, impressive landscapes using oil paint.  Today there is no paint in sight, just chocolate ganache and hot cream to wash the brushes.

In this video we will make bride cake, macaroons, Naples biscuits and of course cafe foot jelly to culminate in a grand trifle the likes of which you've never seen before.
