The Times published the recipe in the newspaper every September from 1983 until 1989, which the editors determined would be the last year they printed it. They received lots of angry letters from readers as a result. If you\u2019d like to try it, fear not, you can access the recipe right here: https://nyti.ms/3cNfC98.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2MrEFxh\r\n\r\nINSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/2DqJMuD\r\nFACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/2MrTjEC\r\nTWITTER: http://bit.ly/2RZB6ng\r\nPINTEREST: http://bit.ly/2W44xng\r\n\r\nAbout NYT Cooking:\r\nAll the food that\u2019s fit to eat (yes, it\u2019s an official New York Times production)."

This simple, four-ingredient version combines the meringue with Oreos and tops it with swoopy salted whipped cream.

The story goes that Pavlova, a dessert which both Australia and New Zealand lay claim to, is named after the ballerina Anna Pavlova, because it resembles her tutu. This simple, four-ingredient version combines the meringue with Oreos and tops it with swoopy salted whipped cream. Fans of the marshmallows in Lucky Charms cereal are gonna love this one.\n\nGet the recipe: https://nyti.ms/3OSEVop\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2MrEFxh\r\n\r\nINSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/2DqJMuD\r\nFACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/2MrTjEC\r\nTWITTER: http://bit.ly/2RZB6ng\r\nPINTEREST: http://bit.ly/2W44xng\r\n\r\nAbout NYT Cooking:\r\nAll the food that\u2019s fit to eat (yes, it\u2019s an official New York Times production)."

First up, Kimchi Grilled Cheese, because kimchi\u2019s spicy heat plays well with melty mozzarella.

And last, but not least, Mozzarella in Carrozza, which are like mozzarella sticks in sandwich form. Which are you making first?

Ali Slagle is in the studio kitchen to show us how! In her fast and satisfying One-Pot Broccoli Mac and Cheese, everything is added all together in a large pot right from the get-go: The noodles are cooked in milk, which thickens to the consistency of cream, and the broccoli gets soft and sweet as it\u2019s coated with gooey cheese.\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2MrEFxh\r\n\r\nINSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/2DqJMuD\r\nFACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/2MrTjEC\r\nTWITTER: http://bit.ly/2RZB6ng\r\nPINTEREST: http://bit.ly/2W44xng\r\n\r\nAbout NYT Cooking:\r\nAll the food that\u2019s fit to eat (yes, it\u2019s an official New York Times production)."

She\u2019s in the studio kitchen showing us how to make her Extra-Lemony Meringue Pie, which is a tangier, creamier version of its cousin, Lemon Meringue Pie. In Melissa\u2019s recipe, a buttery lemon curd is topped with swirls of lemon zest-infused meringue. \u201cFor a lemon meringue pie,\u201d Melissa says, \u201cthe focus really should be on the contrast between that tangy filling and then that fluffy, sweet topping.

For Caramelized Plantains With Beans, Scallions and Lemon, ripe yellow plantains spotted with large black dots are best because they\u2019re softer and sweeter.

Inspired by the flavors of French onion soup, Sue's recipe features a galette dough run through with Gruy\u00e8re and lots of fragrant cracked black pepper, and a caramelized onion filling fortified with beef broth and sherry. While the onions caramelize, Sue likes to check Zillow and stock prices. But what you decide to do with that time is your call. \n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2MrEFxh\r\n\r\nINSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/2DqJMuD\r\nFACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/2MrTjEC\r\nTWITTER: http://bit.ly/2RZB6ng\r\nPINTEREST: http://bit.ly/2W44xng\r\n\r\nAbout NYT Cooking:\r\nAll the food that\u2019s fit to eat (yes, it\u2019s an official New York Times production)."

They have a flaky, cream cheese-spiked crust that makes them a little like soft, tiny pastries. This version calls for cherry preserves and some optional walnuts, but you can use any flavor of jam (or nut if you\u2019re so inclined) you like. Apricot and raspberry jam are the most traditional. \n\nStay tuned as Cookie Week continues on our channel with videos from Claire Saffitz, Yewande Komolafe, Sohla El-Waylly and more.\n\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2MrEFxh\r\n\r\nINSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/2DqJMuD\r\nFACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/2MrTjEC\r\nTWITTER: http://bit.ly/2RZB6ng\r\nPINTEREST: http://bit.ly/2W44xng\r\n\r\nAbout NYT Cooking:\r\nAll the food that\u2019s fit to eat (yes, it\u2019s an official New York Times production)."

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Boil the potatoes in a medium pot of unsalted water until they\u2019re soft, 25 to 30 minutes. You should be able to easily stick a fork in them. Once they\u2019re done, peel the potato skins with a knife and put the skinned potatoes in a 9-by-5-inch casserole dish.  \n\n2. To the dish, add condensed milk, sugar, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Using a hand mixer on low speed, start to blend the potatoes. Once they break down a little, turn the mixer to high and mix until creamy. Once smooth, give the sweet potatoes a taste. Our family always adds a second round of the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice), so add spices to your taste.\n\n3. Add 1/2 cup each pecans and marshmallows, and blend them in with a spoon. Once they are mixed in, smooth the top with the spoon and clean off any sweet potato on the edges of the casserole dish.\n\n4. Cover the top of the casserole with remaining marshmallows, and sprinkle the rest of the pecans on top.

Follow along as he teaches us how to make three homemade condiments to take your hot dog game to a new level. \n\nFirst up: Pickled Beer Mustard (0:37), because why buy mustard when you can make your own at home? Then there\u2019s Cucumber and Sweet Pepper Relish (2:02), which adds texture and crunch. And last, but not least, a rich and cheesy Mornay Sauce (3:04).\n\nRecipes:\n\nPickled Beer Mustard\n3 tablespoons kosher salt \n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n3/4 cup champagne vinegar\n1 cup light beer \n1/2 cup water\n1/2 cup mustard seeds \n1/4 cup grapeseed oil \n2 tablespoons mustard powder\n\n1. Add vinegar, sugar, salt and water to a medium saucepan. Turn heat to medium and bring to a boil. Make sure to whisk occasionally. \n\n2. Once your ingredients are dissolved, add mustard seeds and let them cook for 5 minutes. Turn your heat down to a medium-low, then add beer. (Please note, it is important not to let the liquid fully boil at this point because the beer will get bitter). Keep your mixture at a soft simmer for 25 minutes.\n\n3. At the 25 minute mark, turn heat off, then cover and let seeds cool down in the liquid for 15 minutes. \n\n4. Reserve a 1/2 cup of the liquid, and strain seeds. Place seeds and the reserved liquid into a blender and pulse until smooth. Slowly, incorporate grapeseed oil and 1/2 cup of water into the blender to help you achieve a smooth consistency.\n \n \nSweet Pepper and Cucumber Relish \n2 sweet peppers or bell peppers\n2 Kirby cucumbers\n1 cup champagne vinegar\n1/2 cup rice wine\n1/2 cup water\n2 tablespoons kosher salt \n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n\n1. Cut cucumber and pepper into a small dice and place in a medium bowl. \n \n2. Combine all remaining ingredients (champagne vinegar, rice wine, water, salt and sugar) in a medium saucepan. Turn heat to medium and bring to a boil. Occasionally whisk so your ingredients are fully incorporated and dissolved.\n \n3. Once the liquid has come to a boil, pour the hot liquid over the cucumber and pepper mixture and cover the bowl for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, place your bowl in a larger \nice bath bowl for 15 minutes or until the mixture has fully cooled for serving. Enjoy on your favorite hot dog, sausage or sandwich!\n\n\nMornay Cheese Sauce\n1 cup milk\n1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\nKosher salt\n1/2 cup sharp Cheddar \n\n1. Place a medium saucepan on your stove. Turn heat to low and add butter. \n \n2. Once butter is melted, add flour and fully whisk the two together. Let the mixture cook for 5 minutes. The mixture will start to smell nutty. \n \n3. Add in milk and whisk until fully incorporated. Then, proceed by adding the cheese. Once your cheese is fully melted, pass the liquid through a strainer for a smooth consistency. If you find that the consistency is a little thick, you can always add a couple of tablespoons of milk to thin it out to your liking. Season with salt to taste.

This Tomato-Poached Fish with Chile Oil and Herbs is the perfect way to get started. It poaches in a flavorful sauce of burst cherry tomatoes, shallots and garlic. It has a strong summer vibe, but if tomatoes aren't in season, canned will do just fine. \n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2MrEFxh\n\nINSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/2DqJMuD\nFACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/2MrTjEC\nTWITTER: http://bit.ly/2RZB6ng\nPINTEREST: http://bit.ly/2W44xng\n\nAbout NYT Cooking:\nAll the food that\u2019s fit to eat (yes, it\u2019s an official New York Times production)."

                "description": "Salt & Straw is a popular ice cream chain that started in Portland, Oregon. It's known for innovative flavors and high-quality. Tyler Malek, head ice cream maker and co-founder, shows you how to make the perfect ice cream \u2013 just in time for summer. Get the full recipe below. More on Salt & Straw here: https://saltandstraw.com\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nCHOCOLATE GOOEY BROWNIE ICE CREAM\n\nFOR THE ICE CREAM BASE:\n1 1/3 cups whole milk\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons light corn syrup\n2 tablespoons dry milk powder\n1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum\n1 1/3 cups heavy cream\n\nFOR THE BROWNIES:\n1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 1-inch chunks\n3/4 cup/130 grams chocolate chips (5 ounces)\n2 large eggs\n3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar\n1/2 cup/65 grams all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup/25 grams unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-processed\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream\n1 cup/240 milliliters Marshmallow Fluff\n\nFOR THE CHOCOLATE FLAVOR:\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n1. Prepare the base: Combine the milk, sugar, corn syrup, dry milk and xanthan gum in a medium pot and stir to combine. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring often until the sugar has dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\n2. Add the cream and whisk until fully combined. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate until chilled. (For best flavor, chill for about 12 hours.) The base can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. If frozen, be sure to thaw fully before using.\n\n3. As ice cream chills, prepare the brownies: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9x9-inch baking dish with parchment paper and coat with nonstick spray.\n\n4. Assemble a double boiler by placing a small saucepan filled with an inch of water over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Place the butter and chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and set it on top of the saucepan (make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water). Reduce heat to low, and stir the butter and chocolate until fully melted together. Remove the double boiler from heat and set aside.\n\n5. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with an electric hand mixer, beat the eggs and sugar until light and frothy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and stream in the chocolate mixture. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until well combined.\n\n6. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder and salt. Add the flour mixture to the chocolate mixture and mix on low until just combined. With the mixer running, drizzle in the heavy cream and mix until just combined, scraping down the sides as necessary. Fold the Marshmallow Fluff into the batter with a spatula or large spoon, mixing just enough to get most of it incorporated with a few streaks remaining.\n\n7. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer. Bake about 30 minutes, until the top is crackly and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let them cool completely and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Freeze in sealed freezer bags before using; they will keep up to 2 months.\n\n8. Once ice cream base is chilled, mix in the flavoring: Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan, set it over medium heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cocoa powder until it is smooth and glossy. Let cool to room temperature.\n\n9. Pour the chocolate syrup into the chilled ice cream base and whisk to combine. You may want to refrigerate this mixture until cold if your base was not chilled ahead of time, or if using a pre-frozen bowl machine.\n\n10. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn, according to your machine\u2019s instructions, until it has the texture of soft serve.\n\n11. When churned, layer the ice cream and brownies in a freezer-friendly container. Cover with parchment paper and freeze until firm, about 6 hours. The ice cream will keep up to 3 months.\n\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2MrEFxh\n\nINSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/2DqJMuD\nFACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/2MrTjEC\nTWITTER: http://bit.ly/2RZB6ng\nPINTEREST: http://bit.ly/2W44xng\n\nAbout NYT Cooking:\nAll the food that\u2019s fit to eat (yes, it\u2019s an official New York Times production).\n#icecream",

                    "description": "Salt & Straw is a popular ice cream chain that started in Portland, Oregon. It's known for innovative flavors and high-quality. Tyler Malek, head ice cream maker and co-founder, shows you how to make the perfect ice cream \u2013 just in time for summer. Get the full recipe below. More on Salt & Straw here: https://saltandstraw.com\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nCHOCOLATE GOOEY BROWNIE ICE CREAM\n\nFOR THE ICE CREAM BASE:\n1 1/3 cups whole milk\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons light corn syrup\n2 tablespoons dry milk powder\n1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum\n1 1/3 cups heavy cream\n\nFOR THE BROWNIES:\n1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 1-inch chunks\n3/4 cup/130 grams chocolate chips (5 ounces)\n2 large eggs\n3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar\n1/2 cup/65 grams all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup/25 grams unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-processed\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream\n1 cup/240 milliliters Marshmallow Fluff\n\nFOR THE CHOCOLATE FLAVOR:\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n1. Prepare the base: Combine the milk, sugar, corn syrup, dry milk and xanthan gum in a medium pot and stir to combine. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring often until the sugar has dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\n2. Add the cream and whisk until fully combined. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate until chilled. (For best flavor, chill for about 12 hours.) The base can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. If frozen, be sure to thaw fully before using.\n\n3. As ice cream chills, prepare the brownies: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9x9-inch baking dish with parchment paper and coat with nonstick spray.\n\n4. Assemble a double boiler by placing a small saucepan filled with an inch of water over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Place the butter and chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and set it on top of the saucepan (make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water). Reduce heat to low, and stir the butter and chocolate until fully melted together. Remove the double boiler from heat and set aside.\n\n5. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with an electric hand mixer, beat the eggs and sugar until light and frothy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and stream in the chocolate mixture. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until well combined.\n\n6. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder and salt. Add the flour mixture to the chocolate mixture and mix on low until just combined. With the mixer running, drizzle in the heavy cream and mix until just combined, scraping down the sides as necessary. Fold the Marshmallow Fluff into the batter with a spatula or large spoon, mixing just enough to get most of it incorporated with a few streaks remaining.\n\n7. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer. Bake about 30 minutes, until the top is crackly and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let them cool completely and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Freeze in sealed freezer bags before using; they will keep up to 2 months.\n\n8. Once ice cream base is chilled, mix in the flavoring: Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan, set it over medium heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cocoa powder until it is smooth and glossy. Let cool to room temperature.\n\n9. Pour the chocolate syrup into the chilled ice cream base and whisk to combine. You may want to refrigerate this mixture until cold if your base was not chilled ahead of time, or if using a pre-frozen bowl machine.\n\n10. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn, according to your machine\u2019s instructions, until it has the texture of soft serve.\n\n11. When churned, layer the ice cream and brownies in a freezer-friendly container. Cover with parchment paper and freeze until firm, about 6 hours. The ice cream will keep up to 3 months.\n\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2MrEFxh\n\nINSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/2DqJMuD\nFACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/2MrTjEC\nTWITTER: http://bit.ly/2RZB6ng\nPINTEREST: http://bit.ly/2W44xng\n\nAbout NYT Cooking:\nAll the food that\u2019s fit to eat (yes, it\u2019s an official New York Times production).\n#icecream"
