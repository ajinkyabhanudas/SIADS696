Because if you go in with that expectations you'll end up disappointed. \n\nSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nBook http://yousuckatcooking.com\n\nDanse Morialta by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1200026\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nRECIPE\n1 egg plus 1 egg yolk \n\u00bc cup sugar \nBeat with motorized blendicles for a few minutes until it all gets bigger and fluffier and paler and creamier \n\nAdd half a stick of butter to a double boiler \nAdd 3.5oz/100g chocolate of some sort \nMelt that stuff and wangjangle until smooth and watery \nAlways handle with volcano gloves \n\nSlowly pour the buttery chocolate into the sweet eggs and blendicize until it all looks like chocolate. But it's not just chocolate. It's also the other things. \nAdd in two teaspoons of wheat dust and wangjangle thoroughly \n\nGo back in time and butter and flour your ramekins. Tap out the excess flour but not during a wrestling match, at least not one where there's a lot of money on the line. \n\nSpoon the chocolate sauce into the ramekins \n\nGo back in time again and preheat the undoh to 425undo \n\nPut the ramekins on a baking sheet then slide them in the oven for ten minutes. Make sure to close the oven door after you slide them in, otherwise the oven won't be as hot. \n\nTake the lava cakes out of the oven and let them cool for a minute then flip onto a plate. Once again, use volcano gloves. \n\nSlide the ramekin off and then enjoy that cake. Don't wait or the lava will harden. But blow on it because it's hot. Always exercise caution around geology."

But if you really think I should write it out, give me three reasons why in the comments and I will probably write it out even if you don't.\n\nRECIPE UPDATE\n\nOkay here we go. Get some bread. White bread, green brad, artisan bread, crackers, I don't care. \n\nNow make some b\u00e9chamel sauce. \n1.5 tablespoons of butter on low heat in a sauce pan \n1.5 tablespoons of flour whiskjangled slowly into the same pan until it's smooth and bubbly for a couple minutes\nSlowly add a cup of milk and go through the 5 Stages of B\u00e9chamel Hell. \nI hear if you warm the milk up it works better but who has time for that? Not you. You're already warming the milk up anyway \nAdd some salt, pepper, and nutmeg...don't go buck wild with the nutmeg or you'll get all nutted out \nCook it until it's a bit thick then take it off the heat\nSURPRISE you made way too much b\u00e9chamel for one sandwich \nBread\nb\u00e9chamel \nGrated gruyere \nham \nGrated gruyere \nb\u00e9chamel on the bread ceiling \nBread \nb\u00e9chamel on the bread roof\nGrated gruyere \n\nBut like flip that list upside down if you want it to correspond to gravity. \nAlso many recipes have one less layer of b\u00e9chamel but we didn't come here to fuck around \nPut in in the undoh for a few minutes or just put it straight on broil for a couple minutes. \nDon't take your eye off it when it's on broil! If you go on your phone for even one second the sandwich will be burnt to a crisp",

But if you really think I should write it out, give me three reasons why in the comments and I will probably write it out even if you don't.\n\nRECIPE UPDATE\n\nOkay here we go. Get some bread. White bread, green brad, artisan bread, crackers, I don't care. \n\nNow make some b\u00e9chamel sauce. \n1.5 tablespoons of butter on low heat in a sauce pan \n1.5 tablespoons of flour whiskjangled slowly into the same pan until it's smooth and bubbly for a couple minutes\nSlowly add a cup of milk and go through the 5 Stages of B\u00e9chamel Hell. \nI hear if you warm the milk up it works better but who has time for that? Not you. You're already warming the milk up anyway \nAdd some salt, pepper, and nutmeg...don't go buck wild with the nutmeg or you'll get all nutted out \nCook it until it's a bit thick then take it off the heat\nSURPRISE you made way too much b\u00e9chamel for one sandwich \nBread\nb\u00e9chamel \nGrated gruyere \nham \nGrated gruyere \nb\u00e9chamel on the bread ceiling \nBread \nb\u00e9chamel on the bread roof\nGrated gruyere \n\nBut like flip that list upside down if you want it to correspond to gravity. \nAlso many recipes have one less layer of b\u00e9chamel but we didn't come here to fuck around \nPut in in the undoh for a few minutes or just put it straight on broil for a couple minutes. \nDon't take your eye off it when it's on broil! If you go on your phone for even one second the sandwich will be burnt to a crisp"

A hot pot full of oil is super dangerous. You can deep fry safely but you have to know what you're doing. The first time I tried it, I was dipping my meat thermometer in the oil to keep track of the temperature. This was colossally stupid. You need a dedicated thermometer on your pot so you can watch constantly and so you won't drop it inside. Better yet, a dedicated deep fryer is really the way to go, and you can just read the instruction manual. Long story short, if your oil temperature gets out of control a fire can start, and you can't put it out with water, you either have to smother it or use a fire extinguisher. Also, the oil takes FOREVER to cool down, so many sure anyone in your house knows not to touch it when you're done using it. It also takes FOREVER to heat up so it's super tempting to turn up the temperature, which is a mistake (on my stovetop, 350 F was just below the number 4. Anyway, read this guide if you think you actually want to try deep frying, and then just order onion rings from the bar instead. \n\nDeep Fry Safety \nhttps://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-deep-fry-safely\n\nRecipe \n\nSlice some onions and make rings\nRemove tape\nYeah basically take any onion you like \nAdd \u00be cup of flour and \u00bc cup corn starch to a bowl \nThen add spices; cayenne, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, whatever. Let's say around a tablespoon total \nAdd around a cup of soda water, more or less, depending on how buck wild you've gone with the spices. One description I read about the thickness is that it should be like thick paint. \n\nHeat 3 or so inches of peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a tall sturdy pot (not non stick)\nPreferably on your back burner so it won't get knocked. If your vessel has handles, make sure they are not sticking out \nI see a lot of people use their fingers to put things into the oil. I don't like this method because that's too close for comfort. The spider strainer, in my opinion, is the best way to go. The chance of dropping something in the oil is very minimal. If you're going to use tongs, grip tightly, and I don't recommend silicon tipped tongs because they are slippery. You REALLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE AN OIIL SPLASH \nSo use your spider strainer to lower an undoh ring into the oil\nAfter a minute or a minute and a half, flip it, then take it out after another minute. Just trust your eyes in terms of how cooked you want it \nI highly recommend setting a timer each time you put a batch in as it's easy to get distracted for one minute and you really have to have your head in the game for as long as you are deep frying \nPlace onion rings on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. If you don't have a wire rack you can place them on paper towels on a plate or in a bowl \nWhen you're all done, move that oil to the back burner if it's not already there (very, very carefully, using oven mitts), and make sure everyone knows not to touch it for a couple hours. Keep your thermometer in there so you know when it's completely cooled\nThen you can either save it or dispose of it. Here's a helpful guide on how to dispose of the oil...long story short, it will end up in the trash, not the sink or toilet \nhttps://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995\n\nThanks! I hope you order onion rings from the bar.",

Just trust your eyes in terms of how cooked you want it \nI highly recommend setting a timer each time you put a batch in as it's easy to get distracted for one minute and you really have to have your head in the game for as long as you are deep frying \nPlace onion rings on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. If you don't have a wire rack you can place them on paper towels on a plate or in a bowl \nWhen you're all done, move that oil to the back burner if it's not already there (very, very carefully, using oven mitts), and make sure everyone knows not to touch it for a couple hours. Keep your thermometer in there so you know when it's completely cooled\nThen you can either save it or dispose of it. Here's a helpful guide on how to dispose of the oil...long story short, it will end up in the trash, not the sink or toilet \nhttps://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995\n\nThanks! I hope you order onion rings from the bar."

While we may never know the ugly truth, we can continue to enjoy this delicious pasta dish one deadly bite at a time. \n\nSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://yousuckatcooking.com\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\n\nRecipe\n.5 parts pasta to \n.25 parts butter to \n.25 parts parmesan \n\nCook the pasta, strengthen your wrists, and then do all the things. \n\nThe original recipe called for parmesan aged 24 months, which is a young parmesan. I used one aged 36 months so it would taste slightly wiser. Don't even both trying to make the original noodles. It's WAY above your pay grade.",

                    "description": "Fettuccine Alfredo, as invented by Alfred Di Lelio in 1908, consists of pasta, butter, and parmesan. While it's said he made it for his wife who wasn't eating after giving birth, the truth is more likely that Mr. Alfredo had a cheese and butter addiction. While we may never know the ugly truth, we can continue to enjoy this delicious pasta dish one deadly bite at a time. \n\nSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://yousuckatcooking.com\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\n\nRecipe\n.5 parts pasta to \n.25 parts butter to \n.25 parts parmesan \n\nCook the pasta, strengthen your wrists, and then do all the things. \n\nThe original recipe called for parmesan aged 24 months, which is a young parmesan. I used one aged 36 months so it would taste slightly wiser. Don't even both trying to make the original noodles. It's WAY above your pay grade."

Fortunately, none of these garlic breads are particularly difficult and all of them are fairly delicious. That's because of the garlic and the bread. \n\nYou Suck at Cooking the Book:  http://hyperurl.co/yousuckatcooking\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nhttp://facebook.com/yousuckatcooking\n\nSo, in addition to these simple instructions I\u2019ll just say add more salt if you want to. I highly recommend not using salted butter for the first one since you\u2019re adding more salt. \nWith the basil and parmesan one, just add whatever amount you think will taste good. \nYou can also add parmesan after you bake the garlic bread. \nYou can basically do whatever tf you want. That\u2019s how this all works. \nAlso, I like using the fork-scrape method to determine doneness because if it gets too browned it can get dry, and I think there's this sweet spot where it's just slightly crusty but there's still some melted butter moisture inside. MMMMMMMMMM MELTED BUTTER MOISTURE. \n\nOkay see you later.",

Fortunately, none of these garlic breads are particularly difficult and all of them are fairly delicious. That's because of the garlic and the bread. \n\nYou Suck at Cooking the Book:  http://hyperurl.co/yousuckatcooking\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nhttp://facebook.com/yousuckatcooking\n\nSo, in addition to these simple instructions I\u2019ll just say add more salt if you want to. I highly recommend not using salted butter for the first one since you\u2019re adding more salt. \nWith the basil and parmesan one, just add whatever amount you think will taste good. \nYou can also add parmesan after you bake the garlic bread. \nYou can basically do whatever tf you want. That\u2019s how this all works. \nAlso, I like using the fork-scrape method to determine doneness because if it gets too browned it can get dry, and I think there's this sweet spot where it's just slightly crusty but there's still some melted butter moisture inside. MMMMMMMMMM MELTED BUTTER MOISTURE. \n\nOkay see you later."

Brown it on medium high until it's the color brown. \nAdd in:\n1 teaspoon of salt\n1 tablespoon chilli powder\n1 tablespoon cumin\nMix that all up and add in some water if it's really dry which it probably is \nAdd in 3 cups of basil tomato sauce or whatever tomato sauce \nCook that all together until it's hot and somewhat thick \n\nTake a container of ricotta cheese (15oz/475ml) and shred in a clove of garlic and wangjangle tf out of that then add in a cup and a half of shredded mozzarella and also wandjangle tf out of that\n\nTake an 8 inch baking dish and put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom \nOh don't forget to preheat that undoh on three seventy fundo\nAdd in a layer of sauce \nAdd a layer of expertly cracked noodles \nAdd in a layer of sauce\nA layer of ricotta with two smug spoons \nThen more noodles, sauce, ricotta, (once or twice more depending on the thickness of your ingredient distribution and your feelings on noodles) \nThen add a thick layer of mozzarella on top. More than I did. Or use parmesan like a lot of people do. \n\nBy the way I was totally kidding when I said you could season the beef in the boring way with an onion. Lasagna has a very rich history and classic lasagna is very delicious, although I bet you could get a lot of people fighting over what classic lasagna is, exactly. \n\nI just didn't feel like dicing an onion when someone had already diced the chilli powder and cumin for me. \n\nOh right, cook it for 30 to 40 minutes ish. After you put that foil on top. Then take off that foil and cook it for another ten a bit higher if you want to really melt and/or slightly brown that cheese. \n\nLet me know what I forgot or what I wrote wrong here and then I'll fix it later maybe.",

Brown it on medium high until it's the color brown. \nAdd in:\n1 teaspoon of salt\n1 tablespoon chilli powder\n1 tablespoon cumin\nMix that all up and add in some water if it's really dry which it probably is \nAdd in 3 cups of basil tomato sauce or whatever tomato sauce \nCook that all together until it's hot and somewhat thick \n\nTake a container of ricotta cheese (15oz/475ml) and shred in a clove of garlic and wangjangle tf out of that then add in a cup and a half of shredded mozzarella and also wandjangle tf out of that\n\nTake an 8 inch baking dish and put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom \nOh don't forget to preheat that undoh on three seventy fundo\nAdd in a layer of sauce \nAdd a layer of expertly cracked noodles \nAdd in a layer of sauce\nA layer of ricotta with two smug spoons \nThen more noodles, sauce, ricotta, (once or twice more depending on the thickness of your ingredient distribution and your feelings on noodles) \nThen add a thick layer of mozzarella on top. More than I did. Or use parmesan like a lot of people do. \n\nBy the way I was totally kidding when I said you could season the beef in the boring way with an onion. Lasagna has a very rich history and classic lasagna is very delicious, although I bet you could get a lot of people fighting over what classic lasagna is, exactly. \n\nI just didn't feel like dicing an onion when someone had already diced the chilli powder and cumin for me. \n\nOh right, cook it for 30 to 40 minutes ish. After you put that foil on top. Then take off that foil and cook it for another ten a bit higher if you want to really melt and/or slightly brown that cheese. \n\nLet me know what I forgot or what I wrote wrong here and then I'll fix it later maybe."

In 1971, Nissin introduced Cup Noodles, the first cup noodle product. Instant noodles are marketed worldwide under many brand names.\n\nRamen, a Japanese noodle soup, is sometimes used as a descriptor for instant noodle flavors by some Japanese instant noodle manufacturers. It has become synonymous in America for all instant noodle products.[2]\u201d\n\nIf you've never had actual ramen from a Japanese restaurant, put that at the top of your food-related to do list. Actually go right now. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re at work, just go. \n\nRecipes: \nChecking for WABS is mostly necessary with the cheap North American packets (as far as I know). If you get Asian versions of instant ramen there are a LOT of great ones with tons of flavor, sauces, dehydrated vegetables. Also the ones served in cup seems to be more deluxe. \n\nRecipe #1: Broth of choice, Scallions and eggs. I tend to cook my egg most of the way through but you do you, boo. \n\nRecipe #2: Veggie or chicken broth, Scallions, peanut butter, chopped broccoli. This is my favorite. A simpler version of my spicy peanut butter soup video. \n\nRecipe #3: No broth, Bacon, butter, parmesan. For when you're feeling filthy and want to compound it. \n\nRecipe #4: Veggie or chicken broth, Indian curry paste and chic peas. There are a lot of veggies that would work well in this. There are also a ton of Indian curry pastes but I haven't met one I didn't like. \n\nRecipe #5 Beef broth, spinach, sliced steak. Slice the steak as thinly as possible. I was looking for flank steak, ended up using top sirloin, you could also use hanger steak or skirt steak...there is a lot of opinions on steak cuts but I'm already out of my comfort zone. Just in life in general. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've read this far, congratulations, I'm giving away a prize to the few that get this far. The prize is the gift of reading my random ramblings for the next couple of minutes. \n\nDo you ever find yourself sitting around, living life, then suddenly you\u2019re all WTF? I mean W IN T ACTUAL F. In an existential kind of way. Honestly the weight of actually existing, even when things are going great, is sometimes just super overwhelming. I'm not sure it's really fathomable. I mean if we think about the beginning of the universe and try to imagine the nothing that it came from, it's gotta be a trick. Like there can't have ever been nothing. But if there can't have ever been nothing then\u2026this is the point at which I've actually gone mad. Help.  My brain is trying to stretch in a way it wasn't built for. My brain isn't Simone Biles, you know? And you shouldn't expect it to be. It has limits. But is that just the ceiling of my own confidence? The real problem here is that I said you won a prize, and usually prizes are supposed to be something good where you feel, \"yeah, I totally just won a prize, man, I love prizes.\u201d But just look at this.  I'm not even sorry. It's possible I was up late last night.",

In 1971, Nissin introduced Cup Noodles, the first cup noodle product. Instant noodles are marketed worldwide under many brand names.\n\nRamen, a Japanese noodle soup, is sometimes used as a descriptor for instant noodle flavors by some Japanese instant noodle manufacturers. It has become synonymous in America for all instant noodle products.[2]\u201d\n\nIf you've never had actual ramen from a Japanese restaurant, put that at the top of your food-related to do list. Actually go right now. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re at work, just go. \n\nRecipes: \nChecking for WABS is mostly necessary with the cheap North American packets (as far as I know). If you get Asian versions of instant ramen there are a LOT of great ones with tons of flavor, sauces, dehydrated vegetables. Also the ones served in cup seems to be more deluxe. \n\nRecipe #1: Broth of choice, Scallions and eggs. I tend to cook my egg most of the way through but you do you, boo. \n\nRecipe #2: Veggie or chicken broth, Scallions, peanut butter, chopped broccoli. This is my favorite. A simpler version of my spicy peanut butter soup video. \n\nRecipe #3: No broth, Bacon, butter, parmesan. For when you're feeling filthy and want to compound it. \n\nRecipe #4: Veggie or chicken broth, Indian curry paste and chic peas. There are a lot of veggies that would work well in this. There are also a ton of Indian curry pastes but I haven't met one I didn't like. \n\nRecipe #5 Beef broth, spinach, sliced steak. Slice the steak as thinly as possible. I was looking for flank steak, ended up using top sirloin, you could also use hanger steak or skirt steak...there is a lot of opinions on steak cuts but I'm already out of my comfort zone. Just in life in general. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've read this far, congratulations, I'm giving away a prize to the few that get this far. The prize is the gift of reading my random ramblings for the next couple of minutes. \n\nDo you ever find yourself sitting around, living life, then suddenly you\u2019re all WTF? I mean W IN T ACTUAL F. In an existential kind of way. Honestly the weight of actually existing, even when things are going great, is sometimes just super overwhelming. I'm not sure it's really fathomable. I mean if we think about the beginning of the universe and try to imagine the nothing that it came from, it's gotta be a trick. Like there can't have ever been nothing. But if there can't have ever been nothing then\u2026this is the point at which I've actually gone mad. Help.  My brain is trying to stretch in a way it wasn't built for. My brain isn't Simone Biles, you know? And you shouldn't expect it to be. It has limits. But is that just the ceiling of my own confidence? The real problem here is that I said you won a prize, and usually prizes are supposed to be something good where you feel, \"yeah, I totally just won a prize, man, I love prizes.\u201d But just look at this.  I'm not even sorry. It's possible I was up late last night."

Nobody has time for that and they\u2019re like a buck or two\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not \u201cpumpkin pie filling.\u201d Don\u2019t be an animal\nBut that in a bowl. It\u2019s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you\u2019re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it\u2019s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here\u2019s where you\u2019re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There\u2019s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow.",

                    "description": "The YSAC Cook Book is now available: http://hyperurl.co/yousuckatcooking\nPumpkins are good for literally 2 things; making pumpkin pies, and throwing them off bridges. \nWell I\u2019m all all out of bridges. \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nSnapchat: @yousuckatcookin \nhttp://facebook.com/yousuckatcooking\n\nTo make the pie:\nBuy a pie crust. Nobody has time for that and they\u2019re like a buck or two\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not \u201cpumpkin pie filling.\u201d Don\u2019t be an animal\nBut that in a bowl. It\u2019s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you\u2019re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it\u2019s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here\u2019s where you\u2019re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There\u2019s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

Ask for Stewing Beef.  It's going to break down from being cooked for a long time so it doesn't matter if it's tough. \n\nSear with nothing or just a little bit of oil. You can cook the hell out of it, until it's kinda burnt. I messed this up by adding broth which kept it from searing. A lot of people pat the meat down to make it as dry as possible first. \n\nWhen I make this again I am going to use veggie broth. To me it's fuller flavored than beef broth. I might use cubes and make it slightly stronger. \n\nSo cut the beef up, sear it, then put it in a pot with your broth and start cooking it low and slow. The beef takes longer and if you put in everything together the veggies will fall apart. Feel free to give this an hour head start. \n\nSaute your onions, brown them for flavor, then throw them in. Chop up your potatoes and carrots and throw them in. \n\nSeasoning: I would have started this whole thing with garlic. Really helps to fill out the flavor. I would press a couple cloves in. Salt and pepper. a squirt of dijon. A pinch of chilis for some bite. And a couple herbs don't hurt (thyme and oregano). \n\nBasically keep adjusting but also give it time to cook through. This took a bunch of fiddling as I went but it turned out really good.",

This lentil recipe will have you saying \"wow that was so easy\" unless you don't have the ingredients, in which case it will have you saying \"this is actually impossible\". It's a fine line between the easiest thing ever, and something you will never be able to do no matter how hard you try. But don't let that stop you from trying. \n\nBook + Merch: http://yousuckatcooking.com\nSubscrite: http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nCorn on the knob: http://bit.ly/2bXmwYv \n\nSnapchat: @yousuckatcookin \nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttp://facebook.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttp://patreon.com/yousuckatcooking\n\nDice an onion\nFry it in oil\nSqueeze in a clove of garlic\nCook until golden brownish \nAdd in lentils, water, and a bouillon cube \n(check the package for lentils water ratio or go 1 to 3)\nAdd in a tablespoon of garam masala and the same amount of brown sugar\nIf you don't have garam masala use cumin or curry powder or combine any two or all three of those\nCook it down until it's at a level of thickness that satisfies you \nThen do a few backflips but wear your backflip helmet"

It's delicious.\n\nTake 3 cups of oats. \nCrush 2 cups of any nuts you like. \nTake half a cup of coconut oil and half a cup of maple syrup or honey and mix that all together. \nWith a teaspoon of vanilla extract. \nAnd a teaspoon of sea salt. \nMix it up and bake it at 350. After 15 minutes or so give it a stir. \nThen do that again after another ten minutes or so. \nKeep an eye on it! When it's cooked to an amount you think is good take it out. \nIt will get crispier as it cools down. \nMix in some dried cranberries, blueberries, raisins, or a cup of nothing. \nEnjoy.",

It's delicious.\n\nTake 3 cups of oats. \nCrush 2 cups of any nuts you like. \nTake half a cup of coconut oil and half a cup of maple syrup or honey and mix that all together. \nWith a teaspoon of vanilla extract. \nAnd a teaspoon of sea salt. \nMix it up and bake it at 350. After 15 minutes or so give it a stir. \nThen do that again after another ten minutes or so. \nKeep an eye on it! When it's cooked to an amount you think is good take it out. \nIt will get crispier as it cools down. \nMix in some dried cranberries, blueberries, raisins, or a cup of nothing. \nEnjoy."
