Plus, you likely already have all of the required ingredients hanging out in your pantry.\n\nMade from white rice, this bread comes together quickly with the use of a blender. And with the exception of soaking the rice, it\u2019s in the oven in less than 30 minutes. The result is a moist, spongy, delicious tasting bread with a surprisingly great texture.\n\nHow does rice turn into bread? Rice is full of starch and fiber, and by soaking and blending it, you\u2019re essentially turning it into flour.\n\n#blenderbread #quickbread #glutenfree #riceflour\n\nNeed bread in a hurry? Want a gluten-free variety that doesn\u2019t taste like cardboard? Do you consider bread-making a hassle? Are you a neophyte baker who wants to take baby steps towards dough enlightenment? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, this recipe is for you.",

Plus, you likely already have all of the required ingredients hanging out in your pantry.\n\nMade from white rice, this bread comes together quickly with the use of a blender. And with the exception of soaking the rice, it\u2019s in the oven in less than 30 minutes. The result is a moist, spongy, delicious tasting bread with a surprisingly great texture.\n\nHow does rice turn into bread? Rice is full of starch and fiber, and by soaking and blending it, you\u2019re essentially turning it into flour.\n\n#blenderbread #quickbread #glutenfree #riceflour\n\nNeed bread in a hurry? Want a gluten-free variety that doesn\u2019t taste like cardboard? Do you consider bread-making a hassle? Are you a neophyte baker who wants to take baby steps towards dough enlightenment? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, this recipe is for you."

This technique makes \u201cchampagne\u201d that tastes great, almost instantly, for cheap. And unlike traditional bottled Champagne, this method will also give you fresh, carbonated, fizzy grapes that you can enjoy in or alongside your glass of bubbly.\n\nWe\u2019re calling this \u201cchampagne with a lowercase c\u201d because it\u2019s not made in the Champagne region or the Champagne style, but it\u2019s a fun way to give any wine you like a bubbly boost. Perfect for dinner party toasts during the holiday season and ringing in the new year, you can carbonate white, ros\u00e9, and even red wines\u2014just make sure to pick out a bottle, carton, box, or can of wine that you enjoy drinking. (No point in going through this process using a wine that tastes horrible to begin with.) You can even make sparkling non-alcoholic wine (or \u201ccider\u201d) by carbonating grape and apple juices.\n\nMore at https://chfstps.co/3H2V3j5.

                    "description": "Get all the details \ud83d\udc49 https://chfstps.co/3H2V3j5\nWe all love Champagne, but we don\u2019t love the hefty price tag. This technique makes \u201cchampagne\u201d that tastes great, almost instantly, for cheap. And unlike traditional bottled Champagne, this method will also give you fresh, carbonated, fizzy grapes that you can enjoy in or alongside your glass of bubbly.\n\nWe\u2019re calling this \u201cchampagne with a lowercase c\u201d because it\u2019s not made in the Champagne region or the Champagne style, but it\u2019s a fun way to give any wine you like a bubbly boost. Perfect for dinner party toasts during the holiday season and ringing in the new year, you can carbonate white, ros\u00e9, and even red wines\u2014just make sure to pick out a bottle, carton, box, or can of wine that you enjoy drinking. (No point in going through this process using a wine that tastes horrible to begin with.) You can even make sparkling non-alcoholic wine (or \u201ccider\u201d) by carbonating grape and apple juices.\n\nMore at https://chfstps.co/3H2V3j5.

Instead of individually salt-crusting vegetables, apples, and the turkey, we nestled everything in the cauldron. It's the ChefSteps Cowboy Cauldron Salt-Crusted Turkey Cookout. Did it work?\n\nWhen it comes to Thanksgiving turkey, we eschew tradition in pursuit of epic perfection. While Norman Rockwell\u2019s aesthetic is the turkey that home cooks aspire to create year after year, we\u2019d argue that bird looks a tad overcooked. We ask you\u2014why roast that big bird whole when you can sous vide breasts and legs separately to perfection, prepare a stunning crown and satisfying roulade, turn it into yakitori, or even deep-fry it KFC-style (without burning down the house)?\n\nNever satisfied with the same old, same old, every year we set out to find new ways to prepare a masterpiece Thanksgiving centerpiece. This year harkens back to ChefSteps roots of huge outdoor cooking adventures\u2014think Wall of Fire, Campfire Chicken and Dumplings, and the World\u2019s Largest Sous Vide Pastrami.\n\nWe were inspired by classic Hawaiian \u201cluau turkey.\u201d Prepared in the same manner as ceremonial luau pork, cooked in a @Cowboy Cauldron Co. cauldron, the meat is moist and shreddable.

Instead of individually salt-crusting vegetables, apples, and the turkey, we nestled everything in the cauldron. It's the ChefSteps Cowboy Cauldron Salt-Crusted Turkey Cookout. Did it work?\n\nWhen it comes to Thanksgiving turkey, we eschew tradition in pursuit of epic perfection. While Norman Rockwell\u2019s aesthetic is the turkey that home cooks aspire to create year after year, we\u2019d argue that bird looks a tad overcooked. We ask you\u2014why roast that big bird whole when you can sous vide breasts and legs separately to perfection, prepare a stunning crown and satisfying roulade, turn it into yakitori, or even deep-fry it KFC-style (without burning down the house)?\n\nNever satisfied with the same old, same old, every year we set out to find new ways to prepare a masterpiece Thanksgiving centerpiece. This year harkens back to ChefSteps roots of huge outdoor cooking adventures\u2014think Wall of Fire, Campfire Chicken and Dumplings, and the World\u2019s Largest Sous Vide Pastrami.\n\nWe were inspired by classic Hawaiian \u201cluau turkey.\u201d Prepared in the same manner as ceremonial luau pork, cooked in a @Cowboy Cauldron Co. cauldron, the meat is moist and shreddable. Thanksgiving BBQ? That\u2019s right up our alley!"

Don\u2019t let the thickness fool you\u2014this steak is a tough cut and if you just slap this meat on the grill, you\u2019ll end up with something tough and unpleasantly chewy. Butterflying the steaks first and then pounding them thin with a meat mallet breaks down those tough muscle fibers and connective tissue.\n\nWe\u2019re using Grant\u2019s go-to carne asada recipe here to demonstrate how to transform tough cuts into thin, tender steaks that grill up fast with max flavor and great texture. This precisely imprecise method can be put to good use with a variety of flavor pairings and proteins to expand your grilling horizons.",

                    "description": "https://chfstps.co/3h6Xmr5\n\nWhen it comes to big money steak cuts like ribeyes, strips, and tenderloins, we rely on precision cooking with sous vide to protect our investment and achieve perfect doneness.\nSous vide and other low-and-slow methods are a great way to transform tough cuts\u2014like chuck\u2014into tender steaks that rival those more expensive options.\n\nBut there\u2019s a wide world of steak cuts to discover and there are other ways to tenderize tough cuts so they cook up quickly and are supple and succulent\u2014not stiff and chewy.\nBecause it\u2019s already so thin, skirt steak can be misleading. Don\u2019t let the thickness fool you\u2014this steak is a tough cut and if you just slap this meat on the grill, you\u2019ll end up with something tough and unpleasantly chewy. Butterflying the steaks first and then pounding them thin with a meat mallet breaks down those tough muscle fibers and connective tissue.\n\nWe\u2019re using Grant\u2019s go-to carne asada recipe here to demonstrate how to transform tough cuts into thin, tender steaks that grill up fast with max flavor and great texture. This precisely imprecise method can be put to good use with a variety of flavor pairings and proteins to expand your grilling horizons."

The Whipping Siphons Class is full of unexpected recipes and techniques to make the most of your whipping siphon. Almost reached my quota on saying Whipping Siphons Class... There, did it.\n\nWith nothing but a blender, a whipping siphon, and a microwave, you can have tender, fluffy cakes on the table in less than 10 minutes. This microwave cake has a deliciously rugged, spongy texture that pound cake could only dream of. The feathery layers easily pull apart for a sweet and delicate dessert.\n\nThis recipe makes a plain white cake, but the flavor possibilities are infinite. Mix it up with infused oils and sugars; try toasted sesame oil for a nutty note or roasted cocoa if you\u2019re a chocolate lover.\nBecome a member and be the first to learn about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen: http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd\n\nAnd while you\u2019re at it...\nLike us on Facebook: http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\nFollow us on Instagram: http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj",

The Whipping Siphons Class is full of unexpected recipes and techniques to make the most of your whipping siphon. Almost reached my quota on saying Whipping Siphons Class... There, did it.\n\nWith nothing but a blender, a whipping siphon, and a microwave, you can have tender, fluffy cakes on the table in less than 10 minutes.

Corn!\n\nWe\u2019re talking about hominy\u2014white corn that\u2019s gone through the nixtamalization process. To make a corn tortilla from scratch you first have to soak dried corn kernels in a cal (aka calcium hydroxide) solution. This takes up to 24 hours. But cheap canned hominy has already gone through the process, which saves us a ton of time.\n\nAdding flour, fat, and a leavening agent to blended hominy yields a tortilla that\u2019s tender and stretchy. It has flavor and aroma notes of the corn tortillas we know and love, plus the elasticity, durability, and structure of flour tortillas (which makes this dough ideal to create larger sizes for fajitas and burritos). Truly the best of both worlds.\n\nGo to chefsteps.com for our full Taco Party guide, and subscribe to Studio Pass to get 15% off products from our partner,  @Masienda  through May 31st",

Interested in innovating the feast of brown starches and over-cooked turkey into something memorably delicious instead? We\u2019re happy to offer you this."

                "description": "Love roasted chicken? Get crispier skin and perfect meat with this nontraditional trussing technique:  http://chfstps.co/1KL6kn9\n\nA perfectly roasted chicken is the key to weeknight dinner glory: crispy skin, juicy meat, a beautiful golden-brown color. And while roasting chicken is simple in theory, pitfalls do arise. Sections of the skin get soggy and fail to brown, for instance. The breasts often cook faster than the legs, so that by the time the dark meat is cooked through, the white stuff's all dry. We don't want this to happen to you, which is why we're sharing this new approach to trussing your bird. As you may know, \"trussing\" a chicken means tying it with butcher's twine. Cooks have done this for years to make the bird easier to handle and to help it cook better. But, as we'll show you, the traditional technique for trussing isn't necessarily the best way. Give this new technique a go tonight, and you'll wind up pretty dang pleased at the way dinner turns out. (PSST: It works for turkey, too!)

                    "description": "Love roasted chicken? Get crispier skin and perfect meat with this nontraditional trussing technique:  http://chfstps.co/1KL6kn9\n\nA perfectly roasted chicken is the key to weeknight dinner glory: crispy skin, juicy meat, a beautiful golden-brown color. And while roasting chicken is simple in theory, pitfalls do arise. Sections of the skin get soggy and fail to brown, for instance. The breasts often cook faster than the legs, so that by the time the dark meat is cooked through, the white stuff's all dry. We don't want this to happen to you, which is why we're sharing this new approach to trussing your bird. As you may know, \"trussing\" a chicken means tying it with butcher's twine. Cooks have done this for years to make the bird easier to handle and to help it cook better. But, as we'll show you, the traditional technique for trussing isn't necessarily the best way. Give this new technique a go tonight, and you'll wind up pretty dang pleased at the way dinner turns out. (PSST: It works for turkey, too!)

That's because skimming off the carrot's cellulose (the insoluble polysaccharides that make up the cell walls of plants), strips away any watery, fibrous flavor normally found in a raw carrot, leaving only the carrot's purest essence: sweet, slightly nutty, and, of course, bright orange.

That's because skimming off the carrot's cellulose (the insoluble polysaccharides that make up the cell walls of plants), strips away any watery, fibrous flavor normally found in a raw carrot, leaving only the carrot's purest essence: sweet, slightly nutty, and, of course, bright orange. Likewise, skimming whey off melted butter yields a pure butterfat flavor\u2014creamy, smooth, and rich. http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/carotene-butter\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA\n\nfor more info, visit: http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/carotene-butter"

This is a killer dish for any time of day.\n\nThis recipe was originally inspired by Alain Passard's l'Arp\u00e8ge Egg. Passard's dish consists of a perfectly-poached egg yolk topped with a sherry vinegar--infused cream, and a drizzle of maple syrup. We like ours with a bread component (either brioche, dark rye, or white bread), and we top it with our Sweet Spice. Tie it together with a caramelized Egg White Foam, and with each spoonful you've got an explosion of rainbows in your mouth.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA",

Ooey-gooey sous vide egg yolk, Fried Egg White Foam, toasty brioche cubes, and smoky maple syrup\u2014all delicately layered in a cup. That's how we do first meal. But who are we kidding? This is a killer dish for any time of day.\n\nThis recipe was originally inspired by Alain Passard's l'Arp\u00e8ge Egg. Passard's dish consists of a perfectly-poached egg yolk topped with a sherry vinegar--infused cream, and a drizzle of maple syrup. We like ours with a bread component (either brioche, dark rye, or white bread), and we top it with our Sweet Spice. Tie it together with a caramelized Egg White Foam, and with each spoonful you've got an explosion of rainbows in your mouth.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA"

These tasty confections take the best of the banana\u2014our clarified, sweet banana juice\u2014add bourbon, and enclose it in a creamy layer of chocolate. The finished bonbons burst in your mouth with boozy banana flavor for a fun and delicious effect. (Be sure to pop the whole thing in in one bite, or you'll have a mess!)\n\nTo make them, we dip frozen banana juice into pure cocoa butter first, then into chocolate. The cocoa butter provides a protective wicking layer between the banana juice and the chocolate, so that even as the juice thaws inside the bonbon, it won't saturate the chocolate and turn it soggy. This way, you maintain a snappy chocolate casing even as the banana juice turns to liquid in the fridge.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA",

These tasty confections take the best of the banana\u2014our clarified, sweet banana juice\u2014add bourbon, and enclose it in a creamy layer of chocolate. The finished bonbons burst in your mouth with boozy banana flavor for a fun and delicious effect. (Be sure to pop the whole thing in in one bite, or you'll have a mess!)\n\nTo make them, we dip frozen banana juice into pure cocoa butter first, then into chocolate. The cocoa butter provides a protective wicking layer between the banana juice and the chocolate, so that even as the juice thaws inside the bonbon, it won't saturate the chocolate and turn it soggy. This way, you maintain a snappy chocolate casing even as the banana juice turns to liquid in the fridge.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA"

                "description": "There are few things lovelier than a perfectly poached egg. The way a thick, flavorful yolk, and tender egg white coat a dish in a naturally savory sauce is a beautiful thing. http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/the-egg-calculator\n\nCreating a well-made poached egg\u2014a fundamental technique that until recently sometimes eluded even the finest cooks\u2014became infinitely easier, and perhaps even foolproof, with the rise of sous vide cooking. Now, we need only to accurately measure time and temperature to ensure a perfect product. And we decided that, for us, a 55 g egg in a sous vide water bath set to 167 \u00b0F / 75 \u00b0C for 13 minutes does the trick.\n\nWe cook the egg at a high temperature for a short amount of time (rather than at equilibrium temp for longer) to create a firm egg white that's very similar to a traditionally poached egg.

                    "description": "There are few things lovelier than a perfectly poached egg. The way a thick, flavorful yolk, and tender egg white coat a dish in a naturally savory sauce is a beautiful thing. http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/the-egg-calculator\n\nCreating a well-made poached egg\u2014a fundamental technique that until recently sometimes eluded even the finest cooks\u2014became infinitely easier, and perhaps even foolproof, with the rise of sous vide cooking. Now, we need only to accurately measure time and temperature to ensure a perfect product. And we decided that, for us, a 55 g egg in a sous vide water bath set to 167 \u00b0F / 75 \u00b0C for 13 minutes does the trick.\n\nWe cook the egg at a high temperature for a short amount of time (rather than at equilibrium temp for longer) to create a firm egg white that's very similar to a traditionally poached egg. We find that cooking the eggs at a lower temp for longer leaves us with overly runny whites; not our preferred texture.\n\nBut the beauty is this: With sous vide, you can play with different times and temperatures to produce nearly any desired outcome. Whether you like your eggs runny, firm, thick, or hard-boiled, sous vide gets the job done.

With this recipe, we remove the egg white to focus on perfecting the yolk itself, preserving its natural shape throughout the cooking process. The result? What is usually a subsidiary ingredient shines as a centerpiece to just about any dish. \n\nYou can play with different temperatures and cooking times for various textures, but we found that a range of 62C to 65C, for one or two hours, works best.

The salt and sugar in the brine help to plump and firm it, so it doesn't just fall apart, as it normally would when heated.\n\nHere, the fish is lightly cooked in olive oil with lemon peel, adding depth of flavor and a bit of brightness that complement its natural brine.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA"

We used celery and strawberry as our base flavors, but you can substitute any fruits or vegetables that inspire you (something seasonal, perhaps?). After all, no Italian minestrone is the same, either: recipes vary by region, season, and kitchen, and each is usually as delicious as the last. Here, as in the savory version, a good broth really ties the dish together. Our strawberry broth acts as delicately sweet base for green celery and cucumber, and perfectly complements the soft and tangy fromage blanc sorbet. Again, you can swap for any other flavor, but something as bright and beautiful as strawberry makes for a vividly colorful presentation.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA",

We used celery and strawberry as our base flavors, but you can substitute any fruits or vegetables that inspire you (something seasonal, perhaps?). After all, no Italian minestrone is the same, either: recipes vary by region, season, and kitchen, and each is usually as delicious as the last. Here, as in the savory version, a good broth really ties the dish together. Our strawberry broth acts as delicately sweet base for green celery and cucumber, and perfectly complements the soft and tangy fromage blanc sorbet. Again, you can swap for any other flavor, but something as bright and beautiful as strawberry makes for a vividly colorful presentation.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA"

These days, sodas are mostly boring. But it wasn't always this way: From the late 1870s through the 1930s, sodas made fresh at the local fountain, called phosphates, were a staple of American culture. Fruit-flavored soft drinks were made to order by a soda jerk who added a sweet-and-sour fruit syrup enhanced with phosphoric acid to a chilled glass, and then filled it with carbonated water from the soda fountain. (The name \"jerk,\" by the way, came from the action of flipping the fountain handle back and forth when adding soda water.) We've updated these non-alcoholic counterparts of cocktail culture with freshly prepared [pulp-free fruit juice](http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/pectin-free-juice) (the lack of pulp ensures just the right amount of effervescence and foam). We start by sweetening the juice with flavor-enhancing fructose sugar, and then we balance the taste with a mouth-watering blend of tart malic and phosphoric acids. After chilling the prepared juice, we carbonate it with a soda siphon. Our sodas are just as tart and delicious as old-fashioned phosphates, but with real juice instead of syrup, they take carbonated refreshment to a whole new level.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA",

Eat them smothered in gravy, honey butter, or jam. We use White Lily Self-Rising flour, adding a touch of baking powder for an even fluffier result.\n\nWe cut our biscuits into rectangles so no dough is wasted. Also, as they bake, the biscuits grow into each other, which protects them from case-hardening: the surface won't too quickly become too hard for moisture to escape.\n\nBut if you like round biscuits, simply roll out the dough, skip the freezing step, and use floured round cutters to shape the biscuits.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA",

Eat them smothered in gravy, honey butter, or jam. We use White Lily Self-Rising flour, adding a touch of baking powder for an even fluffier result.\n\nWe cut our biscuits into rectangles so no dough is wasted. Also, as they bake, the biscuits grow into each other, which protects them from case-hardening: the surface won't too quickly become too hard for moisture to escape.\n\nBut if you like round biscuits, simply roll out the dough, skip the freezing step, and use floured round cutters to shape the biscuits.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA"

But bitters, a potent concoction of herbs, roots, and spices, have long been overlooked as a flavor agent in American kitchens. The world's most ubiquitous bitters is Angostura. First crafted in 1824 by the surgeon general of Simon Bolivar's Venezuelan army, bitters were marketed as remedy for upset stomach and hiccups. Today, the closely guarded recipe is produced on the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago where cooks add it by the spoonful to stews and marinades.\n\nWe think bitters plays equally well with sweet recipes as it does with savory ones. Though it might sound counter-intuitive this strawberry sorbet proves that opposite flavors can be surprisingly complementary\u2014and refreshing. Here, the berries' natural sugars soften the bitterness to reveal Angostura's distinct herbal quality. An even more interesting effect comes from bitters being almost 45% alcohol by volume. Though we add only a small amount, the ethanol presence is enough lower the freezing point of the sorbet. This means you have less ice and more unfrozen syrup at freezer temperature and a softer, easier-to-scoop sorbet. Finally, there is the fun science that ethanol evaporates much more quickly than water. When this happens on your palette, the ethanol carries aroma molecules up into your nasal cavity, heightening the strawberry flavor of the melting sorbet.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA",

Strange as it might sound, Cel-Ray--formerly known as Dr. Brown's Celery Tonic--is a popular alternative to lemon-lime soda in the Jewish delicatessens of New York City and South Florida. Its grassy aroma and bitter, vegetal flavor has a polarizing effect on tasters: you either love it or loathe it. We've added a bit of fun by turning the nostalgic refreshment into a cocktail.\n\nWhile Cel-Ray derives its flavor from celery seed extract, we've taken the whole stalk and spun it in a centrifuge to produce an electric green juice of pure, liquid celery. Adding gin and lemon make for a cocktail reminiscent of a gimlet, the prohibition-era classic made from gin, lime and soda.\n\nThe secret to properly carbonating the drink is two-fold. First, we charge the siphon with CO2 and expel the air. This purges the canister of trapped nitrogen and oxygen (gases that don't make liquids fizzy) so the next CO2 charge can dissolve fully without interference. Second, we add ample ice, because gases like CO2 are more soluble in cold liquids than warm liquids.\n\nBesides, who likes a summer cocktail anything but ice cold?\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA",

Achieving such smoothness is the result of how well one can separate large particles from small particles: the smaller the particles, the smoother the puree. Classically, chefs rely on a gamut of filters (sieves, strainers, etc.) to separate particles by size. Another entirely different approach is to separate particles by density. Meet: the centrifuge.

Aside from being a lavish treat\u2014sugar was a luxury for most of history\u2014the preparation serves as a way to preserve a perishable ingredient. Replacing water within an ingredient like an orange with very concentrated sugar syrup inhibits bacterial growth. Traditionally, the technique of preparing candied, crystallized, or glac\u00e9 fruit involves briefly poaching the ingredient in hot sugar syrup, then resting the ingredient to allow sugar to diffuse into the fruit. The process is repeated over days, weeks, or even months depending on the size of the ingredient. At each step, the sugar syrup is concentrated slightly so that eventually the water in the fruit is entirely saturated with sugar.\n\nOur technique is a modern variation that is quick and far less sweet. The blood oranges\u2014you can use other citrus too\u2014are blanched in salted water. The salt diffuses into the pith and masks its bitterness. The oranges are shocked until ice cold, which firms the rind so that it doesn't crack during the vacuum infusion step. A chamber sealer is used to repeatedly vacuum infuse a light sugar syrup into the pith. Finally, a sous vide cooking step softens the rind.\n\nLike a classic orange glac\u00e9, our half-candied blood oranges have an edible sweetened rind. Unlike the classic orange glac\u00e9, the interior of our half-candied blood oranges tastes refreshingly juicy and tart.\n\nAt ChefSteps, we don't tell you how to cook, we show you\u2014with recipes designed to inspire and educate, tested techniques for successful results at home, and a lively forum where you'll chat with other chefs and home-cooking enthusiasts. \n\nVisit ChefSteps.com for more videos, recipes, classes, and techniques. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nBecome a member and be the first to know about new recipes, special offers, and goings-on around the kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1paXXVd \n\nLike us on Facebook to stay updated on our latest projects. http://chfstps.co/1thBubb\n\nFollow us on Instagram http://chfstps.co/1nDs8Fj and Pinterest http://chfstps.co/1koB9kI for peeks inside the daily workings of our Pike Place Market kitchen lab. \n\nRead our blog for inspiring ideas and behind-the-scenes updates. http://chfstps.co/1rhTgh0\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to speed on what's cooking in the ChefSteps kitchen. http://chfstps.co/1gMVbWA",
