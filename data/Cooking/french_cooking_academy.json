Sear the meats really well and only then add the aromatics and then the stock to the pan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************************\nQuality French homeware: https://bit.ly/3jhcmE3\n\n\ud83e\udd50 Become a subscriber and click the bell icon so you never miss a cooking tutorial: https://bit.ly/2Of3oJD\n\n\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f join the FCA community on Patreon: https://bit.ly/2XaXw3F\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f  Spread the word about the channel and the website\n\n\ud83d\uded2 Visit my Amazon cookware page: https://amzn.to/2sQZd9z. \n\nUTENSILS AND COOKWARE STARTER KIT:\n\nThe cast iron pan I always use:\nhttps://amzn.to/343Pvn4\n******************************************************\nThe Mauviel pan I use plus good copper models:\nhttps://amzn.to/2RHSACP\n*******************************************************\nGreat all around cutting board (polypropylene): https://amzn.to/2POc0Ei \nHeavy duty cutting board (wood): \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4J5ZR \nEssential utensil set: \nhttps://amzn.to/2Y3eIc2 \nKitchen scales Us Oz and metric grams:\n https://amzn.to/2Vj0Flx \nMeasuring cups set:\n https://amzn.to/2ViYkqT \n\nGreat starter cookware set (tri-ply clad):\n https://amzn.to/2DWJD2a \nA good nonstick pan:\n https://amzn.to/2VW02OF \nA Great cast iron enameled French made pot (Staub): https://amzn.to/302BvXi \n\nKNIVES AND KNIFE SETS:\n******************************************************* \nGreat value chef knife:\n https://amzn.to/2vKiB9M \nForged knife set (mercer culinary): \nhttps://amzn.to/2WuDZvs \nFibrox knife set (victorinox):\n https://amzn.to/2DRrbaV \n\nGREAT CULINARY BOOKS TO HELP IMPROVE YOUR COOKING\n******************************************************\nGreat books for home cook (from Leiths school foof and wine):\nHow to cook: https://amzn.to/2FW7ses\nHow to cook pastry: https://amzn.to/2HrmKbz\n***************************************************\nFor people wanting to learn technique like in culinary school:\nThe professional chef: \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4xPfW \nLe garde manger: \nhttps://amzn.to/3001yOH \nPaul Bocuse Institute culinary book:\n https://amzn.to/2H4jr7y \nThe complete robuchon:\nhttps://amzn.to/30172cb \nThe professional Patry chef:\nhttps://amzn.to/301Q3WX \nBaking and pastry, mastering the art:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vCU0Ue \nBeautiful French Pastry recipe book:\n https://amzn.to/2H2a1tc \n\nCULINARY REFERENCE GUIDES:\n************************************* \nEscoffier culinary guide (in english):\n https://amzn.to/2PP8ZUr \nLarousse gastronomique:\nhttps://amzn.to/2H4HWBK \nLe repertoire de la cuisine (in english):\nhttps://amzn.to/2H3TKE5 \nWorld atlas of wine:\nhttps://amzn.to/2VLiB84",

This French version of the sauce piquante is a tangy sauce with tomato, gherkins and fresh herbs .\n\nGet the recipe: https://www.thefrenchcookingacademy.com/recipes/escoffier-sauce-piquante\n\n  Learn to make classic sauce with our online course: https://bit.ly/3jkuhcT\n\ud83d\ude00 SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL: https://bit.ly/2Of3oJD\n\ud83d\udc8c JOIN OUR NEWSLETTER\u25bahttps://bit.ly/2lNomli\n\n0:00     Intro\n3:26     The components of a sauce\n04:52   Homemade cooking stock and alternatives\n07:00   Making the sauce\n17:47  Tasting notes\n\n\ud83e\uddc5\ud83e\udd55INGREDIENTS\ud83e\udd55\ud83e\uddc5\n\nFor the sauce base:\n500 ml / 2 cups  brown veal or beef stock  (either freshly made or of the shelf)\n1 tablespoon onion (small rough chop)\n1 tablespoon carrot (small rough chop)\n1 tablespoon celery (small rough chop)\n30 grams /1 oz pork belly (unsmoked and unsalted) cut small pieces\n1 tablespoon of mushrooms trimming ( optional)\na small twig of thyme\n100 ml / 3.3 fluid oz dry white wine\n1 and a half tablespoon tomato paste\n20  /0.7 oz grams butter\n15 grams /0.5 oz plain all purpose (or T45 flour ideally) use 10 grams for a thinner consistency and more subtle taste.\n\nFor the reduction and flavoring:\n150 ml / 5 fluid oz dry white wine \n150 ml / 5 fluid oz good quality red or white wine vinegar ( I used apple cider vinegar)\n1 tablespoon sweet and sour gherkins (finely chopped)\n1 tablespoon of parsley (finely chopped)\n1 tablespoon of chervil (finely chopped)\n1 tablespoon of tarragon (finely chopped)\n20 to 30 grams /1 oz (finely chopped shallot)\nsalt and pepper to season (I actually forgot to mention this in the video but the seasoning has to be added just before the herbs and gherkins. season to your own taste and add more pepper then salt.\n\nCooking notes:\n- When combining the reduction and sauce base you only need to use 300 ml of  the sauce base and add it to the vinegar and wine reduction.\n- The sauce base has to be cooked and reduced for 20 minutes on low heat.\n- The reduction of vinegar and wine must be reduced by half so you are left with only 150 ml in total at the end.\nIf you use an \"of the shelf\" ready made stock as shown in the video you will need to add 200 grams of beef of veal meat trimming alongside the pork. Sear the meats really well and only then add the aromatics and then the stock to the pan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************************\nQuality French homeware: https://bit.ly/3jhcmE3\n\n\ud83e\udd50 Become a subscriber and click the bell icon so you never miss a cooking tutorial: https://bit.ly/2Of3oJD\n\n\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f join the FCA community on Patreon: https://bit.ly/2XaXw3F\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f  Spread the word about the channel and the website\n\n\ud83d\uded2 Visit my Amazon cookware page: https://amzn.to/2sQZd9z. \n\nUTENSILS AND COOKWARE STARTER KIT:\n\nThe cast iron pan I always use:\nhttps://amzn.to/343Pvn4\n******************************************************\nThe Mauviel pan I use plus good copper models:\nhttps://amzn.to/2RHSACP\n*******************************************************\nGreat all around cutting board (polypropylene): https://amzn.to/2POc0Ei \nHeavy duty cutting board (wood): \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4J5ZR \nEssential utensil set: \nhttps://amzn.to/2Y3eIc2 \nKitchen scales Us Oz and metric grams:\n https://amzn.to/2Vj0Flx \nMeasuring cups set:\n https://amzn.to/2ViYkqT \n\nGreat starter cookware set (tri-ply clad):\n https://amzn.to/2DWJD2a \nA good nonstick pan:\n https://amzn.to/2VW02OF \nA Great cast iron enameled French made pot (Staub): https://amzn.to/302BvXi \n\nKNIVES AND KNIFE SETS:\n******************************************************* \nGreat value chef knife:\n https://amzn.to/2vKiB9M \nForged knife set (mercer culinary): \nhttps://amzn.to/2WuDZvs \nFibrox knife set (victorinox):\n https://amzn.to/2DRrbaV \n\nGREAT CULINARY BOOKS TO HELP IMPROVE YOUR COOKING\n******************************************************\nGreat books for home cook (from Leiths school foof and wine):\nHow to cook: https://amzn.to/2FW7ses\nHow to cook pastry: https://amzn.to/2HrmKbz\n***************************************************\nFor people wanting to learn technique like in culinary school:\nThe professional chef: \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4xPfW \nLe garde manger: \nhttps://amzn.to/3001yOH \nPaul Bocuse Institute culinary book:\n https://amzn.to/2H4jr7y \nThe complete robuchon:\nhttps://amzn.to/30172cb \nThe professional Patry chef:\nhttps://amzn.to/301Q3WX \nBaking and pastry, mastering the art:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vCU0Ue \nBeautiful French Pastry recipe book:\n https://amzn.to/2H2a1tc \n\nCULINARY REFERENCE GUIDES:\n************************************* \nEscoffier culinary guide (in english):\n https://amzn.to/2PP8ZUr \nLarousse gastronomique:\nhttps://amzn.to/2H4HWBK \nLe repertoire de la cuisine (in english):\nhttps://amzn.to/2H3TKE5 \nWorld atlas of wine:\nhttps://amzn.to/2VLiB84"

So cooking times can vary, the higher the temperature the shorter the cooking times.\n\nTips: Milk bring a softness to the crust but if you prefer a dough that it harder and crispier then replace the milk by water.\n\nNote: if the dough is very slightly wet at the end when gathering the dough in a ball, just sprinkle a little bit of flour on your bench and roll the dough in the flour before doing the kneading.\n\n\n**********************************************************************************\nQuality French homeware: https://bit.ly/3jhcmE3\n\n\ud83e\udd50 Become a subscriber and click the bell icon so you never miss a cooking tutorial: https://bit.ly/2Of3oJD\n\n\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f join the FCA community on Patreon: https://bit.ly/2XaXw3F\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f  Spread the word about the channel and the website\n\n\ud83d\uded2 Visit my Amazon cookware page: https://amzn.to/2sQZd9z. \n\nUTENSILS AND COOKWARE STARTER KIT:\n\nThe cast iron pan I always use:\nhttps://amzn.to/343Pvn4\n******************************************************\nThe Mauviel pan I use plus good copper models:\nhttps://amzn.to/2RHSACP\n*******************************************************\nGreat all around cutting board (polypropylene): https://amzn.to/2POc0Ei \nHeavy duty cutting board (wood): \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4J5ZR \nEssential utensil set: \nhttps://amzn.to/2Y3eIc2 \nKitchen scales Us Oz and metric grams:\n https://amzn.to/2Vj0Flx \nMeasuring cups set:\n https://amzn.to/2ViYkqT \n\nGreat starter cookware set (tri-ply clad):\n https://amzn.to/2DWJD2a \nA good nonstick pan:\n https://amzn.to/2VW02OF \nA Great cast iron enameled French made pot (Staub): https://amzn.to/302BvXi \n\nKNIVES AND KNIFE SETS:\n******************************************************* \nGreat value chef knife:\n https://amzn.to/2vKiB9M \nForged knife set (mercer culinary): \nhttps://amzn.to/2WuDZvs \nFibrox knife set (victorinox):\n https://amzn.to/2DRrbaV \n\nGREAT CULINARY BOOKS TO HELP IMPROVE YOUR COOKING\n******************************************************\nGreat books for home cook (from Leiths school foof and wine):\nHow to cook: https://amzn.to/2FW7ses\nHow to cook pastry: https://amzn.to/2HrmKbz\n***************************************************\nFor people wanting to learn technique like in culinary school:\nThe professional chef: \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4xPfW \nLe garde manger: \nhttps://amzn.to/3001yOH \nPaul Bocuse Institute culinary book:\n https://amzn.to/2H4jr7y \nThe complete robuchon:\nhttps://amzn.to/30172cb \nThe professional Patry chef:\nhttps://amzn.to/301Q3WX \nBaking and pastry, mastering the art:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vCU0Ue \nBeautiful French Pastry recipe book:\n https://amzn.to/2H2a1tc \n\nCULINARY REFERENCE GUIDES:\n************************************* \nEscoffier culinary guide (in english):\n https://amzn.to/2PP8ZUr \nLarousse gastronomique:\nhttps://amzn.to/2H4HWBK \nLe repertoire de la cuisine (in english):\nhttps://amzn.to/2H3TKE5 \nWorld atlas of wine:\nhttps://amzn.to/2VLiB84"

This week we are making a recipe from the south of France called the anise cream sauce ad we serve it with salmon (cold). This sauce is perfect to serve with cold fish, vegetable (like asparagus) or even hard boiled eggs. The big thing about that sauce is that we are going to use some pastis which adds real boost of anise flavor in the sauce. in this vide I will be serving the sauce with a locally caught Tasmanian salmon.\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf73 ENROLL IN MY ONLINE COOKING CLASSES: https://bit.ly/2QZM7TX\n\ud83d\ude00 SUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2Of3oJD\n\ud83d\udc8c NEWSLETTER\u25bahttps://bit.ly/2lNomli\n\n\ud83e\uddc5\ud83e\udd55INGREDIENTS\ud83e\udd55\ud83e\uddc5\n100 grams fennel ( bulb)\n2 hard boiled eggs\n1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard\njuice of half a lemon\n5 tablespoons olive oil\n4 to 5 tablespoon of pure cream ( heavy whipping cream)\n1 tablespoon pastis\nsalt and pepper to season\n\ncooking time:\nFennel: boil for 30 minutes\nHard boiled eggs: 10 minutes\n\nRecommended cookware:\na vegetable mill\n\nBonus: how to enjoy and serve a good glass of Pastis. as it is done in Marseille the rule are very simple but also very important:\n\n* First rule: never add the ice cubes in the glass first\n*  Second rule: Always use 1 volume of pastis (usually 20 ml) for 5 volume of water\n* lastly to serve: pour the pastis in a small glass, add very cold water over the pastis and if you like then add a few ice cubes.\nThe quality of the water matters too if you want the best experience use ice cold mineral water and no ice cubes.\nEnjoy\n\n#pastis # anise #mauvielcooking\n\n**********************************************************************************\nIF YOU LIKE MY VIDEOS PLEASE SUPPORT MY CHANNEL\n\n\ud83e\udd50 Become a subscriber and click the bell icon so you never miss a cooking tutorial: https://bit.ly/2Of3oJD\n\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f join the FCA community on Patreon: https://bit.ly/2XaXw3F\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f  Spread the word about the channel and the website\n\n\ud83d\uded2 Visit my Amazon cookware page: https://amzn.to/2sQZd9z. \n\nUTENSILS AND COOKWARE STARTER KIT:\n******************************************************\nThe Mauviel pan I use plus good copper models:\nhttps://amzn.to/2RHSACP\n*******************************************************\nGreat all around cutting board (polypropylene): https://amzn.to/2POc0Ei \nHeavy duty cutting board (wood): \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4J5ZR \nEssential utensil set: \nhttps://amzn.to/2Y3eIc2 \nKitchen scales Us Oz and metric grams:\n https://amzn.to/2Vj0Flx \nMeasuring cups set:\n https://amzn.to/2ViYkqT \n\nGreat starter cookware set (tri-ply clad):\n https://amzn.to/2DWJD2a \nA good nonstick pan:\n https://amzn.to/2VW02OF \nA Great cast iron enameled French made pot (Staub): https://amzn.to/302BvXi \n\nKNIVES AND KNIFE SETS:\n******************************************************* \nGreat value chef knife:\n https://amzn.to/2vKiB9M \nForged knife set (mercer culinary): \nhttps://amzn.to/2WuDZvs \nFibrox knife set (victorinox):\n https://amzn.to/2DRrbaV \n\nGREAT CULINARY BOOKS TO HELP IMPROVE YOUR COOKING\n******************************************************\nGreat books for home cook (from Leiths school foof and wine):\nHow to cook: https://amzn.to/2FW7ses\nHow to cook pastry: https://amzn.to/2HrmKbz\n***************************************************\nFor people wanting to learn technique like in culinary school:\nThe professional chef: \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4xPfW \nLe garde manger: \nhttps://amzn.to/3001yOH \nPaul Bocuse Institute culinary book:\n https://amzn.to/2H4jr7y \nThe complete robuchon:\nhttps://amzn.to/30172cb \nThe professional Patry chef:\nhttps://amzn.to/301Q3WX \nBaking and pastry, mastering the art:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vCU0Ue \nBeautiful French Pastry recipe book:\n https://amzn.to/2H2a1tc \n\nCULINARY REFERENCE GUIDES:\n************************************* \nEscoffier culinary guide (in english):\n https://amzn.to/2PP8ZUr \nLarousse gastronomique:\nhttps://amzn.to/2H4HWBK \nLe repertoire de la cuisine (in english):\nhttps://amzn.to/2H3TKE5 \nWorld atlas of wine:\nhttps://amzn.to/2VLiB84"

It has been done that way since 1891, when a French chef called Charles Bri\u00e8re presented his version of the dish at a competition in Paris - which is the \"new\" base of the recipe that most people use today. so if you feel adventurous give it a try.\n\n**********************************************************************************\nIF YOU LIKE MY VIDEOS PLEASE SUPPORT MY CHANNEL\n\n\ud83e\udd50 Become a subscriber and click the bell icon so you never miss a cooking tutorial: https://bit.ly/2Of3oJD\n\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f join the FCA community on Patreon: https://bit.ly/2XaXw3F\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f  Spread the word about the channel and the website\n\n\ud83d\uded2 Visit my Amazon cookware page: https://amzn.to/2sQZd9z. \n\nUTENSILS AND COOKWARE STARTER KIT:\n*******************************************************\nGreat all around cutting board (polypropylene): https://amzn.to/2POc0Ei \nHeavy duty cutting board (wood): \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4J5ZR \nEssential utensil set: \nhttps://amzn.to/2Y3eIc2 \nKitchen scales Us Oz and metric grams:\n https://amzn.to/2Vj0Flx \nMeasuring cups set:\n https://amzn.to/2ViYkqT \n\nGreat starter cookware set (tri-ply clad):\n https://amzn.to/2DWJD2a \nA good nonstick pan:\n https://amzn.to/2VW02OF \nA Great cast iron enameled French made pot (Staub): https://amzn.to/302BvXi \n\nKNIVES AND KNIFE SETS:\n******************************************************* \nGreat value chef knife:\n https://amzn.to/2vKiB9M \nForged knife set (mercer culinary): \nhttps://amzn.to/2WuDZvs \nFibrox knife set (victorinox):\n https://amzn.to/2DRrbaV \n\nGREAT CULINARY BOOKS TO HELP IMPROVE YOUR COOKING\n******************************************************\n\nThe professional chef: \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4xPfW \nLe garde manger: \nhttps://amzn.to/3001yOH \nPaul Bocuse Institute culinary book:\n https://amzn.to/2H4jr7y \nThe complete robuchon:\nhttps://amzn.to/30172cb \nThe professional Patry chef:\nhttps://amzn.to/301Q3WX \nBaking and pastry, mastering the art:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vCU0Ue \nBeautiful French Pastry recipe book:\n https://amzn.to/2H2a1tc \n\nCULINARY REFERENCE GUIDES:\n************************************* \n\nEscoffier culinary guide (in english):\n https://amzn.to/2PP8ZUr \nLarousse gastronomique:\nhttps://amzn.to/2H4HWBK \nLe repertoire de la cuisine (in english):\nhttps://amzn.to/2H3TKE5 \nWorld atlas of wine:\nhttps://amzn.to/2VLiB84"

Also important, is the look, this gratin will bring you what I call the \"brickwork look\". Which is the visual aspect of potatoes perfectly stacked on top of each other when cutting the gratin. Enjoy.\n\n UPDATED RECIPE: ( I have adjusted the ingredients to be able to just pour all the liquid over the potatoes without any reduction) For smaller portion just divide everything by half.\n\n\ud83e\uddc5\ud83e\udd55INGREDIENTS\ud83e\udd55\ud83e\uddc5\n1.5 kg (3.3 pound) of waxy yellow flesh potatoes.

( 2 bruised and kept whole and 2 finely diced for the gratin dish))\nSeasoning:\nsalt, pepper and freshly grated nutmeg\n\nCooking time:\nPre-cooking the potatoes: 15 to 20 minutes from boiling point\nGratin oven cooking time (I used a fan forced oven): 45 minutes to an hour at 160 degrees Celsius (320 Fahrenheit)\n\nThe gratin dish is used (affiliate link)\nhttps://amzn.to/2MwIK4a\n\nNotes: \n* The potatoes have to be cut into 4 to 5 millimetre (around 0.15 inches) thick slices using a mandoline or a food processor.\n* ONCE COOKED THE GRATIN HAS TO REST FOR AN HOUR AT ROOM TEMPERATURE TO ALLOW FOR THE CREAM TO SET.\n\n**********************************************************************************\nIF YOU LIKE MY VIDEOS PLEASE SUPPORT MY CHANNEL\n\n\ud83e\udd50 Become a subscriber and click the bell icon so you never miss a cooking tutorial: https://bit.ly/2Of3oJD\n\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f join the FCA community on Patreon: https://bit.ly/2XaXw3F\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f  Spread the word about the channel and the website\n\n\ud83d\uded2 Visit my Amazon cookware page: https://amzn.to/2sQZd9z. \n\nUTENSILS AND COOKWARE STARTER KIT:\n*******************************************************\nGreat all around cutting board (polypropylene): https://amzn.to/2POc0Ei \nHeavy duty cutting board (wood): \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4J5ZR \nEssential utensil set: \nhttps://amzn.to/2Y3eIc2 \nKitchen scales Us Oz and metric grams:\n https://amzn.to/2Vj0Flx \nMeasuring cups set:\n https://amzn.to/2ViYkqT \n\nGreat starter cookware set (tri-ply clad):\n https://amzn.to/2DWJD2a \nA good nonstick pan:\n https://amzn.to/2VW02OF \nA Great cast iron enameled French made pot (Staub): https://amzn.to/302BvXi \n\nKNIVES AND KNIFE SETS:\n******************************************************* \nGreat value chef knife:\n https://amzn.to/2vKiB9M \nForged knife set (mercer culinary): \nhttps://amzn.to/2WuDZvs \nFibrox knife set (victorinox):\n https://amzn.to/2DRrbaV \n\nGREAT CULINARY BOOKS TO HELP IMPROVE YOUR COOKING\n******************************************************\n\nThe professional chef: \nhttps://amzn.to/2H4xPfW \nLe garde manger: \nhttps://amzn.to/3001yOH \nPaul Bocuse Institute culinary book:\n https://amzn.to/2H4jr7y \nThe complete robuchon:\nhttps://amzn.to/30172cb \nThe professional Patry chef:\nhttps://amzn.to/301Q3WX \nBaking and pastry, mastering the art:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vCU0Ue \nBeautiful French Pastry recipe book:\n https://amzn.to/2H2a1tc \n\nCULINARY REFERENCE GUIDES:\n************************************* \n\nEscoffier culinary guide (in english):\n https://amzn.to/2PP8ZUr \nLarousse gastronomique:\nhttps://amzn.to/2H4HWBK \nLe repertoire de la cuisine (in english):\nhttps://amzn.to/2H3TKE5 \nWorld atlas of wine:\nhttps://amzn.to/2VLiB84"

Get the recipe: https://bit.ly/357L0Ml\n\n\nIt is usually served as a snack on fresh or toasted bread, it's a perfect summer appetizer.

This delicious sauce is built on a base of reduced brown chicken stock and flavored with port and Madeira wine along with cream. Once the sauce base has been reduced, foie gras butter is added to create a silky and flavorsome sauce.\n\nThe sauce foie gras can be used with poultry, white meats and pigeons or simply served with fresh pastas (e.g. tagliatelle).\n\nIngredients needed:\n- 50 grams foie gras (cooked)\n- 50 grams unsalted baratte butter (french style butter)\n- 150 ml of homemade brown chicken stock (heavily reduced)\n- 50 ml of Madeira wine\n- 50 ml of port wine\n- 150 ml of liquid cream 30 % fat (heavy whipping cream)\n- salt and pepper.\n- Optional:  2 tablespoons of dried Cepes mushrooms (forest mushrooms)\n- For the garnish: Walnuts and parsley\n\nIn my video I added dried mushrooms to the sauce to enhance the flavour but this is optional. If you decide to add dried mushrooms read the instructions below:\n\n-Instructions for the mushrooms: Soak in warm water for 15 minutes and keep some of the juice for the sauce. \n-After 15 minutes drain the mushrooms and plunge them in boiling water for 1 minute before adding them to the sauce.\n\nNote for the sauce making:\nStart with 250 ml of liquid (includes the 150 ml brown stock, the 50 ml Madeira wine and the 50 ml of port wine) then reduce until you're left with 200 ml of liquid. When adding the cream, leave to reduce until the sauce coats the spoon (as shown in the video).\n\nThis delicious sauce can be served with:\n- White meats\n- Poultry\n- Light game meats: Pigeons and duck breasts\n\nMY FILMING EQUIPMENT:\n************************************\nVIDEO CAMERA:\nhttps://amzn.to/2x5MDox\n\nMICROPHONE:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Oclckm\n\nHANDHELD CAMERA:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Sy0EEi\n\nDSLR PHOTO CAMERA:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Xq0Hpr\n\nPORTRAIT LENS:\nhttps://amzn.to/2EFbSTG\n\nMACRO LENS:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nzwm37\n\n(Affiliate links)\n\n              IF YOU LIKE WATCHING MY VIDEOS PLEASE\n                  CONSIDER ONE OF THE OPTIONS BELOW \n                     ( It really helps support the channel)\n\n* Spread the word about the channel and the website.\n\n* Check my Amazon cookware page ( affiliate link)\n   https://amzn.to/2sQZd9z",

Soaking in the paris atmosphere on a sunny winter's day in the 6th arrondissement. \n\nStreets are lined with a variety of artisan shops selling beautiful patisseries, bread, seafood and goods. \n\nEvery time I go back to Paris I am always amazed by the diversity of shops packed into one street and the 'joie de vivre' that Parisian's have so effortlessly perfected. This is especially noticiable around the rive gauche (left bank) arrondissement.\n\nThis video provides a glimpse of the St Germains des Pres and the Montparnasse area. The boulevard is fantastic for bistrot and seafood and St Germain is perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon stroll and enjoying un cafe on the terrace while watching the world go by. \n\n\nMY FILMING EQUIPMENT:\n************************************\nVIDEO CAMERA:\nhttps://amzn.to/2x5MDox\n\nMICROPHONE:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Oclckm\n\nHANDHELD CAMERA:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Sy0EEi\n\nDSLR PHOTO CAMERA:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Xq0Hpr\n\nPORTRAIT LENS:\nhttps://amzn.to/2EFbSTG\n\nMACRO LENS:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nzwm37\n\n(Affiliate links)\n\n\n********************************************************************\n                IF YOU LIKE WATCHING MY VIDEOS PLEASE\n                  CONSIDER ONE OF THE OPTIONS BELOW \n                     ( It really helps support the channel)\n\n* Spread the word about the channel and the website.\n\n* Check my Amazon cookware page ( affiliate link)\n   https://www.amazon.com/shop/thefrenchcookingacademy",

Soaking in the paris atmosphere on a sunny winter's day in the 6th arrondissement. \n\nStreets are lined with a variety of artisan shops selling beautiful patisseries, bread, seafood and goods. \n\nEvery time I go back to Paris I am always amazed by the diversity of shops packed into one street and the 'joie de vivre' that Parisian's have so effortlessly perfected. This is especially noticiable around the rive gauche (left bank) arrondissement.\n\nThis video provides a glimpse of the St Germains des Pres and the Montparnasse area. The boulevard is fantastic for bistrot and seafood and St Germain is perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon stroll and enjoying un cafe on the terrace while watching the world go by. \n\n\nMY FILMING EQUIPMENT:\n************************************\nVIDEO CAMERA:\nhttps://amzn.to/2x5MDox\n\nMICROPHONE:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Oclckm\n\nHANDHELD CAMERA:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Sy0EEi\n\nDSLR PHOTO CAMERA:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Xq0Hpr\n\nPORTRAIT LENS:\nhttps://amzn.to/2EFbSTG\n\nMACRO LENS:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nzwm37\n\n(Affiliate links)\n\n\n********************************************************************\n                IF YOU LIKE WATCHING MY VIDEOS PLEASE\n                  CONSIDER ONE OF THE OPTIONS BELOW \n                     ( It really helps support the channel)\n\n* Spread the word about the channel and the website.\n\n* Check my Amazon cookware page ( affiliate link)\n   https://www.amazon.com/shop/thefrenchcookingacademy"

                "description": "The chicken and rice supreme is a classic French recipe that celebrates the taste of chicken. Plenty of homemade chicken stock is used to poach the chicken then cook a pilaf rice and finally make the famous supreme sauce.\n\nHowever the big challenge here is to get your chicken stock concentrated enough so that the taste really shine throughout the sauce it si based on.\n\nIn this video you will see that I actually went with the idea that I could get away with using the slightly reduce chicken stock I made in previous video and use that for this whole recipe.\n\n Escoffier was hinting on his book that you need to have strong and perfectly reduce stock already at hand plus some other things like chicken essence amongst other thing to get the sauce done right.\n\nNote that to make that recipe properly and finish it in time for serving you need to have at least 2 cups of concentrated chicken stock made from the reduction of 4 cups of the white chicken stock we have made in the previous video)\n\nFOR WRITTEN RECIPES\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\nGood videos to watch that will help making that recipe:\n\nHow to make the chicken stock:\nhttps://youtu.be/uDVhNwuPj8E\n\nHow to make the bouquet garni:\nhttps://youtu.be/V35qP2dEywg\n\nVideo on how to white cook the mushrooms:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RDrBZDspXk&t=6m19s\n\nHow to make the parchment paper lid:\nhttps://youtu.be/jLRLiKMbVto\n\n****************** RECIPE SECTION ****************************\n\nPOT AND PANS:\n\nLarge stock:\nhttps://amzn.to/2wWtTsg\n\nSaucepans:\nhttps://amzn.to/2MX6fpv\n\nMy favorite whisk\nhttps://amzn.to/2CwzgUe\n\nCOOKING TIME:\n\nChicken: \n45 minutes plus 15 minutes resting time.\nFor the Rice 20 Minutes at 180 celcius\n\nVeloute (Supreme sauce) :\nReduce the veloute on low to medium heat for 10 minutes first then add the mushroom juice the cream and reduce again for 10 minutes. add the chicken essence and reduce again until the chicken flavour become predominant in the sauce ( that can take up to 15 minutes) at the end turn the heat off and add an extra tablespoon of cream plus the quartered mushrooms.\n\nMAIN INGREDIENTS:\n\n1 chicken of 1.5 kilos or bigger\n4 chicken wings ( for extra flavour )\n8 cups of white chicken stock to cook the chicken ( but you can use water instead)\n1 medium size carrot roughly diced ( 100 grams)\n1 onion roughly diced\n1 celery rib roughly diced\n1 bouquet garni\nsalt and pepper fo the seasoning\n\nTo make the Pilaf rice:\n400 grams /2 cups of long grain rice ( I used jasmine rice)\n750 ml/ 3 cups of chicken stock\n1 medium size onion finely chopped\n1 bouquet garni ( I forgot to show it in the video)\n\n*To make the white roux:\n30 grams /2 tbsp butter \n30 grams /3.5tbsp flour \n\nTo make the sauce:\nwhite roux made with the above measurements*\n500 ml /2 cups of reduced chicken stock\n100 ml / 0.4 cups of cream ( heavy or thick cream)\n2 tablespoons of chicken essence (optional)\n3 tablespoons of mushroom cooking juices ( essence)\n1 tablespoon of butter\n\nFor the mushrooms:\nMushrooms have to be white cooked and the juice need to be reduced to make an essence.\n\nTO WHITE COOK THE MUSHROOM FOLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS\nIn a saucepan put the following ingredients:\n2 handful of quartered button mushroom\n1 tablespoon of plain butter\na pinch of salt\na squeeze of lemon juice\nenough water to barely cover the mushroom\nbring to the boil then then simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.\nturn the heat of and leave to infuse for  30 minutes\n\n**************************************************************\n\nCheck my cookware for the cookware I am using\nhttps://goo.gl/krYqny\n\nsupport my work on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/frenchcookingacademy\n\nThe one and only cast iron dutch oven I use:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k7w5K7\n\nMy favorite frying pan:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k4wIUx\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttps://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nFOR WRITTEN RECIPES\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************",

Plenty of homemade chicken stock is used to poach the chicken then cook a pilaf rice and finally make the famous supreme sauce.\n\nHowever the big challenge here is to get your chicken stock concentrated enough so that the taste really shine throughout the sauce it si based on.\n\nIn this video you will see that I actually went with the idea that I could get away with using the slightly reduce chicken stock I made in previous video and use that for this whole recipe.\n\n Escoffier was hinting on his book that you need to have strong and perfectly reduce stock already at hand plus some other things like chicken essence amongst other thing to get the sauce done right.\n\nNote that to make that recipe properly and finish it in time for serving you need to have at least 2 cups of concentrated chicken stock made from the reduction of 4 cups of the white chicken stock we have made in the previous video)\n\nFOR WRITTEN RECIPES\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\nGood videos to watch that will help making that recipe:\n\nHow to make the chicken stock:\nhttps://youtu.be/uDVhNwuPj8E\n\nHow to make the bouquet garni:\nhttps://youtu.be/V35qP2dEywg\n\nVideo on how to white cook the mushrooms:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RDrBZDspXk&t=6m19s\n\nHow to make the parchment paper lid:\nhttps://youtu.be/jLRLiKMbVto\n\n****************** RECIPE SECTION ****************************\n\nPOT AND PANS:\n\nLarge stock:\nhttps://amzn.to/2wWtTsg\n\nSaucepans:\nhttps://amzn.to/2MX6fpv\n\nMy favorite whisk\nhttps://amzn.to/2CwzgUe\n\nCOOKING TIME:\n\nChicken: \n45 minutes plus 15 minutes resting time.\nFor the Rice 20 Minutes at 180 celcius\n\nVeloute (Supreme sauce) :\nReduce the veloute on low to medium heat for 10 minutes first then add the mushroom juice the cream and reduce again for 10 minutes. add the chicken essence and reduce again until the chicken flavour become predominant in the sauce ( that can take up to 15 minutes) at the end turn the heat off and add an extra tablespoon of cream plus the quartered mushrooms.\n\nMAIN INGREDIENTS:\n\n1 chicken of 1.5 kilos or bigger\n4 chicken wings ( for extra flavour )\n8 cups of white chicken stock to cook the chicken ( but you can use water instead)\n1 medium size carrot roughly diced ( 100 grams)\n1 onion roughly diced\n1 celery rib roughly diced\n1 bouquet garni\nsalt and pepper fo the seasoning\n\nTo make the Pilaf rice:\n400 grams /2 cups of long grain rice ( I used jasmine rice)\n750 ml/ 3 cups of chicken stock\n1 medium size onion finely chopped\n1 bouquet garni ( I forgot to show it in the video)\n\n*To make the white roux:\n30 grams /2 tbsp butter \n30 grams /3.5tbsp flour \n\nTo make the sauce:\nwhite roux made with the above measurements*\n500 ml /2 cups of reduced chicken stock\n100 ml / 0.4 cups of cream ( heavy or thick cream)\n2 tablespoons of chicken essence (optional)\n3 tablespoons of mushroom cooking juices ( essence)\n1 tablespoon of butter\n\nFor the mushrooms:\nMushrooms have to be white cooked and the juice need to be reduced to make an essence.\n\nTO WHITE COOK THE MUSHROOM FOLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS\nIn a saucepan put the following ingredients:\n2 handful of quartered button mushroom\n1 tablespoon of plain butter\na pinch of salt\na squeeze of lemon juice\nenough water to barely cover the mushroom\nbring to the boil then then simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.\nturn the heat of and leave to infuse for  30 minutes\n\n**************************************************************\n\nCheck my cookware for the cookware I am using\nhttps://goo.gl/krYqny\n\nsupport my work on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/frenchcookingacademy\n\nThe one and only cast iron dutch oven I use:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k7w5K7\n\nMy favorite frying pan:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k4wIUx\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttps://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nFOR WRITTEN RECIPES\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************"

( reserve some chicken meat to for serving)\n1 egg yolks\nup to 200 ml of cream ( heavy whipping creme or creme fraiche)\n1 table spoon of cognac\n1 table spoon of chopped parsley.\nsalt and pepper to season.\n\nto white cook the button mushroom:\nwater 1 table spoon of butter \none squeeze of lemon juice\n\nThis vol au vent recipe has everything you would ever expect from a French classic dish. Personally I like to describe it as an elegantly old-fashioned starter fit for Kings.\n\n\n\nWe will see in details how to make a type of veloute called the \u201cParisian sauce. and create the Vol au vent filling called: \"a la reine\u201d which is composed of a Salpicon (diced pieces) of chicken and forest mushrooms.(chicken mushroom veloute sauce)\n\n\nA bit of history:\nWith the pastry chefs of the court of Versailles, the queen of France Marie Leszczynska (1703-1768), daughter of Stanislas Leszczynski, king of Poland, would be the historical origin of this traditional recipe of French gastronomy. Inspired by pastries made from sweet puff pastry like the wells of love created by Vincent La Chapelle made for her rival Madame de Pompadour, she would have looked for aphrodisiac dishes  and asked Nicolas Stohrer to create a salty version to regain the favors of Louis XV, her husband.\n\n\n\nsupport my work on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/frenchcookingacademy\n\nDiscuss this on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchcookingacademy/\n\nThe one and only cast iron dutch oven I use:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k7w5K7\n\nMy favorite frying pan:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k4wIUx\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttps://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nWebsite for text, print friendly recipe\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************\nTo support the channel:\nGet the Cookware I am using and more:\nhttps://goo.gl/krYqny\n\n****************************",

Inspired by pastries made from sweet puff pastry like the wells of love created by Vincent La Chapelle made for her rival Madame de Pompadour, she would have looked for aphrodisiac dishes  and asked Nicolas Stohrer to create a salty version to regain the favors of Louis XV, her husband.\n\n\n\nsupport my work on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/frenchcookingacademy\n\nDiscuss this on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchcookingacademy/\n\nThe one and only cast iron dutch oven I use:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k7w5K7\n\nMy favorite frying pan:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k4wIUx\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttps://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nWebsite for text, print friendly recipe\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************\nTo support the channel:\nGet the Cookware I am using and more:\nhttps://goo.gl/krYqny\n\n****************************"

( as we do in France)\n\nIn this lemon tart ( tarte au citron) tutorial we will learn how to make a classic lemon custard cream (creme au citron). this particularly smooth filling and buttery filling goes very well with meringue too.\n\nOne great thing about that recipe is that the juice can be replaced by other Fruit juice such as orange or tangerines for instance which then transform that dessert into a Orange or Tangerine tart.( Note that in this case the sugar amounts have to be modified accordingly)\n\n\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\n\nTo make that delicious classic French style Lemon tart you will need the following ingredients:\n\n- 1 pre-cooked tart shell made with around 200 grams of \n   homemade sweet shortcrust  pastry.\n\n\nFor the Lemon custard cream filling:\n\n- 300 ml of fresh lemon juice ( it has freshly squeezed juice)\n- 150 grams of caster sugar ( to mix with the lemon juice)\n- 100 ml of water ( optional)\n- 3 whole eggs\n- 3 eggs yolks\n- 50 grams of caster sugar ( to mix with the eggs)\n- 25 grams of corn flour.\n- a few drops of vanilla essence\n- 200 ml of heavy whipping cream\n- 70 gram of butter\n\nUtensils I used:\nSilicon Mat:\nhttps://amzn.to/2rvyRcX\nCeramic Pie weight:\nhttps://amzn.to/2KTs3xP\nTarte Pan:\nhttps://amzn.to/2jNbXcJ\n\n\nImportant note: The quality of the ingredients in this recipe is paramount. The eggs, butter, cream and Lemon juice have to be fresh of the best quality.\n\n- The lemon juice has to be freshly squeeze or your tart will not taste as it should.\n\n- This version of the Lemon tart is a very Lemony version ( it will have a sharp lemon taste). However you can tone that down by replacing 100 ml of Lemon juice by water. ( so 200 ml of Freshly squeezed lemon juice mixed with 100 ml of water)\n\n\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\n\nsupport my work on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/frenchcookingacademy\n\nDiscuss this on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchcookingacademy/\n\nThe one and only cast iron dutch oven I use:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k7w5K7\n\nMy favorite frying pan:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k4wIUx\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttps://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nWebsite for text, print friendly recipe\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************\nTo support the channel:\nGet the Cookware I am using and more:\nhttps://goo.gl/krYqny\n\n****************************",

( as we do in France)\n\nIn this lemon tart ( tarte au citron) tutorial we will learn how to make a classic lemon custard cream (creme au citron). this particularly smooth filling and buttery filling goes very well with meringue too.\n\nOne great thing about that recipe is that the juice can be replaced by other Fruit juice such as orange or tangerines for instance which then transform that dessert into a Orange or Tangerine tart.( Note that in this case the sugar amounts have to be modified accordingly)\n\n\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\n\nTo make that delicious classic French style Lemon tart you will need the following ingredients:\n\n- 1 pre-cooked tart shell made with around 200 grams of \n   homemade sweet shortcrust  pastry.\n\n\nFor the Lemon custard cream filling:\n\n- 300 ml of fresh lemon juice ( it has freshly squeezed juice)\n- 150 grams of caster sugar ( to mix with the lemon juice)\n- 100 ml of water ( optional)\n- 3 whole eggs\n- 3 eggs yolks\n- 50 grams of caster sugar ( to mix with the eggs)\n- 25 grams of corn flour.\n- a few drops of vanilla essence\n- 200 ml of heavy whipping cream\n- 70 gram of butter\n\nUtensils I used:\nSilicon Mat:\nhttps://amzn.to/2rvyRcX\nCeramic Pie weight:\nhttps://amzn.to/2KTs3xP\nTarte Pan:\nhttps://amzn.to/2jNbXcJ\n\n\nImportant note: The quality of the ingredients in this recipe is paramount. The eggs, butter, cream and Lemon juice have to be fresh of the best quality.\n\n- The lemon juice has to be freshly squeeze or your tart will not taste as it should.\n\n- This version of the Lemon tart is a very Lemony version ( it will have a sharp lemon taste). However you can tone that down by replacing 100 ml of Lemon juice by water. ( so 200 ml of Freshly squeezed lemon juice mixed with 100 ml of water)\n\n\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf4b\n\nsupport my work on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/frenchcookingacademy\n\nDiscuss this on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchcookingacademy/\n\nThe one and only cast iron dutch oven I use:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k7w5K7\n\nMy favorite frying pan:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k4wIUx\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttps://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nWebsite for text, print friendly recipe\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************\nTo support the channel:\nGet the Cookware I am using and more:\nhttps://goo.gl/krYqny\n\n****************************"

DO NOT let the temptation to turn up the heat to try to hurry the process, as rushing the process will ruin the flavor and texture of the chocolate.\n\nBreak up, grate, or chop the chocolate into small pieces.  The chocolate will melt fast and more easily if you do this.\n\nUse a rubber spatula, not a metal or wooden spoon to stir the chocolate (wood can retain moisture).  Use only rubber spatulas that have not been exposed to strong flavors such as tomato sauce or garlic.\n\nAlways melt chocolate slowly, at a low temperature.  The melting point of chocolate is between 86 degrees F. (30 degrees C.) and 90 degrees F. (32 degrees C.), lower than body temperature.\n\nUsing high heat is very risky and the most common cause of grainy and/or lumpy chocolate.  Chocolate melts better and faster when using lower temperatures.  Never let the temperature of your chocolate get above 115 degrees F.  Milk and white chocolates, which are more heat sensitive, should not be heated above 110 degrees F.  Use an instant-read thermometer to check the chocolate\u2019s temperature while melting.\n   \n***********************************************************\n\nsupport my work on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/frenchcookingacademy\n\nDiscuss this on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchcookingacademy/\n\nThe one and only cast iron dutch oven I use:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k7w5K7\n\nMy favorite frying pan:\nhttps://amzn.to/2k4wIUx\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttps://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nWebsite for text, print friendly recipe\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************\nTo support the channel:\nGet the Cookware I am using and more:\nhttps://goo.gl/krYqny\n\n****************************",

Cook them thick and you will more an apple cake that can be bakes in a pan\n\nIngredients:\n200 gr of plain flour\n2 whole eggs\n100 gr of caster sugar\n25o ml of full cream milk\n4 or 5 apples (optional).\n3 tablespoons of oil\n3 tablespoons of apple or pear liquor\n1 pinch of salt\n\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttp://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nWebsite for text, print friendly recipe\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************\nTo support the channel:\nGet the Cookware I am using and more:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/thefrenchcookingacademy\n\n****************************",

Of the course the French version differs from its American counterpart but uses similar ingredients with the addition of Butter cream and garlic.\nThere are many variants to this dish in France, some of which do use some flour with the milk to add thickness to the sauce or some other version that have addition of ham cube bacon or onions. \nThe cheese used in France is usually the Emmental cheese but the Macaroni and cheese recipe can be made with a wide array of other French cheese too. Personally I would say that the best cheeses to use are the one that give you that nice strings of cheese effect.\n\n\n\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttp://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nWebsite for text, print friendly recipe\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************\nTo support the channel:\nGet the Cookware I am using and more:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/thefrenchcookingacademy\n\n****************************",

Of the course the French version differs from its American counterpart but uses similar ingredients with the addition of Butter cream and garlic.\nThere are many variants to this dish in France, some of which do use some flour with the milk to add thickness to the sauce or some other version that have addition of ham cube bacon or onions. \nThe cheese used in France is usually the Emmental cheese but the Macaroni and cheese recipe can be made with a wide array of other French cheese too. Personally I would say that the best cheeses to use are the one that give you that nice strings of cheese effect.\n\n\n\n\n****************************\nOnline food converter:\nhttp://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/cooking/\n\n****************************\nWebsite for text, print friendly recipe\nhttps://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n****************************\nTo support the channel:\nGet the Cookware I am using and more:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/thefrenchcookingacademy\n\n****************************"

Well this is part of the new and stricter Youtube rules that have taken effect recently.\n\nIn this video I discuss what happen to my cooking video and how did  successfully request for YouTube to remove the yellow dollar icon and the infamous \"limited or no ads\" status. \n\nI would like to mention that as of 2017 it is advisable to all small channel (even cooking channels) to be very careful of what you write in your titles, tags,thumbnails and description as amongst other things your video could be flagged with copyright issues.\n\n\n*********************\nSupport the channel by shopping for cookware and books on my Amazon page:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/thefrenchcookingacademy\n*******************\n(the book I am in the video is available in the store)",

                    "description": "My New Cooking Series Flagged Down By The New YouTube Algorithm:\n\nLast week Just after I launched a new cooking series called: \"Let's talk about michelin star recipes\" I quickly realized that talking about well known chefs and their recipes was not really welcome by the new Youtube algorithm.\n\nMy second video quickly got the yellow dollar sign treatment and the limited or no ads sentences that everyone fears appeared along with it.\n\nWhen this happens your video will not be monetized and could potentially even be blocked.\n\nBut why was my cooking video marked down and blacklisted by the youtube algorithm( 2017) ?  Well this is part of the new and stricter Youtube rules that have taken effect recently.\n\nIn this video I discuss what happen to my cooking video and how did  successfully request for YouTube to remove the yellow dollar icon and the infamous \"limited or no ads\" status. \n\nI would like to mention that as of 2017 it is advisable to all small channel (even cooking channels) to be very careful of what you write in your titles, tags,thumbnails and description as amongst other things your video could be flagged with copyright issues.\n\n\n*********************\nSupport the channel by shopping for cookware and books on my Amazon page:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/thefrenchcookingacademy\n*******************\n(the book I am in the video is available in the store)"

However if you cut is thinner it will not take that long so be carefull\n\n\nBest to use a frying pan like this one:\nhttp://amzn.to/2pyW8ue",

                    "description": "BECOME A STUDENT OF OUR FRENCH ONLINE CULINARY SCHOOL TODAY! https://bit.ly/2KKgv1A The red wine sauce I am making today is not a bordelaise but the common Red wine sauce made in French bistro. \n\nIn france we call it the \"Sauce Marchand de vin\" which translate in to the wine maker sauce or wine merchant sauce. it gets its name for its simple and quick preparation that can by be done by anyone and also for its hearty / down to earth style  which could be compared to a good winemaker.\n\nwhat ever the story is, it is a delicious little sauce that I strongly recommend you try.\n\nIngredients and recipe on my website:\nhttps://www.thefrenchcookingacademy.com/recipe/steak-red-wine-sauce/\n\ntips for cooking the meat: depending on how thick your piece of meat is you will have to time accordingly. but as a rough guide start by browning each side of the meat for 2 minutes on high heat. after that reduce the heat to medium low and let the meat cook further.\nMy thick piece of meat took 12 minutes in total for a medium rare. However if you cut is thinner it will not take that long so be carefull\n\n\nBest to use a frying pan like this one:\nhttp://amzn.to/2pyW8ue"

No sugar, no flour, vinegars or wines,\njust good quality butter, onions and beef or veal stock. to top it up\nof course you will have to use a French style baguette and some gruyere or comte cheese (I use comte cheese in this video). if you are vegetarian yes you can use vegetable stock instead but the taste will not be the same.",

Get the recipe: https://bit.ly/3I0SAqg\n\nHow to make your own bouquet garni:\nhttps://youtu.be/V35qP2dEywg\n\nIn order to make an onion soup the way its done in France, you have to\nkeep things simple. No sugar, no flour, vinegars or wines,\njust good quality butter, onions and beef or veal stock. to top it up\nof course you will have to use a French style baguette and some gruyere or comte cheese (I use comte cheese in this video). if you are vegetarian yes you can use vegetable stock instead but the taste will not be the same."

There are many variants that exist so feel free to add more vegetables but refrain form using, tomatoes, starchy vegetables, and any vegetables that would color your stock (like beetroot for example)\n\nin this video I used:\n\n1 Leek\n3 Turnips\n2 Carrots\nHalf a celery\na freshly made bouquet garni\nhalf an onion\n5 cloves\na pinch of rock salt and a few black peppercorns",

There are many variants that exist so feel free to add more vegetables but refrain form using, tomatoes, starchy vegetables, and any vegetables that would color your stock (like beetroot for example)\n\nin this video I used:\n\n1 Leek\n3 Turnips\n2 Carrots\nHalf a celery\na freshly made bouquet garni\nhalf an onion\n5 cloves\na pinch of rock salt and a few black peppercorns"

                "description": "making an eating crepes is something we do a lot in France. here is guide that cover all the steps from beginning to end from how to make the crepes and what filling to use to enjoy them.\n\n\nHow to choose a crepe pan:\n******************************* \n- First and foremost the size of a  crepe pan must be around 10 inch or 26 cm in diameter.\n\n- Next It has to be lightweight!  making 50 to 100 crepes in a row trust me is not an easy task and using a cast iron or steel pan (as fancy as it looks) will have you stop using such a pan very quickly. so the lighter the pan the better. \n\n- Comfort is next. a good old sturdy large plastic handle that fits well in the hand is what I prefer as it does not get hot and provide you with a great grip for flipping the crepes. \n\nEdges of the pan. a crepe pan is not an omelette pan, the edges of the pan must be extremely low profile to allow the crepe to slide off easily when flipping the crepes.\n\nFinally regarding pan brands, get a reasonably decent brand with a good warranty in case something goes wrong. crepe  pans can be damaged quickly and you should not invest too much in such specialty pans, as you will not be using it everyday.\n\nin this video I am using a Debuyer crepe pan because that was a present from someone. it is a good quality pan but I really don't like the handle as it is absolutely not comfortable an gets really hot after extensive use. that said the durability is there and I have been using that pan many times and the non stick still did not scratch\n\nIf i have to recommend a pan I would get that one:\nhttps://amzn.to/2J8Gtgm\n\nThe pan I am using in this video:\nhttps://amzn.to/2LiS3C0\n\n\nThis is the video for you if you want know how to make French crepes. Learn everything from making the batter, tossing the crepes and eat them. I also show some of the most common ways of eating and folding Crepes the way we do it back in France. but that said, crepes are a bit of personal thing and everyone enjoy finding new ways of making the batter in a slightly different way every time. Just add your special ingredient and make them your own way!\n\nShare the love and organize a fun crepe day with your friends and family.\n\nEnjoy",

                    "description": "making an eating crepes is something we do a lot in France. here is guide that cover all the steps from beginning to end from how to make the crepes and what filling to use to enjoy them.\n\n\nHow to choose a crepe pan:\n******************************* \n- First and foremost the size of a  crepe pan must be around 10 inch or 26 cm in diameter.\n\n- Next It has to be lightweight!  making 50 to 100 crepes in a row trust me is not an easy task and using a cast iron or steel pan (as fancy as it looks) will have you stop using such a pan very quickly. so the lighter the pan the better. \n\n- Comfort is next. a good old sturdy large plastic handle that fits well in the hand is what I prefer as it does not get hot and provide you with a great grip for flipping the crepes. \n\nEdges of the pan. a crepe pan is not an omelette pan, the edges of the pan must be extremely low profile to allow the crepe to slide off easily when flipping the crepes.\n\nFinally regarding pan brands, get a reasonably decent brand with a good warranty in case something goes wrong. crepe  pans can be damaged quickly and you should not invest too much in such specialty pans, as you will not be using it everyday.\n\nin this video I am using a Debuyer crepe pan because that was a present from someone. it is a good quality pan but I really don't like the handle as it is absolutely not comfortable an gets really hot after extensive use. that said the durability is there and I have been using that pan many times and the non stick still did not scratch\n\nIf i have to recommend a pan I would get that one:\nhttps://amzn.to/2J8Gtgm\n\nThe pan I am using in this video:\nhttps://amzn.to/2LiS3C0\n\n\nThis is the video for you if you want know how to make French crepes. Learn everything from making the batter, tossing the crepes and eat them. I also show some of the most common ways of eating and folding Crepes the way we do it back in France. but that said, crepes are a bit of personal thing and everyone enjoy finding new ways of making the batter in a slightly different way every time. Just add your special ingredient and make them your own way!\n\nShare the love and organize a fun crepe day with your friends and family.\n\nEnjoy"

Yes you can shout hot, hot, hot\nIf you smell gas always check the stove\nIf oil or soap liquid spills on the floor it can cause a nasty slip, trip or fall accident. Clean it up with hot water immediately\nAlways keep floors clear and dry at all times\nDon't throw broken glass in the rubbish without wrapping it up\nNever plug or unplug electrical cords with wet hands\nDo not take a hot glass dish from the oven and put on a wet surface or in cold water.\nNever overload your electrical circuits\nAlways check equipment before leaving at nights. Make sure the stove, the grill and whatever else is there is turned off."
