The Issue was, outside of the internet I had no personal experience with the British version so I set out to sample the Welsh Rarebit in person!\u00a0\n\nIn this episode of the sandwich series, join Mike as he ventures out into NYC to a british restaurant called Tea and Sympathy to sample his first welsh rarebit made from scratch by the owner herself! After a brief interview to gather as much information as possible, Mike will head back to his home kitchen to make his first Welsh Rarebit completely from scratch. Once accomplished and satisfied with his homemade version,\u00a0he will whip up a quick grill cheese sandwich for a final showdown between the two to solve the debate\u2026 Welsh Rarebit or American Grilled Cheese?\n\nCheck out the blog post for detailed recipe and video breakdown  - \nhttps://prohomecooks.com/recipes/the-battle-of-the-best-cheese-sandwich-\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7-vs-\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8/\n\nFor complete detailed sandwich bread recipes, check out my Ultimate Bread Handbook (free PDF) https://www.sourdoughu.com/bread-book\n\nVideo Credits \nCreator & Host - Mike G @lifebymikeg\nHead Editor - Rachel @rambelang\n\nAll music provided royalty free by epidemic sound",

The Issue was, outside of the internet I had no personal experience with the British version so I set out to sample the Welsh Rarebit in person!\u00a0\n\nIn this episode of the sandwich series, join Mike as he ventures out into NYC to a british restaurant called Tea and Sympathy to sample his first welsh rarebit made from scratch by the owner herself! After a brief interview to gather as much information as possible, Mike will head back to his home kitchen to make his first Welsh Rarebit completely from scratch. Once accomplished and satisfied with his homemade version,\u00a0he will whip up a quick grill cheese sandwich for a final showdown between the two to solve the debate\u2026 Welsh Rarebit or American Grilled Cheese?\n\nCheck out the blog post for detailed recipe and video breakdown  - \nhttps://prohomecooks.com/recipes/the-battle-of-the-best-cheese-sandwich-\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7-vs-\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8/\n\nFor complete detailed sandwich bread recipes, check out my Ultimate Bread Handbook (free PDF) https://www.sourdoughu.com/bread-book\n\nVideo Credits \nCreator & Host - Mike G @lifebymikeg\nHead Editor - Rachel @rambelang\n\nAll music provided royalty free by epidemic sound"

Luckily my Napoleon Grill from @napoleonproducts came just in time to take this dinner to the next level because if theres one thing better then fresh pita, it\u2019s fresh pita hot off the grill.\n\nCheck out all Napoleons incredible line of grills\nhttps://www.napoleon.com/en/us/grills\nMy Charcoal Professional Grill by Napoleon (featured in this video) \n https://www.bbqguys.com/napoleon/professional-freestanding-charcoal-grill\n\n-Menu- \n00:00 - Intro \n02:42 - Spiced Chicken \n04:09 - Fresh Pita Bread \n06:30 - Lemon Potatoes \n11:03 - Hummus \n13:27 - Roasted Green Peppers \n\nFor the detailed recipes check out the blog post! https://www.prohomecooks.com/post/how-to-go-to-dinner-while-staying-in \n\nFollow me on instagram @lifebymikeG for behind the scenes action \n\nAll Music Provided Royalty Free by Epidemic Sound"

I am doing the highly requested vada pav. It is a street food staple in India that is carb heavy (who doesn't love carbs?) so it can fuel you throughout the day. It's packed with tons of different flavors coming from the three different chutneys all stuffed into a super soft butter roll. But before I make everything from scratch I head over to Desi Galli to get a behind the scenes look on the key ingredients that make this sandwich special. \n\nCheck out the blog post for detailed recipe and video breakdown  - \nhttps://prohomecooks.com/recipes/sandwich-rollvada-pav/\n\n00:00 - Intro \n5:55 - Milk Buns \n12:06 - Tamarind Chutney \n13:03 - Green Chutney \n14:35 - Dried Garlic Chutney \n\nFor more information on the Fiilex track lighting system, click this link. \nhttp://fiilex.com/products/CinematicLighting.php\n\nCheck out all the detailed recipes from this video: \nhttps://www.prohomecooks.com/post/sandwich-series-vada-pav\n\nWatch season 1 of the sandwich series here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\nFollow me on instagram @lifebymikeg for behind the scenes action! \n\nAll Music Provided Royalty Free By Epidemic Sound",

I am doing the highly requested vada pav. It is a street food staple in India that is carb heavy (who doesn't love carbs?) so it can fuel you throughout the day. It's packed with tons of different flavors coming from the three different chutneys all stuffed into a super soft butter roll. But before I make everything from scratch I head over to Desi Galli to get a behind the scenes look on the key ingredients that make this sandwich special. \n\nCheck out the blog post for detailed recipe and video breakdown  - \nhttps://prohomecooks.com/recipes/sandwich-rollvada-pav/\n\n00:00 - Intro \n5:55 - Milk Buns \n12:06 - Tamarind Chutney \n13:03 - Green Chutney \n14:35 - Dried Garlic Chutney \n\nFor more information on the Fiilex track lighting system, click this link. \nhttp://fiilex.com/products/CinematicLighting.php\n\nCheck out all the detailed recipes from this video: \nhttps://www.prohomecooks.com/post/sandwich-series-vada-pav\n\nWatch season 1 of the sandwich series here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\nFollow me on instagram @lifebymikeg for behind the scenes action! \n\nAll Music Provided Royalty Free By Epidemic Sound"

Cooking steak was a huge skill to learn in the early days on my culinary journey, especially when I was throwing dinner parties for my friends at Uni. Master steak preparation, and you're well on your way to becoming a pro home cook. \n\nEpisode 1 -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCVTOa01uN8\nEpisode 2 -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bN_crxaVsg\n\nProHomeCooks.com \nFollow me at @lifebymikeg on Instagram  \nHelp support Pro Home Cooks! - https://www.patreon.com/KitchenStudio\n\nMusic Provided Royalty Free by Epidemic Sound"

I will talk to some experts, learn a little history and craft each dessert completely from scratch in my home kitchen all to satisfy my sweet tooth! \n\nEpisode one is all about a Japanese festive snack called the Taiyaki, originally created for good fortune. The snack was created over a century ago but it recently has exploded on the scene due to a  social media Taiyaki storm which I learn all about in episode 1. \n\nIf you have a \"Sweet Idea\" you want top contribute to this season, private message me on Instagram @lifebymikeG \nIm leveling up my videos by creating a new kitchen studio from scratch!

I will talk to some experts, learn a little history and craft each dessert completely from scratch in my home kitchen all to satisfy my sweet tooth! \n\nEpisode one is all about a Japanese festive snack called the Taiyaki, originally created for good fortune. The snack was created over a century ago but it recently has exploded on the scene due to a  social media Taiyaki storm which I learn all about in episode 1. \n\nIf you have a \"Sweet Idea\" you want top contribute to this season, private message me on Instagram @lifebymikeG \nIm leveling up my videos by creating a new kitchen studio from scratch!

This sandwich is found all over the streets of Argentina and is usually served up simply with just three elements. One thing that really attracted to me this sandwich was the unique style of Chorizo that I attempt to make this is video! Stay tuned for episode 5 coming soon and please remember to comment in below with the sandwich you would like to see in this series.\n#Chorip\u00e1n #homemadesausage\n\nWatch episode 1-3 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvuzgBkElQo&list=PLt_lOWx8jR_NUv2YGsUwscbv34VOGPYb3\n\n6:45 Homemade Argentine Chorizo \nIngredients:\n- Ground Pork Belly (1 pounds)\n- Ground Pork (2 pounds)\n- Malbec (2 cups)\n- Garlics(1 bulbs)\n- Black Pepper (1 tablespoon)\n- Paprika (1 \u00bd tablespoon) \n- Salt (1 tablespoon)\n\nSteps:\n1. If you don\u2019t have a meat grinder at home, you can put your pork belly in the freezer for 30-45 minutes. It\u2019s going to be firm, but not frozen so it\u2019s easy to slice it and cut it into very very very small chunks and use that in place of ground meat.\n2.

This sandwich is found all over the streets of Argentina and is usually served up simply with just three elements. One thing that really attracted to me this sandwich was the unique style of Chorizo that I attempt to make this is video! Stay tuned for episode 5 coming soon and please remember to comment in below with the sandwich you would like to see in this series.\n#Chorip\u00e1n #homemadesausage\n\nWatch episode 1-3 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvuzgBkElQo&list=PLt_lOWx8jR_NUv2YGsUwscbv34VOGPYb3\n\n6:45 Homemade Argentine Chorizo \nIngredients:\n- Ground Pork Belly (1 pounds)\n- Ground Pork (2 pounds)\n- Malbec (2 cups)\n- Garlics(1 bulbs)\n- Black Pepper (1 tablespoon)\n- Paprika (1 \u00bd tablespoon) \n- Salt (1 tablespoon)\n\nSteps:\n1. If you don\u2019t have a meat grinder at home, you can put your pork belly in the freezer for 30-45 minutes. It\u2019s going to be firm, but not frozen so it\u2019s easy to slice it and cut it into very very very small chunks and use that in place of ground meat.\n2. Pour the malbec and a whole bulb of garlic (cut in half) into a sauce pan, and let that simmer for about 15 minutes. \n3. When the wine, garlic mixture cool down; take out the garlic cloves and chop them into little pieces. \n4.

The club sandwich is one one of those special sandwiches that fills me up with nostalgia and still holds up even in this trendy food climate that we currently live in. Growing up, I always enjoyed my club sandwiches with a Shirley Temple (obviously non-alcoholic of course) so I thought it would be a great opportunity to snaz one up a bit with some Smirnoff vodka and create the adult version! #SmirnoffPartner #Sandwichseries #clubsandwich\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW: https://www.youtube.com/user/BrothersGreenEats?sub_confirmation=1\n\n-Recipes- \n\nDrink Ingredients:\nShirley temple Recipe\n1.5 oz Smirnoff No 21 Vodka\n2 oz - Lemon lime soda or Gingerale \n2 oz Soda water\n1 oz Grenadine\n1 -3 Maraschino cherries (or 10 if you\u2019re lucky) \nWedge of lime (optional) \n\nHome Cured Bacon (Salt method)\nIngredients:\nPork Belly\nSalt  (lot of it)\nBlack Pepper\n\nSteps:\n1. Take out your pork belly, and cover it with lots of salt.\n2. Let it sit in the room temperature for about 12-24 hours, the longer it sit the saltier it will be.\n3. When it\u2019s ready, brush out the salt on pork belly.\n4. Season the pork belly with some black peppers.\n5. Get a string and tie up your seasoned salted pork belly and hang it in the fridge to dry out and cure. \n6. Let it cure in the fridge for 2-4 weeks until the belly lost a good amount of the moisture. \n7. Now you have homemade bacon! Enjoy!\n\nBroiled Bacon\nIngredients:\nBacon\nOil\n\nSteps:\n1. Grab a sheet pan with some tinfoil and a little bit of oil to make it non-stick.\n2. Lay out your bacon on the sheet pan and throw it into the oven under the broiler. \n3. Let that get nice and crispy and don\u2019t forget to turn them so both side can get crispy. \n4. Enjoy!\n\n\nDeli Style Chicken Meat\nIngredients:\nChicken Breast (2)\nSalt\nBlack Pepper\nCoriander Seeds\nChilis\nRaw Garlic (2 cloves)\nWater\n\nSteps:\n1. Stack your chicken breast together, make sure the thick side and the thin side are stacked. So it\u2019s a nice even thick strip. \n2.  Grab a string and start roping the stacked chicken breast. The main goal is to tight up into one piece. \n3. Let\u2019s make a brine: Take out a saucepan, add in some salt, pepper, coriander seeds, chilies, garlic, and water. Bring that up to a simmer so everything is dissolved. \n4. Add in some ice cubes to the pot to cool down the brine.\n5. Add your tied up chicken into the brine and put it in the fridge to sit overnight. \n6. Simmer the chicken in the brine in 160-170\u00b0F for 20 minutes until it\u2019s cooked through. 160\u00b0F for the internal temperature. \n7. Slice your chicken breast and let the meats cool off overnight in the fridge. \n\nHomemade Mayo\nIngredients:\nEggs (1)\nOil\nSalt\nLemon (\u00bd ) \n\nSteps:\n1. Crack a whole egg into your mixing bowl, and start whisking and add in oil very slowly, little by little.\n2. Whisking that up until it starts emulsifying and thickening into mayo consistency.\n3. Season the mayo: add in some salt, a tiny bit of lemon zest, and a squeeze of lemon juice.\n4. Whisk again with all the seasoning, and pour it into a jar.

(No matter how busy your schedule is)  \n\n\"Mike's Break the Fast Salad\"\n\nOver the last few months, I\u2019ve been enjoying the life style change of intermittent fasting. For those who have no idea what that is, basically you choose extended periods of time to fast from food. Some people fast for full days a few times a week, and other fast for a certain amount of time per day. I personally fast for 16 hours a day and eat for 8 hours, so for my lifestyle, I stop eating at 8pm at night and start back up at noon the next day. There seems to be a dulling effect on food in correlation to living in a world filled with instant access to pretty much any type of food we want. Fasting forces me into not falling slave to the instant access of food and in reward I get to appreciate food again on a more intense level.\n\nOne beneficial side effect that I have found from fasting is that each and every day I tend to break my fast with something well-crafted and healthy. Being a cook, it is so easy for me to constantly be picking at the things I am making, and I am making food all the time! So by fasting, I get time to think about and create bigger meals that I am craving, and what I am craving, is usually some version of a mega salad. It makes sense that after not eating for 16 hours, I pretty much want everything I can get in one single bowl.\n\nThe key to making salads edible is adding little treats to them that create a distractions away from all the greens. By adding these little sourdough croutons treats, I can guarantee you that you wont be thinking about the all the healthy greens you are taking down!\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW: https://www.youtube.com/user/BrothersGreenEats?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Brothers Green Eats\nInstagram: \nBrothers Green - https://www.instagram.com/brothersgreen\nJosh - https://www.instagram.com/youenjoylife/\nMike - https://www.instagram.com/lifebymikeg/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nJosh and Mike Greenfield make up Brothers Green Eats, a dynamic and brotherly duo that can teach anyone to cook creative and delicious food on a budget.",

Follow me on Insta for glorious eating tips: http://bit.ly/2Ahq2F4\nAnd be sure to head on over and listen to J. Fla's \"Havana\" cover here: http://bit.ly/JFlaHavana\n\nThe Incredible Edible Ten Breakdown\nI'm gonna be honest, I rarely cook specific \"dishes,\" I find it to be a bit of a waste of ingredients, and it often gets boring. I'd much rather spend that same amount of time prepping a few simple ingredients so that I can have almost endless variation. Ever since I figured this out, it has been a total game changer in the kitchen. \n\nKeep in mind that you can use these categories for nearly any cuisine, I am sharing a few things that I like to get in each category, but you can keep it as simple or complex as you want. \n\n1. Fresh: Lettuce, Cucumber, Carrots, Broccoli\n2. Protein: Chicken, Tofu, Eggs, Beans\n3. Spice: Chili, Hot Sauce, Sriracha, Cayenne\n4. Main Batch: Curry, Chili, Soup\n5. Crispy/Crunchy: Peanuts, Fried Shallots, Other Nuts\n6. Starch: Rice, Rice Noodles, Other Noodles, Potatoes\n7. Umami: Garlic Soy, Umami Powder, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, Thai Dressing\n8. Herb: Cilantro, Scallions, Mint\n9. Citrus: Lime\n10. Pickled: Pickled Daikon and Carrots, Chili Vinegar\n\nThere is a bonus 11th that I realized should be included depending on the cuisine, that is sweet. In my case I had sweet in some of the other elements, like the umami dressing, so I didn't include it as its own category, but ideally, you'd want sweet if you like it in your savory foods.\n\nAll other music courtesy of Blue Wednesday\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday",

Follow me on Insta for glorious eating tips: http://bit.ly/2Ahq2F4\nAnd be sure to head on over and listen to J. Fla's \"Havana\" cover here: http://bit.ly/JFlaHavana\n\nThe Incredible Edible Ten Breakdown\nI'm gonna be honest, I rarely cook specific \"dishes,\" I find it to be a bit of a waste of ingredients, and it often gets boring. I'd much rather spend that same amount of time prepping a few simple ingredients so that I can have almost endless variation. Ever since I figured this out, it has been a total game changer in the kitchen. \n\nKeep in mind that you can use these categories for nearly any cuisine, I am sharing a few things that I like to get in each category, but you can keep it as simple or complex as you want. \n\n1. Fresh: Lettuce, Cucumber, Carrots, Broccoli\n2. Protein: Chicken, Tofu, Eggs, Beans\n3. Spice: Chili, Hot Sauce, Sriracha, Cayenne\n4. Main Batch: Curry, Chili, Soup\n5. Crispy/Crunchy: Peanuts, Fried Shallots, Other Nuts\n6. Starch: Rice, Rice Noodles, Other Noodles, Potatoes\n7. Umami: Garlic Soy, Umami Powder, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, Thai Dressing\n8. Herb: Cilantro, Scallions, Mint\n9. Citrus: Lime\n10. Pickled: Pickled Daikon and Carrots, Chili Vinegar\n\nThere is a bonus 11th that I realized should be included depending on the cuisine, that is sweet. In my case I had sweet in some of the other elements, like the umami dressing, so I didn't include it as its own category, but ideally, you'd want sweet if you like it in your savory foods.\n\nAll other music courtesy of Blue Wednesday\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday"

We all know how quickly the cost of eating out adds up, and when you break down the finances, a simple investment in groceries once or twice a week can save you a ton of money in the long run. This is why I'm challenging all of you to the #packlunchpact  - It\u2019s time to switch up your daily routine and get the incredible rewards of cooking your homemade food and bringing it with you to work, school, or even when you just leave the house for a few hours. It\u2019s pretty rare that I ever leave the house these days without bringing some type of homemade treat because when I pack my own food to go, not only do I save a ton of money, but the reward of eating my homemade yummy food made with love, trumps anything I would get in a store! It can be a little strange at first, but the more you do it, the more it become second nature and part of your everyday lifestyle.\n\nI'm leveling up my videos by creating a new kitchen studio completely from scratch!

We all know how quickly the cost of eating out adds up, and when you break down the finances, a simple investment in groceries once or twice a week can save you a ton of money in the long run. This is why I'm challenging all of you to the #packlunchpact  - It\u2019s time to switch up your daily routine and get the incredible rewards of cooking your homemade food and bringing it with you to work, school, or even when you just leave the house for a few hours. It\u2019s pretty rare that I ever leave the house these days without bringing some type of homemade treat because when I pack my own food to go, not only do I save a ton of money, but the reward of eating my homemade yummy food made with love, trumps anything I would get in a store! It can be a little strange at first, but the more you do it, the more it become second nature and part of your everyday lifestyle.\n\nI'm leveling up my videos by creating a new kitchen studio completely from scratch!

Click Here to download it now:  http://bit.ly/SourdoughEbook\n\nWhen it comes to making incredible tasting food, the journey is never-ending. Every single time I get in the kitchen to cook, there is always something I can learn or improve on and all it really takes to do that is paying attention! Cooking is about being intuitive and this series will break down all the tips, skills and techniques that i've picked up on my 8 year journey of being intuitive in the kitchen! \n#beginner #cookingtips #stirfry\n\nIf you've been a Brothers Green subscriber for years, I'm sure many of these tips are already in your arsenal. but like I said before, I'm constantly learning so there's always some new cooking love to spread around!\n\nRecipe: \n\nChicken and Veggie Stir-Fry\nMeat (chicken)\nSalt\nSeasoning\nCooking Oil\nMushrooms\nOnions\nZucchini\nSpinach\nChili\nGarlic\nGinger\nFermented Soy Sauce\nSesame Oil\nRice Vinegar\nSesame Seeds\nGarnish\n\nDry meat with a paper towel. A lot of chicken that come packaged come with extra liquid. This can be unfavorable when trying to fry up the chicken as the meat will not absorb the flavors if the meat is wet.\nEven out meat. Place the meat in a zip lock bag and pound it out until it is even.\nCoat with plenty of salt and seasoning. Many times foods will taste plain if it doesn\u2019t have enough seasoning. Also, allow the seasoned meat to sit for at least 10 minutes. Place the seasoned meat in fridge so it can dry out and the salt will help it dry out too. This will enhance the flavors of the seasoning. Give it another pat dry if a little bit of liquid is released while letting it sit.\nControl the heat of your pan. There are a different range of heat settings (low, medium, high). You control the heat based on how the foods are cooking.\nMake sure you have enough oil or fat in the pan so things cook properly and don\u2019t get burned. If you\u2019re worried about consuming too much fat from oils it is suggested to get healthy cooking oil. \nPreheat pan before you add oil. If you add oil before heating up pan then the oil will degrade. Add chicken to the pan and let it cook at a medium-low heat.  Let it cook for about 4 minutes until a white ring starts to form around the chicken. Flip it over and let it cook for a little less amount of time. In this case, for about 2-3 minutes on the other side. \nPull meat early and wrap it up in some tin foil as it will cook a little more in the tin foil.\nLet the meat sit and do NOT waste the juice from the cooked meat. Letting the meat sit for a few minutes will allow the meat to absorb the juice. Save the meat juice for later on to add to your dish.\nPrep your veggies and aromatics. Wash and cut your veggies (mushrooms, onions, zucchini, and spinach) and have them ready for cooking. For the spinach, separate the leaves from the stems and chop up the stems and place with aromatics.  Cut up the aromatics (chili, garlic, and ginger). Bonus tip: Always use a compost bowl. \nCreate a plan. Think of what should be cooked during more time and what needs to be cooked with less time and cook based upon that order. Cook onions and mushrooms together in a pan. Wait a few minutes before throwing in your aromatics (aromatics will burn at a high temperature).  After 5 minutes of that cooking you will add in your zucchini.\nDo NOT overcook your veggies! Your veggies are better eaten raw so you should not cook them all the way through. Cook until they are crunchy. Add salt. \nLet your food chill. This will give your veggies a little crunch. Add spinach into the pan and allow it to cook a little and then add in your chopped up chicken. Add in your chicken juice for better taste!\nSeason your food. Add in the fermented soy sauce first. Then add very little sesame oil because the sesame oil is very strong and is flavor that you cannot take away. Lastly, add in your rice vinegar. Vinegar brings out the flavor in the foods.\nMake your dish look nice! Put it in a nice plate or bowl and you can garnish it with sesame seeds and scally wags. This will make your meal more enjoyable. Enjoy!!\nPractice and you will get better. Concentrate on what you\u2019re doing and get over your fears and practice will make you a better cook.",

Every single time I get in the kitchen to cook, there is always something I can learn or improve on and all it really takes to do that is paying attention! Cooking is about being intuitive and this series will break down all the tips, skills and techniques that i've picked up on my 8 year journey of being intuitive in the kitchen! \n#beginner #cookingtips #stirfry\n\nIf you've been a Brothers Green subscriber for years, I'm sure many of these tips are already in your arsenal. but like I said before, I'm constantly learning so there's always some new cooking love to spread around!\n\nRecipe: \n\nChicken and Veggie Stir-Fry\nMeat (chicken)\nSalt\nSeasoning\nCooking Oil\nMushrooms\nOnions\nZucchini\nSpinach\nChili\nGarlic\nGinger\nFermented Soy Sauce\nSesame Oil\nRice Vinegar\nSesame Seeds\nGarnish\n\nDry meat with a paper towel. A lot of chicken that come packaged come with extra liquid. This can be unfavorable when trying to fry up the chicken as the meat will not absorb the flavors if the meat is wet.\nEven out meat. Place the meat in a zip lock bag and pound it out until it is even.\nCoat with plenty of salt and seasoning. Many times foods will taste plain if it doesn\u2019t have enough seasoning. Also, allow the seasoned meat to sit for at least 10 minutes. Place the seasoned meat in fridge so it can dry out and the salt will help it dry out too. This will enhance the flavors of the seasoning. Give it another pat dry if a little bit of liquid is released while letting it sit.\nControl the heat of your pan. There are a different range of heat settings (low, medium, high). You control the heat based on how the foods are cooking.\nMake sure you have enough oil or fat in the pan so things cook properly and don\u2019t get burned. If you\u2019re worried about consuming too much fat from oils it is suggested to get healthy cooking oil. \nPreheat pan before you add oil. If you add oil before heating up pan then the oil will degrade. Add chicken to the pan and let it cook at a medium-low heat.  Let it cook for about 4 minutes until a white ring starts to form around the chicken. Flip it over and let it cook for a little less amount of time. In this case, for about 2-3 minutes on the other side. \nPull meat early and wrap it up in some tin foil as it will cook a little more in the tin foil.\nLet the meat sit and do NOT waste the juice from the cooked meat. Letting the meat sit for a few minutes will allow the meat to absorb the juice. Save the meat juice for later on to add to your dish.\nPrep your veggies and aromatics. Wash and cut your veggies (mushrooms, onions, zucchini, and spinach) and have them ready for cooking. For the spinach, separate the leaves from the stems and chop up the stems and place with aromatics.  Cut up the aromatics (chili, garlic, and ginger). Bonus tip: Always use a compost bowl. \nCreate a plan. Think of what should be cooked during more time and what needs to be cooked with less time and cook based upon that order. Cook onions and mushrooms together in a pan. Wait a few minutes before throwing in your aromatics (aromatics will burn at a high temperature).  After 5 minutes of that cooking you will add in your zucchini.\nDo NOT overcook your veggies! Your veggies are better eaten raw so you should not cook them all the way through. Cook until they are crunchy. Add salt. \nLet your food chill. This will give your veggies a little crunch. Add spinach into the pan and allow it to cook a little and then add in your chopped up chicken. Add in your chicken juice for better taste!\nSeason your food. Add in the fermented soy sauce first. Then add very little sesame oil because the sesame oil is very strong and is flavor that you cannot take away. Lastly, add in your rice vinegar. Vinegar brings out the flavor in the foods.\nMake your dish look nice! Put it in a nice plate or bowl and you can garnish it with sesame seeds and scally wags. This will make your meal more enjoyable. Enjoy!!\nPractice and you will get better. Concentrate on what you\u2019re doing and get over your fears and practice will make you a better cook."

In this video we are going to show you some awesome tricks to make delicious homemade pizza that won't cost you and your guests more than a buck or two. Top that off with an herbaceous pizza-inspired drink using the best quality - yet affordable - vodka from Smirnoff and you've got one heck of a glorious time. #smirnoffpartner\n\nWanna learn how to bake fresh, delicious, artisanal style sourdough bread at home?

In a bowl, add 2 \u00bd cups of water and add 1 \u00bd packets of instant yeast. Add a little olive oil.\n\n2. Add in your flour and start mixing and add salt. Keep adding flour little by little while kneading\n\nuntil the dough is supple.\n\n3. Place the dough in a bowl with some olive oil, cover it and store it somewhere warm for about\n\nan hour so it can rise.\n\n4. In a pan, add some olive oil, garlic, half an onion and add tomato sauce. Cook it and let it simmer\n\nfor about 2 hours. After turning off the heat, add some fresh basil leaves.\n\n5. In some tin foil, put a little bit of olive oil and add a couple of garlic cloves. Wrap the tin foil up\n\ninto a ball and place it in the oven for about 40 minutes at 400 degrees.\n\n6. Put your broccoli in an oven tray and add olive oil with some salt and mix it around.\n\n7. Roast in the oven for 10 minutes.\n\n8. Once the dough has risen, flatten it out with a roller and put it in an oven tray with a little bit of\n\nsprinkled flour at the bottom of the dough so that the dough doesn\u2019t stick to the tray.\n\n9. Add in your tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Throw in some raw pork meat, onions,\n\nspinach, olive oil and salt.\n\n10. Put it in the oven at maximum temperature and let it bake for 10 minutes on the rack level\n\nclosest to where the heat is coming from directly.\n\n11. For Vegan Pizza, put dough in the oven tray with a little bit of flour sprinkled underneath the\n\nflattened out dough. Take the roasted garlic and rub it on the dough. Add mozzarella cheese,\n\nbroccoli, corn, olive oil, salt &amp; pepper. Throw it in the oven at maximum temperature for 10\n\nminutes. Enjoy!\n\nCocktail:\n\n1. In a cup, add in some chopped lemons and sugar.\n\n2. Mash up the lemons in the cup.\n\n3. Add a shot of Vodka\n\n4. Add ice, water and a couple of basil of leaves.\n\nwould you like any of the supplies we used to film this video? check out kit for the complete guide! \nhttps://kit.com/BrothersGreen",

(No matter how busy your schedule is)  Click the link below and download my FREE bread baking checklists: http://bit.ly/bread-checklist\n\nDon't be overwhelmed if your first attempt does not come out nice like this one, I still screw up all the time! Sourdough bread baking is one of the trickiest crafts in the kitchen to master, and thats why I love it so much! #sourdough #breadmaking #homebaking #bread\n\n-Recipe -\n\n300 grams - whole wheat flower \n300 grams - all purpose or bread flour \n512 grams - water \n63 grams - starter \n10 grams salt \n\nMilling flour - I\u2019m aware that most people don\u2019t have their own flour mill, so this step is optional, and if you don\u2019t find your self some decent whole wheat flour. If you do mill your own flour make sure you sift some of the bran out to create a high extraction flour and a product that is a little easier to work with\n\nSteps and timing - Adjust timing to your schedule! \n\n3:00pm - combine flour with water and let it sit for at least 1 hour. Ideally you wait 4-5 hours but its not necessary. This step is called Autolyse which hydrates the flour and also develops some sugars in the flour for a better end result \n\n3:00pm feed your starter equal parts (by weight) flour and water and let sit for 4-5 hours until active \n\n7-8:00pm - add the starter to the dough and start your stretch and folds every thirty minutes for the first 2 hours of the bulk rise. On the second or 3rd stretch and fold, add your seasoning of choice to the dough. \n\n10:00pm - stretch and folds are done, cover and let it bulk rise/ferment overnight. \n\n7:00am - dough has risen, give it one last stretch and fold and remove it on the work surface to bench rest for 20-30 minutes.\n\n7:30am - form loaf and place in some sort of proofing basket for 1-2 hours until it has risen (like in video). \n\n8:30am- Preheat heavy pan with lid on at 500 degrees for 1 hour \n\n9:30am - Flip loaf out on parchment paper, score the loaf and transfer to the pan. Put lid on and bake for 20 minutes\n\n9:50am - take lid of, turn over down to 450 and bake uncovered for 20 more minutes\n\nlet cool if possible (usually not\u2026)  and enjoy! \n\nFor all the tools used in this video, check out our fermentation kit below.\nhttps://kit.com/BrothersGreen\n\nFollow Brothers Green Eats\nInstagram: \nBrothers Green - https://www.instagram.com/brothersgreen\nJosh - https://www.instagram.com/youenjoylife/\nMike - https://www.instagram.com/lifebymikeg/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nJosh and Mike Greenfield make up Brothers Green Eats, a dynamic and brotherly duo that can teach anyone to cook creative and delicious food on a budget.

I've been away on honeymoon but it feels great to get this video out. I've been cooking eggs since I could hold a spatula, it was the first thing I ever learned how to make, we are talking 15 years in the process of cooking eggs, so needless to say I have learned a few things over the years o making eggs great. \n\nThis is part one of two, in this video you'll learn how to make: \n1. Sunny Side Up Egg\n2. Eggs over Easy\n3. Fried Egg\n4. French Style Omelette\n5. Buffet Style Omelette\n6. Fluffy Omelette\n7. Breakfast Sandwich Omelette\n\nSunny Side Up (Fried Egg)\nIn a non-stick pan add a small amount of oil & heat. \nCrack in your egg to the pan. \nGently pull off the white membrane on the top layer of the egg so it can cook through. \nPlace a cover over the pan and steam for a few seconds to fully cook the white. \nAdd salt and pepper to taste. Serve.\n\nOver Easy Eggs\nCrack open an egg on your lightly greased non- stick pan. \nLet the white cook almost all the way through. \nGently flip your egg upside down in the pan, making sure to not break the yolk.\nSalt and pepper to taste. Slide off the pan and onto a plate. Enjoy! \n\nFried Scramble\nCrack open an egg on your lightly greased non- stick pan over medium high heat. \nWith a spatula give it a little mix, but do not over mix. \nLet it sit. Once it begins to lightly crisp on the edges, flip over and finish cooking.\nSalt and pepper to taste. \n\n15- Second French Style Omelette\nIn a bowl whisk together 3 eggs. Season with pepper to taste. \nAdd a splash of water or milk. \nGrease your non- stick pan and heat. \nOnce your pan is hot, pour in your eggs and quickly begin to swirl your pan to get the eggs to cook evenly into a fluffy omelette form. \nRemove from heat and slide onto a plate. Add toppings over your choice. \n\nBuffet Omelette\nGrease your non-stick pan and sautee the toppings of your choice. \nAdd a little more oil to the pan and pour in your whisked egg. Pepper to taste. \nPlace cheese of your choice over your omelette and fold your omelette over. All done! Salt to taste. \n\nFluffy Omelette\nPour in your whisked eggs to your greased and pre heated pan. \nOnce you feel your egg is firm enough to flip over, do so.\nOnce it is cooked through, add the toppings of your choice and fold over. Fluffy goodness! \n\nBreakfast Sandwich Omelette\nPour in 2 whisked eggs into a greased pan and allow it to cook. \nOnce most of the egg is cooked through, start folding it over on all sides, shaping it to fit your sandwich bread. \nPlace cheese and bacon over egg. \nPlace your egg, bacon and cheese in your bread to form your sandwich and let it sit in the pan until the cheese is melted. Top w/ Ketchup and hot sauce of your choice! \n\nsubscribe and follow us on the social media goodness\nsnapchat: brothers green\ninstagram: brothers green\nfacebook: Brothers Green Eats\n\nBuy the pan in this video: \nhttp://amzn.to/2de6B6c",

I've been away on honeymoon but it feels great to get this video out. I've been cooking eggs since I could hold a spatula, it was the first thing I ever learned how to make, we are talking 15 years in the process of cooking eggs, so needless to say I have learned a few things over the years o making eggs great. \n\nThis is part one of two, in this video you'll learn how to make: \n1. Sunny Side Up Egg\n2. Eggs over Easy\n3. Fried Egg\n4. French Style Omelette\n5. Buffet Style Omelette\n6. Fluffy Omelette\n7. Breakfast Sandwich Omelette\n\nSunny Side Up (Fried Egg)\nIn a non-stick pan add a small amount of oil & heat. \nCrack in your egg to the pan. \nGently pull off the white membrane on the top layer of the egg so it can cook through. \nPlace a cover over the pan and steam for a few seconds to fully cook the white. \nAdd salt and pepper to taste. Serve.\n\nOver Easy Eggs\nCrack open an egg on your lightly greased non- stick pan. \nLet the white cook almost all the way through. \nGently flip your egg upside down in the pan, making sure to not break the yolk.\nSalt and pepper to taste. Slide off the pan and onto a plate. Enjoy! \n\nFried Scramble\nCrack open an egg on your lightly greased non- stick pan over medium high heat. \nWith a spatula give it a little mix, but do not over mix. \nLet it sit. Once it begins to lightly crisp on the edges, flip over and finish cooking.\nSalt and pepper to taste. \n\n15- Second French Style Omelette\nIn a bowl whisk together 3 eggs. Season with pepper to taste. \nAdd a splash of water or milk. \nGrease your non- stick pan and heat. \nOnce your pan is hot, pour in your eggs and quickly begin to swirl your pan to get the eggs to cook evenly into a fluffy omelette form. \nRemove from heat and slide onto a plate. Add toppings over your choice. \n\nBuffet Omelette\nGrease your non-stick pan and sautee the toppings of your choice. \nAdd a little more oil to the pan and pour in your whisked egg. Pepper to taste. \nPlace cheese of your choice over your omelette and fold your omelette over. All done! Salt to taste. \n\nFluffy Omelette\nPour in your whisked eggs to your greased and pre heated pan. \nOnce you feel your egg is firm enough to flip over, do so.\nOnce it is cooked through, add the toppings of your choice and fold over. Fluffy goodness! \n\nBreakfast Sandwich Omelette\nPour in 2 whisked eggs into a greased pan and allow it to cook. \nOnce most of the egg is cooked through, start folding it over on all sides, shaping it to fit your sandwich bread. \nPlace cheese and bacon over egg. \nPlace your egg, bacon and cheese in your bread to form your sandwich and let it sit in the pan until the cheese is melted. Top w/ Ketchup and hot sauce of your choice! \n\nsubscribe and follow us on the social media goodness\nsnapchat: brothers green\ninstagram: brothers green\nfacebook: Brothers Green Eats\n\nBuy the pan in this video: \nhttp://amzn.to/2de6B6c"

This is where it all began for the Brothers Green, mastering the Bacon Egg and Cheese then moving our way up the food chain. \n\n-Menu- \n01:14 - Breakfast Burrito \n03:28 - Banana Peanut Butter HOC Special\n05:22 - PB and J stuffed French Toast \n07:26 - Instant Blueberry Oatmeal \n09:19 - Poached Egg Sandwich with Spinach and Bacon \n\nBreakfast burrito\nINGREDIENTS: \nSalsa\nShredded cheese\nAvocado\nTortilla\nEggs\n\nTurn your grease tray upside down and prop the front of your George Foreman grill on it to prevent food from sliding off and saving all that extra flavor. \nGrease and heat your grill and crack an egg over it.\nAdd cheese over your egg. \nPlace a couple of tablespoons of salsa over the cheese. \nSlide your egg off the grill and onto your tortilla. \nTop w/ avocado. \nRoll your tortilla up into a burrito, place on your grill and close. Remove when tortilla develops those nice and crispy grill marks and enjoy! \n\nBanana Peanut Butter HOC Special\nINGREDIENTS:\nPeanut butter\nRaisins\nBananas\nHoney\nCinnamon swirl bread\n\nToast your cinnamon swirl bread in your toaster oven, \nSpread peanut butter over your bread. \nFinely slice your banana and layer over your toast.\nDrizzle with honey. \nSprinkle with raisins. Grub time! Hangover be gone!!! \n\n\nPeanut Butter and Jelly stuffed French Toast\nINGREDIENTS: \nChallah bread\nPeanut butter\nJelly\nEggs\nHoney\n\nSlice a big chunk of challah. \nMake a slit in the middle of your bread, making sure not to slice all the way to the ends.\nStuff the slit with peanut butter and jelly. Wipe off excess. \nIn a bowl crack open an egg and whisk. \nGrease and heat your George Foreman grill. \nDip your bread into the egg, making sure that it is well coated. Transfer to your heated grill and close. \nTo make sure it is evenly being toasted flip your French toast in the grill until both sides are evenly toasted. \nDrizzle with honey! Amazing, simple AND delicious! \n\nBlueberry Oatmeal\nINGREDIENTS: \nOats\nAlmond milk\nPecans\nBlueberries\nHoney\n\nIn a hot pot toss in 1 cup of oats w/ 1.5 cup almond milk. Mix and adjust accordingly until it reaches your desired consistency. \nStir in \u00bd cup of blueberries, mashing the berries while you stir. \nPlace oatmeal in a small bowl and sprinkle with chopped pecans. \nDrizzle with honey and serve \u263a \n\n\nPoached Egg Sandwich\nINGREDIENTS:\nEnglish muffins\nEgg\nBacon\nSpinach\nSriracha\n\nFill your hot pot with water until it begins to boil and turn heat down to low. \nPlace eggs in the hot pot and cook for about an hour for a poached egg. If you are in a hurry just boil in hot pot for 7 minutes. Discard water from hot pot. Place in ice water immediately to stop it from cooking. \nLay down 3 strips of bacon on a paper towel and microwave for about 5 minutes. \nAdd a splash of oil to your hot pot. Add in your spinach and wilt. Remove spinach. \nButter the ring in the middle of your hot pot, place your English muffin on the ring and allow it to toast.

I would suggest using a heat pad under the the container to get this temperature because the end results  will be optimal! \n-Let it ferment for 7-10 days. Liquid should be a light golden brown color after it ferments \n-You can now enjoy a glass of your kombucha but a second fermentation is recommended for a better   flavor.

This time I'm showing you how to rock ingredients from a great market in Chinatown. Instead of breaking it down into days, this time I am breaking it down into parts so each video is it's own experience and you can learn all kinds of glorious tricks without taking in too much.\n\nIn this first video I am going over what I bought, Making Homemade Kimchee, and a delicious stir fry with a fried egg you would climb a mountain to try.\n\nKimchi\nINGREDIENTS:\nCabbage\n2 tbsp chopped Scallions\n2 Garlic cloves- chopped\nSalt\nChili powder\nSugar\n\nIn a large bowl add your cabbage, scallions and garlic. \nAdd a heavy amount of salt and mix all together. Allow it to sit to draw out the moisture for about 1 hour. \nRinse your cabbage and add back in a bowl. Add salt and chili powder to taste, along with 1 teaspoon on sugar and mix. \nPlace in a mason jar or sealable bowl and let it sit for 24 hours. \n\nVeggie Stir Fry\nINGREDIENTS:\n\u00bd tsp chopped ginger\n1 minced garlic clove\n1 chopped carrot\n1 cup of broccoli florets\n\u00bd a cup of bean sprouts\n2 tbsp chopped scallions\n\u00bc tsp chili\nSoy sauce\nSugar\nFried Egg\n\nIn a heated and oiled pan add in your ginger, garlic and carrots.

We busted our asses to nail these clone recipes and boy oh boy did we. The flavors are insane, the recipes are easy, and the taste is much fresher than the original. What's not to love? \n\nWhat was easily my favorite late night drive through, Wendy's always just did it fresher than the other fast food spots. It was cheap, it was delicious, and they had great options, on top of the fact that they invented a delicious dessert that wasn't quite a milkshake, and yet it wasn't quite ice cream either. \n\nIn part one we are whipping up some perfect clone sauces; honey mustard, ranch and bbq sauce as well as making their spicy chicken go wrap, the value chicken sandwich and their beloved nuggets which I can safely say are the best clone recipe out there. \n\nIntro Music Written by Josh of Brothers Green \n\nBackground Music Provided by Sebastian Bang Monti\nhttps://m.soundcloud.com/gnabishere\n\n\nwww.brothersgreen.com\ntwitter: brothersgreenbk\ninstagram: brothersgreen\nsnap chat: brothers green\nfacebook: Brothers Green Eats",

We busted our asses to nail these clone recipes and boy oh boy did we. The flavors are insane, the recipes are easy, and the taste is much fresher than the original. What's not to love? \n\nWhat was easily my favorite late night drive through, Wendy's always just did it fresher than the other fast food spots. It was cheap, it was delicious, and they had great options, on top of the fact that they invented a delicious dessert that wasn't quite a milkshake, and yet it wasn't quite ice cream either. \n\nIn part one we are whipping up some perfect clone sauces; honey mustard, ranch and bbq sauce as well as making their spicy chicken go wrap, the value chicken sandwich and their beloved nuggets which I can safely say are the best clone recipe out there. \n\nIntro Music Written by Josh of Brothers Green \n\nBackground Music Provided by Sebastian Bang Monti\nhttps://m.soundcloud.com/gnabishere\n\n\nwww.brothersgreen.com\ntwitter: brothersgreenbk\ninstagram: brothersgreen\nsnap chat: brothers green\nfacebook: Brothers Green Eats"

Some times I would just munch on leftovers and dig into some slaw, no sense in showing that but trust me I ate more than enough food every single day. \n\nfollow us!\nfacebook: brothers green\ninstagram and snapchat: brothersgreen\ntwitter: brothersgreenbk",

Some times I would just munch on leftovers and dig into some slaw, no sense in showing that but trust me I ate more than enough food every single day. \n\nfollow us!\nfacebook: brothers green\ninstagram and snapchat: brothersgreen\ntwitter: brothersgreenbk"

Blend in blender or food processor and spread on whatever, drink it, whatever you want.\n\nRoasted garlic:\nCut top off garlic bulb, place the bulb on a sheet of tinfoil, and zip with oil. Add a little salt and pepper. Bake at 350\u00ba for an hour. Spread on anything. \n\nGarlic chips:\nThinly slice peeled garlic and fry in oil over medium heat. Once chips turn brown, remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. These beautiful little chips are great for salads or soups."

We came up with ten wild recipes, new ways to cook your old favorites, and thing's that you have certainly never seen before. Time to get weird in the kitchen with the brothers green .\n\n10 Creative Egg Recipes\n\nEgg White Omelette with Plus Yolk Treat\n\n- Separate egg yolks. In an oiled pan fry egg whites, once set add yolks on top, fold and enjoy!\n\nEgg Noodles\n\n-Scramble eggs. In an oiled pan over medium-low heat coat bottom with scrambled eggs. Cover to steam. Once set, roll up egg and cut into noodles. Toss in  some tomato sauce for a glorious shakshuka style breakfast pasta!  \n\nJamie Oliver Inspired Egg Omelette\n\n- Whisk eggs until fluffy, frothy, and light. Heat oil on a nonstick pan and pour eggs. Once the bottom sets fold over. The top may look uncooked but since it's so airy and light it will cook fast. Garnish with some green onions.\n\nDeep Fried Poached Eggs\n\n- In a deep pot heat oil. Once it's hot crack an egg into the oil, be careful it will splash! Cook for about 30 seconds. Remove and enjoy!\n\nEgg on Egg Sandwich\n\n- Separate the yolk from 2 eggs. Beat egg whites with a whisk until still peaks form. On a parchment lined cookie sheet scoop egg whites into a bun shape. Bake at 350 until golden. In a pan fry an egg and add remaining 2 yolks. Season with salt and pepper. Put fried egg between baked egg white buns. Enjoy!\n\nSteamed Eggs \n\n(Ok..ok so messed it up in the video but this recipe works and it's silky and glorious!!)\n\n- In a bowl beat 3 eggs. Add 1 cup of water, and 2 teaspoons of salt, and beat again. Pour into a ramekin, or heat safe bowl. In a pot enough water to come up halfway on ramekin. Bring to a boil. Once boiled lower heat, and add ramekins. Cover and let steam for 8-12 minutes. Remove, it will be hot! Garnish with green onion. For even more flavor you could use vegetable or chicken broth in place of water and add a splash of sesame oil! Mmm...\n\nMarbled Egg\n\n- In a hot pan with oil crack egg and break yolk. Swirl to create a marbled look. Let it still, bottom will crisp up. Once top sets it's done. Add some Sriracha for a yummy kick!\n\nCrissomelette\n\n- Beat 6 eggs. Butter a hot pan, pour some egg mixture, let it set, and fold in half. On empty side of pan butter again, pour more egg, let it set, and fold onto other side. Repeat until egg mix is gone. Buttery layers of egg!\n\nDouble Broiler Scrambled Eggs\n\n- Heat water in a pan. Place a bowl on top with a pat of butter. Scramble 2 eggs. Once butter is melted add eggs and slowly mix and fold. After about 10 minutes you will have the most tender, delicate eggerts!

I don't remember the names of everything but the looks are what count. \n\nNo Frills Salsa - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nTango De Manzana - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nCunbia No Frills -  Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nChee Zee Beach - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nCarnivale Intrigue - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",

                "channelId": "UCzH5n3Ih5kgQoiDAQt2FwLw",
                "description": "-click for menu- \n\nThings are getting extra crazy in the BG kitchen as we rock the pork belly so hard you won't even know what to do with yourself. Josh figured out a great way, without using liquid smoke, or a smoker, to get a succulent mouthgasmic smokey pork belly and he has fun with the possibilities of Okonomiyaki while Mike stands by wishing he was the cooler brother. Also, the best soft boiled egg you'll ever eat.\n\nOkonomiyaki Ramen \n\nJapanese food and barbecue are two things that should go together more often! So we\u2019ve concocted an open-faced \u2018smoked\u2019 pork sandwich on a ramen pancake. You don\u2019t need a smoker to make it\u2014we\u2019ve got a funky trick for simulating the flavor of smoked meat.\n\nPork Belly:\nPork belly, skin off (get from your local butcher, you\u2019ll need a size around 7\u201d x14\u201d)\n1 white onion, sliced thin and burnt to a crisp (put slices on sheet tray, 350 until black)\n3 tablespoons smoked salt\n2 tablespoons smoked paprika\n1 tablespoon ground pepper\nOil\n1 cup sake\n\u00bd cup soy sauce\n1 cup water\n\u00bd cup sugar\n\u00bd cup bonito flakes\n3\u201d piece fresh ginger, sliced\n6 garlic cloves\n6 scallions (green onions)\n\nOkonomiyaki:\n1 egg\n\u00bc cup dashi broth (water that has had kombu, or seaweed sheets, and bonito flakes boiled in it) or water\n\u00bd cup all-purpose flour\nPinch salt\n2 scallions, chopped\n\u00bd green cabbage, thinly sliced\n4 pieces bacon, cooked and chopped\nGood-quality ramen noodles, cooked, drained and cooled\n\nOkonomiyaki Sauce:\n\u00bd cup ketchup\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce\n1 tablespoon honey\n\u00bc tsp. ground ginger\n\nPickled Eggs:\n2 eggs\n\u00bd cup soy sauce\n\u00bd cup rice vinegar\n2 tablespoons sugar\n\u00bc cup water\n\nGarnish:\n1 carrot, thinly shaved\nMayonnaise\n1 scallion, chopped\n\nDirections:\n\nPork Belly:\nPreheat oven to 275\u00b0.\n\nPrick belly with a fork several times. Rub both sides with the charred onions, smoked salt, smoked paprika and pepper. Zip it with a little oil. Roll up very tightly and tie with cooking twine. \n\nAdd soy, sake, water, sugar, bonito flakes, ginger, garlic and scallions to large, oven-safe saut\u00e9 pan. Cook on stove just until boiling; turn off heat.\n\nAdd belly to the oven-safe saut\u00e9 pan and loosely cover in tinfoil. Bake for 3-4 hours, turning pork every 30 minutes. Allow to cool, remove twine, and cut into \u00bd\u201d round slices.\n\nOkonomiyaki:\nIn a medium-sized bowl, mix egg, flour, salt, and dashi broth/water. Mix in scallions, cabbage and bacon. Add more dashi broth/water or flour if you need to loosen or thicken up the batter. Add drained ramen noodles.\n\nHeat a griddle or a large saut\u00e9 pan.

                    "description": "-click for menu- \n\nThings are getting extra crazy in the BG kitchen as we rock the pork belly so hard you won't even know what to do with yourself. Josh figured out a great way, without using liquid smoke, or a smoker, to get a succulent mouthgasmic smokey pork belly and he has fun with the possibilities of Okonomiyaki while Mike stands by wishing he was the cooler brother. Also, the best soft boiled egg you'll ever eat.\n\nOkonomiyaki Ramen \n\nJapanese food and barbecue are two things that should go together more often! So we\u2019ve concocted an open-faced \u2018smoked\u2019 pork sandwich on a ramen pancake. You don\u2019t need a smoker to make it\u2014we\u2019ve got a funky trick for simulating the flavor of smoked meat.\n\nPork Belly:\nPork belly, skin off (get from your local butcher, you\u2019ll need a size around 7\u201d x14\u201d)\n1 white onion, sliced thin and burnt to a crisp (put slices on sheet tray, 350 until black)\n3 tablespoons smoked salt\n2 tablespoons smoked paprika\n1 tablespoon ground pepper\nOil\n1 cup sake\n\u00bd cup soy sauce\n1 cup water\n\u00bd cup sugar\n\u00bd cup bonito flakes\n3\u201d piece fresh ginger, sliced\n6 garlic cloves\n6 scallions (green onions)\n\nOkonomiyaki:\n1 egg\n\u00bc cup dashi broth (water that has had kombu, or seaweed sheets, and bonito flakes boiled in it) or water\n\u00bd cup all-purpose flour\nPinch salt\n2 scallions, chopped\n\u00bd green cabbage, thinly sliced\n4 pieces bacon, cooked and chopped\nGood-quality ramen noodles, cooked, drained and cooled\n\nOkonomiyaki Sauce:\n\u00bd cup ketchup\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce\n1 tablespoon honey\n\u00bc tsp. ground ginger\n\nPickled Eggs:\n2 eggs\n\u00bd cup soy sauce\n\u00bd cup rice vinegar\n2 tablespoons sugar\n\u00bc cup water\n\nGarnish:\n1 carrot, thinly shaved\nMayonnaise\n1 scallion, chopped\n\nDirections:\n\nPork Belly:\nPreheat oven to 275\u00b0.\n\nPrick belly with a fork several times. Rub both sides with the charred onions, smoked salt, smoked paprika and pepper. Zip it with a little oil. Roll up very tightly and tie with cooking twine. \n\nAdd soy, sake, water, sugar, bonito flakes, ginger, garlic and scallions to large, oven-safe saut\u00e9 pan. Cook on stove just until boiling; turn off heat.\n\nAdd belly to the oven-safe saut\u00e9 pan and loosely cover in tinfoil. Bake for 3-4 hours, turning pork every 30 minutes. Allow to cool, remove twine, and cut into \u00bd\u201d round slices.\n\nOkonomiyaki:\nIn a medium-sized bowl, mix egg, flour, salt, and dashi broth/water. Mix in scallions, cabbage and bacon. Add more dashi broth/water or flour if you need to loosen or thicken up the batter. Add drained ramen noodles.\n\nHeat a griddle or a large saut\u00e9 pan. Zip with oil and spoon out enough of the batter to make a pancake slightly larger than the slices of pork belly. Cook on both sides until brown and crispy. Transfer to a paper towel.\n\nOkonomiyaki Sauce:\nMix all ingredients; transfer to empty zip bottle if you want.\n\nPickled Eggs:\nCook eggs in simmering water in medium saucepot for exactly 6 minutes. Drain eggs, run under cold water, and gently peel. Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and water in small bowl. Add peeled eggs and let sit, completely submerged, for at least an hour.\n\nAssembly:\nTake the okonomiyaki patty, top with a slice of the pork belly, and zip with mayo and okonomiyaki sauce. Pile some carrot slices on top. Cut a pickled egg in half and gently place atop the carrots. Sprinkle the whole thing with scallion and dive in!"

Make sure you only fill the jar with chickpeas about halfway\u2014they expand! Drain chickpeas and dry completely.\n\nIn the bowl of a large food processor, add the dry, swollen chickpeas, garlic, onion, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper.\n\nPulse until combined and mixture resembles a small, coarse crumb. While the food processor is running, add the olive oil.\n\nGet a 3\" ring mold, or whatever you have around that will form little sliders, and pack the bottom with the chickpea mixture. Stuff with the feta cheese. Top with more of the chickpea mixture and press firmly. Gently remove the ring mold and voila! A feta-stuffed falafel slider patty ready to fry!\n\nHeat \u00bd\" of oil in medium saut\u00e9 pan.\n\nGently transfer falafel patties to the hot oil and fry on both sides until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and hit with a small pinch of salt.\n\nCut out rounds of flatbread with the same size ring mold (or invert a mug on the flatbread and trace around the rim with a knife). Pan-fry until golden and toasty. Set aside.\n\nPickled Radish:\nAdd sugar, water and white vinegar to a microwave-safe dish and nuke until sugar is melted, about a minute. Add the thinly sliced radishes and pop in the fridge until cooled. (The mix can totally last in the fridge for a couple of weeks.)\n\nBaba Ganoush:\nPrick eggplant with fork several times. Cover in two layers of aluminum foil and cook over an open flame on medium heat until soft and mushy, about 45 minutes to an hour. If you don\u2019t have a gas burner, just toss it in your oven at 375\u00ba until soft.\n\nCarefully remove mushy cooked eggplant from foil, scrape the flesh out of the skin with a spoon, and add to the bowl of a food processor. \n\nAdd peanut butter, sesame oil, sambal, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and puree. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool.\n\nTomato Cucumber Salsa:\nChop all ingredients and transfer to a small bowl.\n\nWhite Sauce:\nCombine all in a zip bottle and shake until combined. (This sauce is amazing, you can use it on just about anything.)\n\nAssembly:\nDrain radishes on a paper towel.\n\nSpoon baba ganoush on half of the pita rounds. Top with radish, then crispy falafel, salsa, and another pita round. \n\nZip with white sauce and stuff your face!",

Make sure you only fill the jar with chickpeas about halfway\u2014they expand! Drain chickpeas and dry completely.\n\nIn the bowl of a large food processor, add the dry, swollen chickpeas, garlic, onion, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper.\n\nPulse until combined and mixture resembles a small, coarse crumb. While the food processor is running, add the olive oil.\n\nGet a 3\" ring mold, or whatever you have around that will form little sliders, and pack the bottom with the chickpea mixture. Stuff with the feta cheese. Top with more of the chickpea mixture and press firmly. Gently remove the ring mold and voila! A feta-stuffed falafel slider patty ready to fry!\n\nHeat \u00bd\" of oil in medium saut\u00e9 pan.\n\nGently transfer falafel patties to the hot oil and fry on both sides until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and hit with a small pinch of salt.\n\nCut out rounds of flatbread with the same size ring mold (or invert a mug on the flatbread and trace around the rim with a knife). Pan-fry until golden and toasty. Set aside.\n\nPickled Radish:\nAdd sugar, water and white vinegar to a microwave-safe dish and nuke until sugar is melted, about a minute. Add the thinly sliced radishes and pop in the fridge until cooled. (The mix can totally last in the fridge for a couple of weeks.)\n\nBaba Ganoush:\nPrick eggplant with fork several times. Cover in two layers of aluminum foil and cook over an open flame on medium heat until soft and mushy, about 45 minutes to an hour. If you don\u2019t have a gas burner, just toss it in your oven at 375\u00ba until soft.\n\nCarefully remove mushy cooked eggplant from foil, scrape the flesh out of the skin with a spoon, and add to the bowl of a food processor. \n\nAdd peanut butter, sesame oil, sambal, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and puree. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool.\n\nTomato Cucumber Salsa:\nChop all ingredients and transfer to a small bowl.\n\nWhite Sauce:\nCombine all in a zip bottle and shake until combined. (This sauce is amazing, you can use it on just about anything.)\n\nAssembly:\nDrain radishes on a paper towel.\n\nSpoon baba ganoush on half of the pita rounds. Top with radish, then crispy falafel, salsa, and another pita round. \n\nZip with white sauce and stuff your face!"

It's a savory cake with a nice slip of sweetness in it. This cake has a cornbread base with hot dogs in it, chili in the middle and covered in a mashed potato frosting and candied bacon, you'll just have to give it a try yourself, it's like nothing you have ever eaten before.\n\ncheck out http://brothersgreen.com/ for all recipes and social media links! \n\n-Recipe-\n\nCandied Bacon:\n\u00bd cup dark brown sugar\n2 Tbsp maple syrup\n\u00bc tsp cayenne powder\n2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar\nPinch salt & pepper\n1 pound thick-cut bacon strips\n\n\u201cFrosting\u201d/Filling:\n8 russet potatoes\n\u00bd stick unsalted butter, melted\n\u00be cup heavy cream, milk, or half-and-half, heated\n\u00bd Tbsp salt\nChili\n\nCake:\nCooking spray or oil \n2 boxes cornbread mix\n\u00bd cup masa harina (corn flour)\n3 eggs\n\u2154 cup buttermilk\n1 stick (8 Tbsp.) unsalted butter, melted\n1 (8 oz.) can creamed corn\n1 (4 oz.) can chopped green chilies\nCooked bacon, chopped\n6 hot dogs\n1 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n\nBBQ Sauce:\n\nThese measurements are just an approximation. Just feel it out and add a little more or a little less of anything you like or don\u2019t like. Have fun and experiment with the amounts!\n\n1 cup ketchup\n\u00bc cup apple cider vinegar\n2 Tbsp grainy mustard\n\u00bc cup packed brown sugar\n2 Tbsp molasses\n2 tsp chili powder\n1 tsp paprika\n\u00bd tsp cayenne powder\n\u00bd tsp garlic powder\n\u00bd tsp onion powder\n\nDirections:\n\nCandied Bacon:\nPreheat oven to 350\u00ba. You have to par-cook the bacon for a bit so the sugars won\u2019t burn. \n\nPlace bacon slices on a cooling rack over a parchment-lined baking sheet. The parchment paper really helps with cleanup! Bake the bacon for 10 minutes, flip the slices over, and bake for another 5.\n\nIn a small bowl combine the brown sugar, vinegar, maple, cayenne and salt and pepper. Mix it up with a pastry brush or clean paintbrush. \n\nBrush the par-cooked bacon with this mixture and bake another 5 minutes. Keep brushing the bacon every 5 minutes for a total of 40 minutes. Set a timer on your phone to help you out. This isn\u2019t as annoying as it sounds and it\u2019s totally worth it! Once your bacon is browned and crispy, you\u2019re good to go.\n\n\nMashed Potato Frosting:\nSteam the cleaned potatoes: Fill the bottom of a large pot with water. Once water is simmering, add potatoes to a steamer basket and cover with tight fitting lid or aluminum foil. Steam until the potatoes are super-soft and fork-tender--this can take anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes, it just depends on the size of the potatoes.\n\nOnce the potatoes cool down a bit, peel them. You can do this easily by rubbing a clean kitchen towel on the skin.\n\nTransfer steamed potatoes to a large bowl and start to mash them up with a potato masher, wooden spoon, fork, or whatever you have around the kitchen. Once they\u2019re mashed, add melted butter, warm milk or cream, and salt. Mix it all up and get it as smooth as possible. Set aside.\n\nCornbread Cake:\nPreheat oven to 375\u00ba. Spray two 9-inch cake pans with pan spray or lightly coat the insides with vegetable oil.\n\nIn a medium bowl, combine cornbread mix, masa harina, eggs, buttermilk, melted butter, creamed corn, green chilies, and chopped bacon and mix just until combined. Add more buttermilk or masa if needed.\n\nTransfer batter to the cake pans. Add three hot dogs to each pan in a triangle shape in the middle. Bake 25 minutes or until done. \n\nTop both cakes with the cheddar cheese and put back in the oven for 1 minute to melt the cheese.\n\nBBQ sauce:\nAdd all ingredients to a small saucepot and heat until it simmers. Remove from heat and let cool.\n\nAssembly:\nTake one cooled cornbread cake and put on a big plate. Top with chili and mashed potatoes. \n\nPlace other cooled cornbread cake on top. \n\nCover the whole cake in mashed potatoes. \n\nCover the mashed potatoes with the cooled, crispy, delicious candied bacon. If you want to get fancy, you can top the whole cake with a scoop of mashed potatoes and shredded cheddar cheese. Zip entire cake with the BBQ sauce and dive in!\n\nAnd if you even want to take it a step further: Cut a slice of cake, heat a small pan, zip with oil, and fry/grill the cake slice. Zip again with BBQ sauce and party!",

You can do this easily by rubbing a clean kitchen towel on the skin.\n\nTransfer steamed potatoes to a large bowl and start to mash them up with a potato masher, wooden spoon, fork, or whatever you have around the kitchen. Once they\u2019re mashed, add melted butter, warm milk or cream, and salt. Mix it all up and get it as smooth as possible. Set aside.\n\nCornbread Cake:\nPreheat oven to 375\u00ba. Spray two 9-inch cake pans with pan spray or lightly coat the insides with vegetable oil.\n\nIn a medium bowl, combine cornbread mix, masa harina, eggs, buttermilk, melted butter, creamed corn, green chilies, and chopped bacon and mix just until combined. Add more buttermilk or masa if needed.\n\nTransfer batter to the cake pans. Add three hot dogs to each pan in a triangle shape in the middle. Bake 25 minutes or until done. \n\nTop both cakes with the cheddar cheese and put back in the oven for 1 minute to melt the cheese.\n\nBBQ sauce:\nAdd all ingredients to a small saucepot and heat until it simmers. Remove from heat and let cool.\n\nAssembly:\nTake one cooled cornbread cake and put on a big plate. Top with chili and mashed potatoes. \n\nPlace other cooled cornbread cake on top. \n\nCover the whole cake in mashed potatoes. \n\nCover the mashed potatoes with the cooled, crispy, delicious candied bacon. If you want to get fancy, you can top the whole cake with a scoop of mashed potatoes and shredded cheddar cheese. Zip entire cake with the BBQ sauce and dive in!\n\nAnd if you even want to take it a step further: Cut a slice of cake, heat a small pan, zip with oil, and fry/grill the cake slice. Zip again with BBQ sauce and party!"

Enough to cook the noodles and to have a broth, after all this is noodle soup! While you wait for the water to boil start thinly slicing your vegetables. You can use any vegetables really, but I used sweet red pepper, and mushrooms (thinly slicing your vegetables ensures that you vegetables will cook quickly). Once you water comes to a boil add your noodles! I used dried ramen noodles, you can use something else if you want. As your noodles start to cook add the miso paste, vinegar, Sriracha, soy sauce and a splash of sesame oil mix. Then add your whole egg (for a soft boil egg cook for 6 minutes, hardboiled around 10 minutes and take out and put in cool water). If you want the crispy noodles on top then remove some of the noodles and place on a paper towel to dry. Then in a pan add oil and noodles and crisp up! Add sliced vegetables into broth and let it cook down. To balance out the flavors I added a bit of honey. Let it cook down more. Plate and top with chopped scallion, crispy noodle (optional) and egg!\n\nRemember to taste you food throughout the cooking process!

For those of you who don't get mtv or live in the states, you can watch most of the recipes right here on our channel!!! \n\nMike once had a dream to combine donut and bagel to make the ULTIMATE BREAKFAST. So we made a jelly-filled everything-bagel-nut with sausage and egg scramble. Ladies and gentleman, THE BAGELNUT!\n\nEverything Spice Mix:\n\u00bc cup sesame seeds\n1 tablespoon minced onion\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\n1 tablespoon poppy seed\n1 teaspoon sea salt\n\nCream Cheese Frosting:\n\u00bd stick cream cheese, softened\n\u00bc cup powdered sugar\n1 tablespoons milk\n\nJelly Stuffed Donut:\n1 can jumbo buttermilk flake biscuit dough\n\u00bc cup jelly, whatever your favourite flavor is\nOil for frying\n\nSausage and Egg Scramble:\n1 breakfast sausage link\n2 eggs\nLarge pinch shredded cheddar cheese\n1 scallion, chopped\nDash of salt & pepper\n\nMaple Ketchup:\n\u00bc cup maple syrup\n\u00bc cup ketchup\n\nDirections:\n\nEverything Spice Mix:\nCombine all in a small mason jar and set aside.\n\nCream Cheese Frosting:\nCombine all in a bowl and mix until smooth. Add more powdered sugar or milk if needed\u2014you\u2019re looking for a nice, creamy, pourable frosting to dip your donuts in.\n\nJelly Stuffed Donut:\n\nPreheat your deep fryer or heat oil in a deep saut\u00e9 pan.You\u2019ll need two biscuits. Press out each one until thin. Make a ring of jelly on one of the biscuits. Top with the other biscuit and firmly press the seams to seal. Make a small hole in the center and seal again. You\u2019re making a jelly-filled ring donut, you get the point! Fry donut until golden, flipping halfway through. Drain on a wire rack. While the donut is still warm, dip it in the frosting and return to wire rack so the excess frosting will drip off. Sprinkle the warm frosting-dipped donut with the everything-bagel-spice mixture.\n\nEggs and Sausage:\nButterfly sausage and pan-fry until cooked through and seared.\nScramble eggs, scallions and cheddar with the dash of salt and pepper.\n\nMaple Ketchup:\nCombine both in a small bowl.\n\nAssembly:\nTop the donut with the butterflied sausage and scrambled eggs. Zip this beast with maple ketchup. Time to amaze your taste buds!",

For those of you who don't get mtv or live in the states, you can watch most of the recipes right here on our channel!!! \n\nMike once had a dream to combine donut and bagel to make the ULTIMATE BREAKFAST. So we made a jelly-filled everything-bagel-nut with sausage and egg scramble. Ladies and gentleman, THE BAGELNUT!\n\nEverything Spice Mix:\n\u00bc cup sesame seeds\n1 tablespoon minced onion\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\n1 tablespoon poppy seed\n1 teaspoon sea salt\n\nCream Cheese Frosting:\n\u00bd stick cream cheese, softened\n\u00bc cup powdered sugar\n1 tablespoons milk\n\nJelly Stuffed Donut:\n1 can jumbo buttermilk flake biscuit dough\n\u00bc cup jelly, whatever your favourite flavor is\nOil for frying\n\nSausage and Egg Scramble:\n1 breakfast sausage link\n2 eggs\nLarge pinch shredded cheddar cheese\n1 scallion, chopped\nDash of salt & pepper\n\nMaple Ketchup:\n\u00bc cup maple syrup\n\u00bc cup ketchup\n\nDirections:\n\nEverything Spice Mix:\nCombine all in a small mason jar and set aside.\n\nCream Cheese Frosting:\nCombine all in a bowl and mix until smooth. Add more powdered sugar or milk if needed\u2014you\u2019re looking for a nice, creamy, pourable frosting to dip your donuts in.\n\nJelly Stuffed Donut:\n\nPreheat your deep fryer or heat oil in a deep saut\u00e9 pan.You\u2019ll need two biscuits. Press out each one until thin. Make a ring of jelly on one of the biscuits. Top with the other biscuit and firmly press the seams to seal. Make a small hole in the center and seal again. You\u2019re making a jelly-filled ring donut, you get the point! Fry donut until golden, flipping halfway through. Drain on a wire rack. While the donut is still warm, dip it in the frosting and return to wire rack so the excess frosting will drip off. Sprinkle the warm frosting-dipped donut with the everything-bagel-spice mixture.\n\nEggs and Sausage:\nButterfly sausage and pan-fry until cooked through and seared.\nScramble eggs, scallions and cheddar with the dash of salt and pepper.\n\nMaple Ketchup:\nCombine both in a small bowl.\n\nAssembly:\nTop the donut with the butterflied sausage and scrambled eggs. Zip this beast with maple ketchup. Time to amaze your taste buds!"

Then take your saran wrap and place it over the chicken and lightly pound it (this will tenderize the meat). In a bowl crack one egg, pour in your hot sauce of choice and whisk together. In another bowl combine flour, cayenne pepper powder, garlic powder, cracked black pepper, and salt. Now it's time to bread your chicken. Coat the chicken in the four mixture first, then the egg mixture, and back to the dry mix. Shake off excess flour and put the breaded chicken in the freezer for better results. Heat oil on medium fire and fry the chicken for 3-4 minutes on each side, salt and drain on a paper towel. Now it's time to build your sandwich! Start with toasting your buns. Once toasted smear both buns with mayo, place your chicken on followed by lettuce, tomato, and your top bun. \n\nFreestyle Rap by Young Chez (Marc Geffen) \nhttp://www.depthdepartment.com/vividandvague\n\n\nfor all recipes go to http://www.brothersgreen.com \n\nYoutube - http://www.youtube.com/brothersgreeneats\n\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/brothersgreen\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats \n\nmusic provided by the Youtube Catalogue and royalty free music from http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/",

Then take your saran wrap and place it over the chicken and lightly pound it (this will tenderize the meat). In a bowl crack one egg, pour in your hot sauce of choice and whisk together. In another bowl combine flour, cayenne pepper powder, garlic powder, cracked black pepper, and salt. Now it's time to bread your chicken. Coat the chicken in the four mixture first, then the egg mixture, and back to the dry mix. Shake off excess flour and put the breaded chicken in the freezer for better results. Heat oil on medium fire and fry the chicken for 3-4 minutes on each side, salt and drain on a paper towel. Now it's time to build your sandwich! Start with toasting your buns. Once toasted smear both buns with mayo, place your chicken on followed by lettuce, tomato, and your top bun. \n\nFreestyle Rap by Young Chez (Marc Geffen) \nhttp://www.depthdepartment.com/vividandvague\n\n\nfor all recipes go to http://www.brothersgreen.com \n\nYoutube - http://www.youtube.com/brothersgreeneats\n\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/brothersgreen\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats \n\nmusic provided by the Youtube Catalogue and royalty free music from http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/"

Drain and squeeze liquid out. In a pan oil a mason jar lid on both sides. Press potato shreds into mason jar ring, fry, flip, and sprinkle with salt. Remove ring. In a bowl pour dried onions and add hot water to rehydrate. To make the sauce mix mayo, mustard, and ketchup (1:1:2).

This is the closest clone recipe that I could recreate, there is something about McDonald's that you just can't ever replicate perfectly but this taste and feels just like the McNugget. Give it a try, so glorious! \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n \u2022 Ground chicken\n \u2022 1 egg\n \u2022 Salt\n \u2022 Flour\n \u2022 Cornstarch\n \u2022 1 beaten egg\n \u2022 1-2 tbsp mustard\n\n \u2022 Mix your ground chicken, egg and salt until everything is well blended. \n \u2022 Shape your ground chicken into nugget shapes. \n \u2022 Mix equal parts flour and cornstarch and dredge your nuggets in the mixture. \n \u2022 Freeze the nuggets until solid. \n \u2022 Mix your beaten egg, mustard and 1 cup of your flour and cornstarch mixture and \u00bd a cup of water until it creates a thin batter. \n \u2022 Dip your frozen nuggets into the batter and fry in vegetable oil at 350 until cooked through and golden brown. You can either dig in or if you want extra crispy nuggets you can freeze the nuggets one more time and fry for a second time until extra crispy! GLORIOUS!! \n\n\nMaking homemade fast food freaking rocks! So much better than buying it out there, and you won't crap your pants.",

This is the closest clone recipe that I could recreate, there is something about McDonald's that you just can't ever replicate perfectly but this taste and feels just like the McNugget. Give it a try, so glorious! \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n \u2022 Ground chicken\n \u2022 1 egg\n \u2022 Salt\n \u2022 Flour\n \u2022 Cornstarch\n \u2022 1 beaten egg\n \u2022 1-2 tbsp mustard\n\n \u2022 Mix your ground chicken, egg and salt until everything is well blended. \n \u2022 Shape your ground chicken into nugget shapes. \n \u2022 Mix equal parts flour and cornstarch and dredge your nuggets in the mixture. \n \u2022 Freeze the nuggets until solid. \n \u2022 Mix your beaten egg, mustard and 1 cup of your flour and cornstarch mixture and \u00bd a cup of water until it creates a thin batter. \n \u2022 Dip your frozen nuggets into the batter and fry in vegetable oil at 350 until cooked through and golden brown. You can either dig in or if you want extra crispy nuggets you can freeze the nuggets one more time and fry for a second time until extra crispy! GLORIOUS!! \n\n\nMaking homemade fast food freaking rocks! So much better than buying it out there, and you won't crap your pants."

Sweat them out! You want a nice brown caramelization. Season with salt and pepper and add beef broth. Bring to a boil or simmer. Pour into a coffee mug and add pieces of bread. Stale bread works best because it's crispy and will absorb the broth while still holding it's shape and texture. Cover the mug with provolone cheese over lapping to cover all sides. Place in the broiler till cheese browns and bubbles.

A creative and simple way to make homemade cheese slices. Best part? You can make any sort of cheese slices with this method, whole milk, and even non dairy vegan cheeses using almond, coconut, or soy milk! You can even flavor the cheese! All you need is some milk, whatever flavoring you'd like and something called \"Agar Agar\". You can buy it at speciality grocery stores or order it online. It isn't expensive and a little goes a long way. Agar agar is made from seaweed and is natural, and tasteless. \n\nAside from cheese slices you can make cheese wheels and spice your cheese up by adding jalapenos, chipotles, hot sauce, or even mac and cheese powder!

Cut the chicken up into cubes about 1 inch wide and toss in the marinade. Cutting the chicken small will help it marinade quickly and cook even quicker so you can enjoy this meal with little prep and waiting! \n\nAllow chicken to marinade until all the other components are done. Once you are almost ready to assemble and rice is cooked, place a pan over medium high heat, add some oil, drain off the marinade from the chicken and place in pan. Cook for a few minutes, until nice and golden, on one side. Flip the chicken over and cook on the other side for a few more minutes until fully cooked. Take a taste, so good...\n\nFor The Taco Shell\nIngredients:\nMedium Sized Flour Tortillas\n\nPreheat oven to 350\u00ba F. Take a muffin tin, flip it over and press the tortilla in between the muffin tins to form a bowl with four points. Bake for 10-20 minutes or until golden brown and firm. Let it rest. \n\nGinger Guacamole\nIngredients: \n1 Avocado\n1 Tablespoon of Ginger finely minced\n1 Lime\nSalt and Pepper\n\nIn a small bowl add the juice of one lime and the minced ginger. Open up a ripe avocado and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. Add some salt and pepper and mix and mash with a fork or spoon. Taste, adjust seasoning and enjoy a deliciously surprising guacamole thanks to that ginger. Add more or less ginger to your liking. \n\nKoKos Cheeseland Cheesy Mushroom Rice\nIngredients:\n1 Thick Slice of  KoKos Cheese\n1-2 Tablespoon of Cilantro\n6-8 Baby Bella Mushrooms\n1 and 1/2 Cup of Basmati Rice\n1 Cup of Coconut Milk\nWater\nSalt and Pepper\n\nIn a saucepan add around 1 and 1/2 cup of Rice. Pour in 2 Cups of water and 1 cup of coconut milk. Add in sliced Baby Bella Mushrooms and some salt and pepper to taste. Squeeze in a splash of oil if you'd like. Bring the rice to a boil, stirring, then lower the heat to a simmer, cover, and let sit for 7-10 minutes or until rice is cooked. If you are unsure, just quickly open the top, take a small amount with a spoon, taste it and see what it taste like. While rice is cooking cut the KoKos cheese into small cubes and finely chop up cilantro. When rice is done cooking, remove from heat, stir in the cheese until it begins to melt slightly, stir in the cilantro and let it sit covered until other components are done. Be careful not to eat it all before you are finished cooking because it is addicting...\n\nTo Assemble Cheesy Taco Bowl\nTake a taco bowl and add the cheesy rice to the bottom. Then add a hefty amount of chicken on top, shred some extra cheese on top if you'd like, followed by a generous serving of the guacamole. Eat anyway you can, it wont last long because it is so dang delicious!\n\nFor more awesome, simple and cheap recipes, unpredictable Brothers Green shenanigans and culinary surprises subscribe by clicking the link above, like this video, and comment with questions, thoughts, and ideas. \n\nWebsite - http://brothersgreen.com/\n\nYoutube - http://www.youtube.com/brothersgreeneats\n\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/brothersgreen\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats",

Cut the chicken up into cubes about 1 inch wide and toss in the marinade. Cutting the chicken small will help it marinade quickly and cook even quicker so you can enjoy this meal with little prep and waiting! \n\nAllow chicken to marinade until all the other components are done. Once you are almost ready to assemble and rice is cooked, place a pan over medium high heat, add some oil, drain off the marinade from the chicken and place in pan. Cook for a few minutes, until nice and golden, on one side. Flip the chicken over and cook on the other side for a few more minutes until fully cooked. Take a taste, so good...\n\nFor The Taco Shell\nIngredients:\nMedium Sized Flour Tortillas\n\nPreheat oven to 350\u00ba F. Take a muffin tin, flip it over and press the tortilla in between the muffin tins to form a bowl with four points. Bake for 10-20 minutes or until golden brown and firm. Let it rest. \n\nGinger Guacamole\nIngredients: \n1 Avocado\n1 Tablespoon of Ginger finely minced\n1 Lime\nSalt and Pepper\n\nIn a small bowl add the juice of one lime and the minced ginger. Open up a ripe avocado and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. Add some salt and pepper and mix and mash with a fork or spoon. Taste, adjust seasoning and enjoy a deliciously surprising guacamole thanks to that ginger. Add more or less ginger to your liking. \n\nKoKos Cheeseland Cheesy Mushroom Rice\nIngredients:\n1 Thick Slice of  KoKos Cheese\n1-2 Tablespoon of Cilantro\n6-8 Baby Bella Mushrooms\n1 and 1/2 Cup of Basmati Rice\n1 Cup of Coconut Milk\nWater\nSalt and Pepper\n\nIn a saucepan add around 1 and 1/2 cup of Rice. Pour in 2 Cups of water and 1 cup of coconut milk. Add in sliced Baby Bella Mushrooms and some salt and pepper to taste. Squeeze in a splash of oil if you'd like. Bring the rice to a boil, stirring, then lower the heat to a simmer, cover, and let sit for 7-10 minutes or until rice is cooked. If you are unsure, just quickly open the top, take a small amount with a spoon, taste it and see what it taste like. While rice is cooking cut the KoKos cheese into small cubes and finely chop up cilantro. When rice is done cooking, remove from heat, stir in the cheese until it begins to melt slightly, stir in the cilantro and let it sit covered until other components are done. Be careful not to eat it all before you are finished cooking because it is addicting...\n\nTo Assemble Cheesy Taco Bowl\nTake a taco bowl and add the cheesy rice to the bottom. Then add a hefty amount of chicken on top, shred some extra cheese on top if you'd like, followed by a generous serving of the guacamole. Eat anyway you can, it wont last long because it is so dang delicious!\n\nFor more awesome, simple and cheap recipes, unpredictable Brothers Green shenanigans and culinary surprises subscribe by clicking the link above, like this video, and comment with questions, thoughts, and ideas. \n\nWebsite - http://brothersgreen.com/\n\nYoutube - http://www.youtube.com/brothersgreeneats\n\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/brothersgreen\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats"

Making pizza from scratch is not only delicious but it will blow your friends minds. You'll be hearing comments like \"holy shit? Damn, you really made this? From scratch? Man that is awesome!\" \n\nThe dough takes a little while to get used to but it is extremely versatile, you can make pizza, you can make flatbreads, white bread loafs, you can grill it, bake it or even fry it. All we ask is that you attempt to make it, remember that not everything always turns out perfect the first time, and keep trying until you get something delicious. \n\nPizza is a great date night food and a great way to feed a crowd on a tight budget. If you don't want to make the dough you can buy a dough ball for $3-4 at your local pizza shop or grocery store. Rock it!\n\nIngredients: \n1 Cup of Warm Water (Between 110 and 115 Degree F)\n1 Packed of Active Dry Yeast or 2 and 1/2 teaspoons\n3-4 Cups of Flour\n1-2 t of Salt \n1 t of Honey\n\n1. Mix the warm water, honey and the yeast together well and let that sit until it gets all nice and bubbly. Add in a splash of olive oil or other oil if you'd like. \n2. Take a large bowl and add 2 cups of flour and the salt. Stir in the warm water and mix and mix and mix. As the mixture begins to make love to itself keep adding flour until your water/flour turns in to somewhat of a dough creature. This dough creature will eventually want to stop being beaten with a spoon and come out. \n3. Sprinkle some flour on to an open space that you can cook on and add the dough creature. Mix him around and knead adding flour as you go until the dough creature begins to form in to a ball. \n4. At this point wash your hands and get off all of the dough creature crap. Continue kneading and keep on doing so, adding more flour, until the dough becomes smooth and does not stick to your hands. \n5. Let the dough rest in a bowl that is covered with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a towel and let sit until it rises 2 to 3 times the size. \n6. Boom, pizza dough.\n\nNote: The warm water needs to be around 110-115 Degrees to active the yeast otherwise the dough will not rise. Thing is most people don't have thermometers or a way to gauge the temperature so I always use the body temperature method. If the water feels a little warm when you touch it it is probably around the right temperature since body temp is around 98.5 anything warm to your touch should be okay. Thermometer is the best method but i've used this a million times and have had great dough.\n\nWebsite - http://brothersgreen.com/\n\nYoutube - http://www.youtube.com/brothersgreeneats\n\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/brothersgreen\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats",

Making pizza from scratch is not only delicious but it will blow your friends minds. You'll be hearing comments like \"holy shit? Damn, you really made this? From scratch? Man that is awesome!\" \n\nThe dough takes a little while to get used to but it is extremely versatile, you can make pizza, you can make flatbreads, white bread loafs, you can grill it, bake it or even fry it. All we ask is that you attempt to make it, remember that not everything always turns out perfect the first time, and keep trying until you get something delicious. \n\nPizza is a great date night food and a great way to feed a crowd on a tight budget. If you don't want to make the dough you can buy a dough ball for $3-4 at your local pizza shop or grocery store. Rock it!\n\nIngredients: \n1 Cup of Warm Water (Between 110 and 115 Degree F)\n1 Packed of Active Dry Yeast or 2 and 1/2 teaspoons\n3-4 Cups of Flour\n1-2 t of Salt \n1 t of Honey\n\n1. Mix the warm water, honey and the yeast together well and let that sit until it gets all nice and bubbly. Add in a splash of olive oil or other oil if you'd like. \n2. Take a large bowl and add 2 cups of flour and the salt. Stir in the warm water and mix and mix and mix. As the mixture begins to make love to itself keep adding flour until your water/flour turns in to somewhat of a dough creature. This dough creature will eventually want to stop being beaten with a spoon and come out. \n3. Sprinkle some flour on to an open space that you can cook on and add the dough creature. Mix him around and knead adding flour as you go until the dough creature begins to form in to a ball. \n4. At this point wash your hands and get off all of the dough creature crap. Continue kneading and keep on doing so, adding more flour, until the dough becomes smooth and does not stick to your hands. \n5. Let the dough rest in a bowl that is covered with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a towel and let sit until it rises 2 to 3 times the size. \n6. Boom, pizza dough.\n\nNote: The warm water needs to be around 110-115 Degrees to active the yeast otherwise the dough will not rise. Thing is most people don't have thermometers or a way to gauge the temperature so I always use the body temperature method. If the water feels a little warm when you touch it it is probably around the right temperature since body temp is around 98.5 anything warm to your touch should be okay. Thermometer is the best method but i've used this a million times and have had great dough.\n\nWebsite - http://brothersgreen.com/\n\nYoutube - http://www.youtube.com/brothersgreeneats\n\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/brothersgreen\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats"

You see the truth is that every piece of meat cooks differently, that every oven, every grill, every pan is unique unto itself and because of this we offer information that is far more valuable than a straight forward recipe. Sure you can look up a recipe, follow it and hope it applies to your exact situation but we want to help you figure it out for yourself. \n\nWhen it comes to cooking meat on a grill there are a few things that you should know: \n\n1. Meat grilled, no matter how overcooked is still going to be more delicious than meat overcooked in a pan or in the oven. The grill is magic and does special things that you can't do inside. \n\n2. All pieces of steak are different, some are really thick and need a long time to cook, while others are thin and cook quickly. If you apply direct heat, ala a flame as opposed to indirect heat or something like an oven, you run the risk off burning the outside of the steak before it cooks on the inside. Often cooks will sear something to get it crispy on both sides and then finish it in the oven so it cooks evenly and all the way through. This can be achieved by closing the lid of the grill and placing it away from the heat source. You can shut off one burner, place the steak in that area and keep the other burners on or you an put it on the grill shelf if you have one. \n\n3. Touch your meat. When cooking, if you don't have a thermometer the best way to know if meat is done is by feeling it. As the meat cooks it gets firmer and firmer and as you learn how to cook you will develop a feel for the meat. You will start to feel for the perfect medium rare or medium if that is what you like. All you have to do is press on the middle of the steak and see how it feels. \n\n4. Get the grill really hot, pat the steak dry, season the steak with salt, pepper and a little oil and sear it for a few minutes on one side. Don't move the steak, depending on the thickness for 3-5 minutes and after that time check the side and see how the char is. If it is nice and charred flip it over and cook on the other side. This is the part where you want to start feeling the steak. Everyone 1 minute or so just give it a little press and you will feel how it changes and gets firmer and firmer as it cooks. \n\n5. Pull it off and try a litte part of it. When cooking steak it is good to let the steak rest for 5-10 minutes to let the juices settle so that way when you cut in to it the flavor doesn't come falling out of the steak. But to be honest if you are learning for the first time don't be afraid to cut a piece of steak by the end just to see how it is doing. If you are cooking for friends and have 4 steaks on the grill, use one as the crash test dummy. Take him off a little early and just cut a little slice off and see how he looks. I can't tell you how many times that I have done this. Also if the steak isn't cooked enough yet just throw that bastard back on.\n\n6. Don't be afraid to fuck up. Like most of the great food I have made none of it came without making a whole shit ton of mistakes, screwing up again and again until I finally got something that was delicious. You have to start somewhere, start simple and a nice piece of meat will practically cook itself. The cheaper cuts of meat are harder to cook and if cooked right are just as delicious but expensive cuts are a synch and can be tender and flavorful no matter what the method.\n\nWebsite - http://brothersgreen.com/\n\nYoutube - http://www.youtube.com/brothersgreeneats\n\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/brothersgreen\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats",

If you cut it up in to fillets you can insert a little slit in the side and stuff it with whatever you'd like. In this case we crushed up some garlic and some fresh herbs and slipped them in to the side of the salmon. Then we put it on the grill and smoked it on a low flame to allow it to get the delicious smoked flavor that so many love when grilling. \n\nWhile that was happening we took some green beans and did a neat little steam trick. You take some aluminum foil and wrap it up in to a pouch. Add in the green beans, some salt, pepper, oil, garlic, and a little butter if you'd like, close the pouch up and toss it on the grill to steam it up. Man is that delicious. \n\nWhile everything is on the grill cooking, and as the drinks flow, we took some fresh tomatoes, garlic, cucumbers, lime juice, red wine vinegar, salt and pepper and we made a nice fresh salsa/relish to go on top. The day kept getting weirder and weirder as the music jammed on and as the bowls went round but man did it turn out to be damn delicious.\n\nWebsite - http://brothersgreen.com/\n\nYoutube - http://www.youtube.com/brothersgreeneats\n\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/brothersgreen\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BrothersGreenBK\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BrothersGreenEats",
