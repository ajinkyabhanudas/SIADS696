It's a take on the classic deep-fried zucchini, but much healthier, and (almost) as addictive. We all know nothing's truly as good as deep fried. But who wants to fry at home? This version is really, really good, and so much easier -- trust me. Coat sticks of zucchini with light breadcrumbs (panko) and savory Parmesan cheese, quickly bake them to crunchy perfection, and watch them disappear! \n\nRecipe: http://www.marthastewart.com/355867/zucchini-fries\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\nMore Vegetarian Recipes: http://full.sc/P0o7Mt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?

                "description": "If you think you don't like fruitcake, you might want to reconsider -- that is, after trying out this couldn't-be-easier (and couldn't-be-tastier) recipe for cranberry-orange loaves. Baked in mini loaf pans, these adorable treats would make lovely holiday gifts for anyone on your list (they can be stored in an airtight container for three days or frozen, unglazed, for three weeks). Of course, the hardest part about gifting this delicious quick bread is getting it out of your own kitchen. Spread some seasonal joy with these cheerful sweets.\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nIf you're really feeling generous, make larger versions of these mini quick breads. Divide the batter between two 4 1/2-by-8 1/2-inch loaf pans and bake for 50 to 60 minutes.\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREP: 30 MINS TOTAL TIME: 1  HOUR  30 MINS\nYIELD:Makes 12 2 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaves\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan\n3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled), plus more for pan\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n1 teaspoon fine salt\n1 cup whole milk\n2 tablespoons grated orange zest plus 10 tablespoons orange juice, divided\n2 cups granulated sugar\n4 large eggs\n1 1/2 cups dried cranberries, chopped\n2 cups confectioners' sugar\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.

Fold in cranberries.\nSTEP 2\nTransfer batter to prepared pans and bake until a skewer inserted in center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool in pans on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, 30 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and let cool completely on rack.\nSTEP 3\nWhisk confectioners' sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons juice to make glaze. Drizzle over loaves and let stand until set.

Baked in mini loaf pans, these adorable treats would make lovely holiday gifts for anyone on your list (they can be stored in an airtight container for three days or frozen, unglazed, for three weeks). Of course, the hardest part about gifting this delicious quick bread is getting it out of your own kitchen. Spread some seasonal joy with these cheerful sweets.\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nIf you're really feeling generous, make larger versions of these mini quick breads.

Today's recipe fits that description perfectly; it's a lightened-up version of classic chicken enchiladas. Spiced up with chipotles in adobo and fragrant cumin, this cheesy recipe is one of my absolute favorites. And it's freezer friendly! Double this recipe so you can enjoy it tonight and all season long!\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nChipotles in adobo (i.e., smoked, dried jalapenos in sauce) pack some serious heat. To temper the spice, remove their seeds before cooking.\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREP: 20 MINS TOTAL TIME: 45 MINS\nSERVINGS:4\n\nINGREDIENTS\nCoarse salt and ground pepper\n3 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (6 to 8 ounces each)\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil, such as safflower\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1 to 2 tablespoons minced canned chipotles in adobo\n1 can (14 1/2 ounces) reduced-sodium chicken broth\n8 corn tortillas (6-inch)\n1/2 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese (2 ounces)\n\nCOOK'S NOTE\nChipotles in adobo (smoked, dried jalapenos in sauce) are spicy -- for less heat, scrape out ribs and seeds. You'll find them in the international aisle.\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nIn a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid, bring 1 inch salted water to a boil. Add chicken. Cover; reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer 5 minutes; remove skillet from heat. Let chicken steam, covered, until opaque throughout, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer chicken to a medium bowl; shred with two forks. Set aside.\n\nSTEP 2\nWhile chicken is cooking, make sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add flour, cumin, and chipotles in adobo; cook, whisking, 1 minute. Whisk in broth and 1/2 cup water; bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and cook, whisking occasionally, until sauce has thickened slightly, 5 to 8 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Transfer 1 cup sauce to bowl with chicken; toss to combine.\n\nSTEP 3\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Pour 1/4 cup sauce into bottom of an 8-inch square baking dish; set aside. Stack tortillas, and wrap in a double layer of damp paper towels; microwave until hot, about 1 minute. Fill each tortilla with chicken mixture; roll up tightly, and arrange, seam side down, in baking dish. Cover with remaining sauce, and top with cheese. Bake until hot and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes.

Let sit until pliable, 15 minutes. Reserve 1 cup soaking liquid. Drain guajillos; discard stems and seeds. In a blender, blend guajillos, chipotle chile and sauce, and soaking liquid until smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down side as needed. Pour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl, pressing on solids; discard solids. Set chile puree aside.\nSTEP 2\nHeat a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Season short ribs with salt and pepper and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer to a medium bowl. Add oil to pot, season beef chuck with salt and pepper, and cook until browned, about 5 minutes (do not crowd pot; work in batches if necessary). Transfer to bowl with short ribs.\nSTEP 3\nReduce heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and 1/2 cup water. Cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits with a wooden spoon, until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add cumin, oregano, and cornmeal and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add meat, broth, chile puree, and just enough water to cover meat, if necessary; bring to a boil over high. Partially cover, reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour. Uncover and cook until meat is tender and chili is slightly thickened, 30 to 45 minutes. Add vinegar to taste.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://full.sc/1hHjTVe\n\nMore Beef/Steak Recipes: http://full.sc/PeNWmH\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?

                "description": "I love baking with puff pastry! It's flaky, delicious, and (best of all) ready to use in the freezer section of your grocery store. Today, I'm using puff pastry as the crust in a rustic apple tart. This dessert really couldn't be easier -- just score a border in your pastry before adding your apples and brushing everything with a quick egg wash before baking. After 35 minutes, this beautifully seasonal dessert is ready to serve (we suggest bringing out some vanilla ice cream, too!).\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \n#COOKINWITHSARAH\nAre you making \"Everyday Food\" recipes at home? Tag them on Instagram with the hashtag #COOKINWITHSARAH for the chance to win an EDF cookbook!\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREP: 20 MINS TOTAL TIME: 1  HOUR\nSERVINGS:6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a standard 17.3-ounce package), thawed\nFlour, for work surface\n3 Granny Smith apples\n1/3 cup sugar\n1 large egg yolk, beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 tablespoons apple jelly, or apricot jam\n\nCOOK'S NOTE\nStore-bought frozen puff pastry sometimes cracks along seams when unfolded. To prevent this, leave pastry folded when you roll it.\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees. Open pastry sheet and remove paper. Fold sheet back up. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out pastry sheet (still folded) to an 8-by-14-inch rectangle. Trim edges with a pizza cutter or sharp paring knife. Transfer to a baking sheet; place in freezer. Peel, core, and slice apples 1/4 inch thick. Toss in a large bowl with sugar.\nSTEP 2\nBrush pastry with egg wash, avoiding edges. Use a sharp paring knife to score a 3/4-inch border around pastry (do not cut all the way through). Place apples inside border, and dot with butter. Bake until pastry is golden and apples are tender, 30 to 35 minutes.\nSTEP 3\nIn the microwave or a small saucepan, heat jelly with 1 tablespoon water until melted. Brush apples with glaze. Serve tart warm or at room temperature, cutting into pieces with a serrated knife.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://full.sc/1d2vNJ6\n\nMore Sweet Treat Recipes: http://full.sc/Q9cvnf\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?

                    "description": "I love baking with puff pastry! It's flaky, delicious, and (best of all) ready to use in the freezer section of your grocery store. Today, I'm using puff pastry as the crust in a rustic apple tart. This dessert really couldn't be easier -- just score a border in your pastry before adding your apples and brushing everything with a quick egg wash before baking. After 35 minutes, this beautifully seasonal dessert is ready to serve (we suggest bringing out some vanilla ice cream, too!).\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \n#COOKINWITHSARAH\nAre you making \"Everyday Food\" recipes at home? Tag them on Instagram with the hashtag #COOKINWITHSARAH for the chance to win an EDF cookbook!\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREP: 20 MINS TOTAL TIME: 1  HOUR\nSERVINGS:6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a standard 17.3-ounce package), thawed\nFlour, for work surface\n3 Granny Smith apples\n1/3 cup sugar\n1 large egg yolk, beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 tablespoons apple jelly, or apricot jam\n\nCOOK'S NOTE\nStore-bought frozen puff pastry sometimes cracks along seams when unfolded. To prevent this, leave pastry folded when you roll it.\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees. Open pastry sheet and remove paper. Fold sheet back up. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out pastry sheet (still folded) to an 8-by-14-inch rectangle. Trim edges with a pizza cutter or sharp paring knife. Transfer to a baking sheet; place in freezer. Peel, core, and slice apples 1/4 inch thick. Toss in a large bowl with sugar.\nSTEP 2\nBrush pastry with egg wash, avoiding edges. Use a sharp paring knife to score a 3/4-inch border around pastry (do not cut all the way through). Place apples inside border, and dot with butter. Bake until pastry is golden and apples are tender, 30 to 35 minutes.\nSTEP 3\nIn the microwave or a small saucepan, heat jelly with 1 tablespoon water until melted. Brush apples with glaze. Serve tart warm or at room temperature, cutting into pieces with a serrated knife.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://full.sc/1d2vNJ6\n\nMore Sweet Treat Recipes: http://full.sc/Q9cvnf\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?
