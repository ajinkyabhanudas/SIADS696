Microwave water, 1/2 tsp salt, and dried mushrooms in a large covered bowl until steaming, about 1 minute. Let sit for about 5 minutes until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain mushrooms in a fine-mesh strainer, reserving liquid.\n2. Set soaked mushrooms aside and return liquid to the large bowl.\n3. Place peppercorns in a small bowl and microwave until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds. Let cool completely. Once cool, grind in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle (you should have 1 \u00bd  tsp).\n4. Using the side of the chef's knife, lightly crush white parts of scallions, then cut scallions into 1-inch pieces. Place tofu and scallions in a bowl with the reserved mushroom liquid and microwave for 5-7 minutes until steaming. Let it rest while preparing the remaining ingredients.\n5. Process garlic, ginger, chili paste, and black beans in a food processor until coarse paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add \u00bc cup vegetable oil, chili powder, and 1 tsp peppercorns and continue to process until smooth paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer spice paste to the bowl.\n6. Place reserved soaked mushrooms and fresh shiitake mushrooms in a now-empty processor and pulse until finely chopped, 15 to 20 pulses (do not overprocess). Heat 2 Tbsp vegetable oil and mushroom mixture in a large saucepan over medium heat, breaking up mushrooms with a wooden spoon until mushrooms begin to brown and stick to the bottom of the saucepan, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer mushroom mixture to the bowl.\n7. Add remaining 2 Tbsp vegetable oil and spice paste to the now-empty saucepan and cook, stirring frequently, until paste darkens and oil begins to separate from paste, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently pour tofu with mushroom liquid into the saucepan, followed by hoisin, sesame oil, and mushroom mixture. Cook, gently stirring frequently, until the dish comes to simmer, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk soy sauce and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Add cornstarch mixture to the saucepan and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes longer. \n8. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with remaining peppercorns and serve. (Mapo tofu can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)\n\nBabish Cookware on Amazon: http://bit.ly/babishstore\n\nMy playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish!\nhttps://spoti.fi/2TYXmiY\n\nBCU TikTok: https://bit.ly/2PLtohe\nBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsite\nBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsite\nBCU Discord: https://bit.ly/3ALFRnY\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreon\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagram\nSubreddit: https://bit.ly/3mkNpp6\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter",

To try out Lightroom for yourself, click here: https://adobe.ly/2ZJRUUZ\n\nThis week, @Ethan Chlebowski joins us to tackle a question for the ages: just how do you make a guilt-free pizza that also, you know, tastes like pizza? The answer lies in a Roman specialty known as \"Pinsa\": a light, airy, chewy flatbread with fewer calories, more fiber, and more protein than its Neapolitan counterpart. Is it diet food? No. Does it look/taste/feel/smell/sound exactly like the real deal, all while delivering more of the nutrients your body so dearly needs? Yes!\n\nCheck out Ethan\u2019s Pinsa episode here: https://youtu.be/VtNrfooHl_g\n\nGet the brand-new Ooni Karu 16 multi-fuel pizza oven as seen in today\u2019s episode here: https://ooni.com/babish-culinary-universe\n\nBabish Cookware on Amazon: http://bit.ly/babishstore\n\nRecipe: https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/protein-pizza\n\nMusic by Chillhop: http://chillhop.com/listen\nBlue Wednesday - Sweet Berry Wine, 90s Kid\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday\nListen on Spotify: http://bit.ly/ChillhopSpotify\n\nMy playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish!\nhttps://spoti.fi/2TYXmiY\n\nBCU TikTok: https://bit.ly/2PLtohe\nBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsite\nBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsite\nBCU Discord: https://bit.ly/3ALFRnY\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreon\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagram\nSubreddit: https://bit.ly/3mkNpp6\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter",

To try out Lightroom for yourself, click here: https://adobe.ly/2ZJRUUZ\n\nThis week, @Ethan Chlebowski joins us to tackle a question for the ages: just how do you make a guilt-free pizza that also, you know, tastes like pizza? The answer lies in a Roman specialty known as \"Pinsa\": a light, airy, chewy flatbread with fewer calories, more fiber, and more protein than its Neapolitan counterpart. Is it diet food? No. Does it look/taste/feel/smell/sound exactly like the real deal, all while delivering more of the nutrients your body so dearly needs? Yes!\n\nCheck out Ethan\u2019s Pinsa episode here: https://youtu.be/VtNrfooHl_g\n\nGet the brand-new Ooni Karu 16 multi-fuel pizza oven as seen in today\u2019s episode here: https://ooni.com/babish-culinary-universe\n\nBabish Cookware on Amazon: http://bit.ly/babishstore\n\nRecipe: https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/protein-pizza\n\nMusic by Chillhop: http://chillhop.com/listen\nBlue Wednesday - Sweet Berry Wine, 90s Kid\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday\nListen on Spotify: http://bit.ly/ChillhopSpotify\n\nMy playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish!\nhttps://spoti.fi/2TYXmiY\n\nBCU TikTok: https://bit.ly/2PLtohe\nBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsite\nBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsite\nBCU Discord: https://bit.ly/3ALFRnY\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreon\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagram\nSubreddit: https://bit.ly/3mkNpp6\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter"

To watch the full Mixing with Babish series, head to their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/makersmark/\n\nFrom Colon Blow to Taco Town to Shweddy Balls, SNL is known for its sometimes-temping, often-disgusting food parodies. Most pale in comparison, however, to the Overnight Salad: dripping with mid-century mayonnaise overdose, this send-up of 1950s American \"cuisine\" has been haunting me since its premiere last spring, and now finally it's here. Along with a practical version, because as it turns out, overnight salads are an actual thing for some reason.

Instead, we're focusing on the food: brie and baguette sandwiches, fresh from Paris, furnished by an unhealthy relationship with a younger sibling. Brie and butter on a baguette isn't just a delicious-sounding alliteration - it's a classic French sandwich that actually lives up to the hype. Sometimes a few simple ingredients can come together to create something greater than the sum of their parts, and there are few finer examples than this comforting, indulgent mixture of fat and carbs.\n\nMusic: \"A Beautiful Life\" by Broke for Free\nhttps://soundcloud.com/broke-for-free\n\nRecipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/brie-butter-baguette-twin-peaks\n\nMy playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish!\nhttps://spoti.fi/2TYXmiY\n\nBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsite\nBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsite\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreon\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagram\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter",

                    "description": "This week we're headed back to Twin Peaks WA, but for once, not with murder on the mind. Instead, we're focusing on the food: brie and baguette sandwiches, fresh from Paris, furnished by an unhealthy relationship with a younger sibling. Brie and butter on a baguette isn't just a delicious-sounding alliteration - it's a classic French sandwich that actually lives up to the hype. Sometimes a few simple ingredients can come together to create something greater than the sum of their parts, and there are few finer examples than this comforting, indulgent mixture of fat and carbs.\n\nMusic: \"A Beautiful Life\" by Broke for Free\nhttps://soundcloud.com/broke-for-free\n\nRecipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/brie-butter-baguette-twin-peaks\n\nMy playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish!\nhttps://spoti.fi/2TYXmiY\n\nBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsite\nBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsite\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreon\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagram\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter"

In a dish that embodies the spirit of the movie itself, a hot dog is tucked delicately into a Twinkie and judiciously sprayed with cheese - and you know what? It's not that bad.

Start by cutting your bread of choice into thick slices. Place onto a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Leave out overnight uncovered, or preheat the oven to its lowest temperature and place the bread in for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through. Either way, your bread should be nice and dry.\n2. For the classic custard, in a large bowl combine 1 \u00bd cups of whole milk, 2 large eggs, 3-4 tablespoons of granulated white sugar, 1-2 teaspoons of real vanilla extract, and \u00bd teaspoon each of ground cinnamon and nutmeg. Whisk together until combined and no streaks of egg remain.  \n3. For fancy french toast custard, in a large bowl combine 1 \u00bd cups of half & half or heavy cream, 3-4 egg yolks, 3-4 tablespoons of dark brown sugar, 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla paste or one scraped vanilla bean, \u00bd teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg, the zest of a lemon or orange, and a splash of either bourbon, rum, or brandy. Whisk together until fully combined. \n4. Once the custard is ready, pour it into a cake pan or pie plate. Grab a piece of thickly cut bread and drop it into the custard, letting it sit for 20-30 seconds on each side. \n5. Heat 2 tablespoons of melted butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the soaked bread to the skillet and let the bread fry for 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. \n6. Place onto a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a 350\u00b0F oven while you cook all of the pieces.\n7. Once every piece of toast is complete, stack on a plate, topped with butter and maple syrup. \n8. For a tangy butter for the chocolate babka, whip together 8 ounces of room temperature cream cheese with 3 tablespoons of sugar and a pinch of salt.\n\nFrench Toast Casserole Method:\n1. Start by cutting a large loaf of brioche bread into large cubes. Generously butter a casserole dish, making sure to get every inch. Fill dish with the pieces of bread cubes. \n2. For the custard, into a large bowl goes 1 \u00bd cups of whole milk, 5 large eggs, 3-4 tablespoons of granulated white sugar, 1-2 teaspoons of real vanilla extract, and \u00bd teaspoon each of ground cinnamon and nutmeg. Whisk together until combined and no streaks of egg remain. \n3. Then pour the custard evenly all over the bread cubes, making sure that every piece is saturated. For good measure, give it a nice messy toss for even custard distribution. \n4. Wipe down any mess created from tossing the bread cubes, then cover the dish with a lid. Place in the fridge overnight to bake the next day, or you can bake it immediately. \n5. When ready to bake, prepare the topping. In a small bowl, combine 4 tablespoons of melted butter, 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of kosher salt. Whisk until completely combined then set aside. \n6. Chop a handful of pecans then scatter across the top of the casserole. Then drizzle evenly with the brown sugar butter mixture. Top it off with a few generous pinches of turbinado sugar.   \n7. Place into a 350\u00b0F oven for 35-45 minutes, rotating halfway through baking. Remove when golden brown. Let rest for at least 10 minutes. \n8. After 10 minutes, slice and serve, topping with butter and maple syrup. \n\nMusic by Chillhop: http://chillhop.com/listen\nBlue Wednesday - \"'Sweet Berry Wine\", \"Murmuration (feat.

[Insert joke about stealing sweetrolls here].\n\n\nRecipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/skyrim-sweetrolls\n\n\n\nMusic: \"XXV\" by Broke for Free\nhttps://soundcloud.com/broke-for-free\n\nMy playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish! \nhttps://spoti.fi/2TYXmiY\n\nBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsite\nBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsite\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreon\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagram\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter"

In a stainless steel pan, preheat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Once shimmering, add the diced onion and sweat the onions for 3 minutes over moderate heat. \nOnce translucent and soft, add in 2-3 cloves of garlic and saute for an additional 30 seconds before adding 1 teaspoon of ras el hanout, \u00bd teaspoon of aleppo pepper, and \u00bd teaspoon of whole cumin seeds. Toast the spices for about 30 seconds, and remove the pan from the heat if it starts to get too hot. \n2. After toasting for 30 seconds or until very fragrant, add in a 28 ounce can of fire roasted tomatoes. If your tomatoes are whole, crush them up with a spoon in the pan. Bring that to a simmer and add \u00bc teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika, 1 \u00bd teaspoons of harissa paste, and \u00bd cup of roasted red pepper. \n3. Once everything is added, bring it to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the sauce thickens. \n4. After the sauce has thickened and small egg divots can be formed, use a spoon to form a well in the sauce and crack an egg inside each well. I usually make 4 or 5 eggs.\n5. Gently spoon the sauce up and around the whites of each egg to help them cook more evenly. Lower the heat, cover with the lid and let it gently simmer for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes make sure the whites of the eggs have set. \n6. Remove from the heat and begin dressing it up with a variety of toppings. I recommend some crumbled feta cheese, chopped parsley, and a drizzle of honey. Serve alongside some good bread.\n\nItalian-Inspired Shakshuka Recipe:\nIngredients\n-Spicy Italian Sausage\n-\u00bc cup diced onion\n-5 whole garlic cloves, crushed\n-\u00bc cup sun-dried tomatoes\n-28 oz can crushed tomatoes\n-\u00bc cup basil, chopped\n-4-5 large eggs\n-Low moisture mozzarella, sliced into pieces\n-Parmesan cheese (for garnish)\n-Fresh basil (for garnish)\n-Crusty bread (for serving)\n\n1. Start by cooking some spicy Italian sausage in a little oil over medium high heat. Break the sausage into pieces with your spoon and saute over medium heat for 4-5 minutes until it has nicely browned. Set sausage aside.\n2. Add the diced onion and then sweat in the sausage fat for 3 minutes over moderate heat. \n3. Once translucent and soft, add in 5 whole crushed cloves of garlic and 1 tablespoon of sun-dried tomatoes. Saute until everything is fragrant and add 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes and \u00bc cup of chopped basil. \n4. Add the sausage back to the pan, mix everything together and let simmer for 20-30 minutes, until it has reached the right thickness. \n5. Make little wells and add an egg to each well. Add a few pieces of low-moisture mozzarella to the top of the sauce as well. Lower the heat, cover with a lid, and let stew for 5 minutes before checking to make sure the egg whites have set.\n6. Plate and garnish immediately with some freshly grated parmesan and fresh basil. Serve with some good bread.\n\nMexican-Inspired Shakshuka Recipe:\nIngredients\n-Chorizo\n-\u00bc cup onion, diced\n-5 whole garlic cloves, crushed \n-\u00bd tsp whole cumin seeds\n-1 Tbsp smoked paprika\n-28 oz can crushed tomatoes\n-4-5 large eggs\n-1 jalapeno, sliced\n-Manchego cheese\n-Cilantro (for garnish)\n-Tortillas (for serving)\n\n1. Start by cooking some chorizo in a little oil. Use your spoon to break up the sausage and saute over medium heat for 4-5 minutes, until nicely browned. Set aside. \n2. Add the diced onion and sweat the onions in the chorizo fat for 3 minutes over moderate heat.  \n3. Once translucent and soft, add in 5 whole crushed cloves of garlic, \u00bd teaspoon of whole cumin seeds, and 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika. Saute until everything is fragrant and then add 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes. \n4.

This week, blatantly disregard your cholesterol levels and fire up a Lucky Strike as we indulge in some hotel-room-hedonism with our silver fox boss.\n\nRecipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/6/27/madmen\n\nMusic: \"A Beautiful Life\" by Broke for Free\nhttps://soundcloud.com/broke-for-free\n\nBabish Cookware on Amazon: http://bit.ly/babishstore\n\nPlease support Binging with Babish!

Mix with fingers until just combined, and sprinkle with water.  Knead until a sticky dough forms.  Turn out onto a lightly floured tabletop, and knead rigorously (slap onto the table about 100 times), until the dough is soft and supple.  Place in a lightly oiled bowl and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\nCombine apples, sugar, lemon zest, raisins, and cinnamon.  Set aside and let liquid weep from apples.\n\nCover a large table with a cotton tablecloth, and liberally dust with flour.  Roll out dough on tablecloth until about 24\" in diameter, and using floured fists, stretch dough out as large as possible without tearing.  Back on the tablecloth, gently tug at edges of dough until it's a rectangle thin enough to see the pattern of the tablecloth underneath.  Trim off torn/thick edges.  Drizzle with melted butter, and brush until evenly coated.  Sprinkle with chopped nuts.\n\nPlace about 3/4 of apple mixture on one side of the dough rectangle, and using the tablecloth, roll the apples over onto the dough square.  Brush the newly-exposed dough covering the apples with melted butter.  Roll apples over again, and repeat, until apples are at the center of a long, closed roll.  Pinch ends together to seal contents inside, and place seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Brush liberally with a beaten egg.\n\nBake for about an hour, basting with melted butter every 10-15 minutes, as soon as the crust begins to look dry.  Remove from oven when golden brown.  Allow to cool at least one hour before slicing, dusting with powdered sugar, and serving.\n\nIn a small bowl, combine cream and sugar.  Beat to stiff peaks, and pipe into a bowl, served alongside strudel.",

Once all beef has browned, and fond has formed on the bottom of the pot, add remaining oil, and saut\u00e9 onions and peppers until sweating.  Deglaze with beer, and scrape the bottom of the pot.  Add remaining ingredients, stir well, and place in a 300F oven, lid slightly ajar.  Stir occasionally to prevent scorching, and braise for 2-3 hours, until beef is tender.  Season with salt and pepper, and serve with cheese and cornbread."

Add onions, saut\u00e9 until translucent, add tomato paste and garlic and saut\u00e9 until fragrant. Deglaze with wine, scraping up all the good stuff on the bottom of the pot.  Add tomatoes, crushing with a spoon (or processing with a food mill if desired), and return meats to the pot.  Add basil and carrot, and bring to a bare simmer.  Let sauce simmer for hours, stirring and scraping the bottom occasionally (don't let anything stick - it will scorch and ruin your sauce).  Add meatballs during the final hour of cooking, and simmer until desired consistency is reached.\n\nRemove carrots and beef/veal bones - add a spoonful of sauce to coat some freshly-cooked pasta (preferably something ridged so it holds onto lots of sauce), and serve with meat and extra gravy.  Top with parmesan.

Follow along as we make old-school Sunday gravy, and please, try not to piss off Tommy.  Recipe below!\n\nRecipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/6/15/goodfellasprisonsauce\n\nMusic: \"Cream on Chrome\" by Ratatat\n\nRECIPE\n---\n\n*Ingredients*\n-3 cloves garlic, cut paper-thin\n-3 small onions (keyword: small) chopped\n-1 lb each sweet and spicy italian sausage\n-1 beef shank\n-1lb veal neck bones w/ meat attached\n-1 glug red wine\n-3 cans DOP San Marzano tomatoes\n-1 tbsp tomato paste\n-2 large stems fresh basil\n-1 large carrot, peeled and cut into big chunks\n-1lb meatballs\n-Olive oil or butter for finishing (optional)\n-Parmesan cheese (not optional)\n\n*Method*\n\nIn a large stock pot, brown the sausage, beef, and veal in batches until well browned and fond has formed on the bottom of the pot.  Add onions, saut\u00e9 until translucent, add tomato paste and garlic and saut\u00e9 until fragrant. Deglaze with wine, scraping up all the good stuff on the bottom of the pot.  Add tomatoes, crushing with a spoon (or processing with a food mill if desired), and return meats to the pot.  Add basil and carrot, and bring to a bare simmer.  Let sauce simmer for hours, stirring and scraping the bottom occasionally (don't let anything stick - it will scorch and ruin your sauce).  Add meatballs during the final hour of cooking, and simmer until desired consistency is reached.\n\nRemove carrots and beef/veal bones - add a spoonful of sauce to coat some freshly-cooked pasta (preferably something ridged so it holds onto lots of sauce), and serve with meat and extra gravy.  Top with parmesan.  Eat.\n\nWatch in Spanish here: https://youtu.be/7xBE2aIAeTg\n\nBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsite\nBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsite\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreon\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagram\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter"
