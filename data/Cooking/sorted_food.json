This recipe is a foolproof and delicious take on the epic frozen Italian dessert.\n\nMake it yourself: http://bit.ly/GourmetGranitas\nTropical Carrot Cake:\nWith the saved orange pulp, a great use is to combine 250g of it with 175g of plain flour, 175g soft brown sugar, 1 tsp of baking powder, 2 eggs, 100ml of sunflower oil and a handful of chopped up dried mango to give you a tropically spiced carrot cake batter that only needs baking off for 50 minutes at 160\u2103 to give you something really quite special.\n\nFor more information on Kenwood products and the PureJuice juicer seen in this video head here: http://bit.ly/KenwoodWorld3\n\nWanna become an awesome home cook?

This recipe is a foolproof and delicious take on the epic frozen Italian dessert.\n\nMake it yourself: http://bit.ly/GourmetGranitas\nTropical Carrot Cake:\nWith the saved orange pulp, a great use is to combine 250g of it with 175g of plain flour, 175g soft brown sugar, 1 tsp of baking powder, 2 eggs, 100ml of sunflower oil and a handful of chopped up dried mango to give you a tropically spiced carrot cake batter that only needs baking off for 50 minutes at 160\u2103 to give you something really quite special.\n\nFor more information on Kenwood products and the PureJuice juicer seen in this video head here: http://bit.ly/KenwoodWorld3\n\nWanna become an awesome home cook?

Next up plenty of German mustard-spiked sour cream and then the star of the burger... the flattened German pork meatball spiced with flavours from the classic Lebkuchen biscuit and covered in schnitzel-style golden fried breadcrumbs. Topped with slithers of grilled salami, then raw crunchy red cabbage followed by tangy sauerkraut. Before the lid of the shiny roll, the burger is completed with a split, char-grilled Bavarian frankfurter and sweet caramelised onions.\n\nGet the full recipe here: http://bit.ly/1vnEgNN\n\nCheck out our Collab with Flula here: http://bit.ly/1tmqojL\n\nWanna become an awesome home cook?

Next up plenty of German mustard-spiked sour cream and then the star of the burger... the flattened German pork meatball spiced with flavours from the classic Lebkuchen biscuit and covered in schnitzel-style golden fried breadcrumbs. Topped with slithers of grilled salami, then raw crunchy red cabbage followed by tangy sauerkraut. Before the lid of the shiny roll, the burger is completed with a split, char-grilled Bavarian frankfurter and sweet caramelised onions.\n\nGet the full recipe here: http://bit.ly/1vnEgNN\n\nCheck out our Collab with Flula here: http://bit.ly/1tmqojL\n\nWanna become an awesome home cook?

This lacto-free and bread free burger is not for the faint-hearted! An impressively-sized beef burger seasoned with mustard powder and draped with a sunny side up fried egg sits in between. To cut through the richness enjoy slices of juicy beef tomato, some homemade cider vinegar pickled red onions infused with star anise, cloves and peppercorns and a generous dollop of creamy dill mayonnaise. You may need a knife and fork\u2026 but you sure won\u2019t want to leave any on the plate! It's elegantly trashy!\n\nWe\u2019re on a quest to find the internet\u2019s ultimate burger and this suggestion came from top YouTuber and all round brilliant creator, Grace Helbig.

This lacto-free and bread free burger is not for the faint-hearted! An impressively-sized beef burger seasoned with mustard powder and draped with a sunny side up fried egg sits in between. To cut through the richness enjoy slices of juicy beef tomato, some homemade cider vinegar pickled red onions infused with star anise, cloves and peppercorns and a generous dollop of creamy dill mayonnaise. You may need a knife and fork\u2026 but you sure won\u2019t want to leave any on the plate! It's elegantly trashy!\n\nWe\u2019re on a quest to find the internet\u2019s ultimate burger and this suggestion came from top YouTuber and all round brilliant creator, Grace Helbig.
