                "description": "Join Tiana Gee AKA Chef Tee as she makes the ULTIMATE breakfast sandwich. She stacks scrambled eggs, chicken sausage made from scratch, cheddar cheese and hot pepper jelly between homemade biscuits. For the sausage, Tee takes inspiration from Filipino longanisa, a flavorful sausage often served for breakfast. For extra flaky biscuits don't forget to freeze your butter ahead of time!\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS: \r\nFor the sausage: \r\n\u00bd lb. ground chicken \r\n1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes\r\n2 Tbsp. light brown sugar \r\n\u00bc cup banana ketchup\r\n2 Tbsp. soy sauce \r\n2 cloves garlic, grated\r\n4 sage leaves, finely chopped\r\n2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper\r\nKosher salt\r\nFor the biscuits: \r\n2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for shaping \r\n1 Tbsp. baking powder \r\n\u00bc tsp. baking soda \r\n2 tsp. kosher salt \r\n6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, frozen and cut into small pieces\r\n1 cup buttermilk \r\n1 large egg, for egg wash\r\nMelted butter\r\nMaldon salt\r\nHoney\r\nFor assembly:\r\n6 large eggs, scrambled  \r\n4 slices yellow sharp cheddar cheese\r\n1 cup arugula\r\nChives, minced\r\nVegetable Oil \r\nUnsalted butter\r\nHot pepper jelly\r\nKosher salt\r\nFreshly ground black pepper\r\n\r\nPreparation: \r\n\r\n1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. \r\n2. Make the sausage mix and set in the fridge while prepping other ingredients. Combine all sausage ingredients into a bowl and mix until well combined and protein is emulsified. Refrigerate until chilled. \r\n3. Make the biscuit dough. Mix all dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Cut in the cold butter with your fingers until it resembles small little crumbs. Add in the buttermilk and combine into dough. Once into a dough transfer onto a lightly floured surface to prevent from sticking. Knead slightly until combined. Roll dough out into a 1 in thickness. Fold the dough a few times to create layers. And roll into 1 in thick rectangle shape. Trim off the edges and cut into 6 biscuits square shaped. Place onto a baking tray, brush with egg wash and bake for 10 minutes. Brush with butter. Top with flaky maldon salt. Back into oven for about 4 minutes. Drizzle with honey.\r\n4. In a bowl whisk eggs and season with salt and pepper. Form 4 sausage patties using oiled hands.

She stacks scrambled eggs, chicken sausage made from scratch, cheddar cheese and hot pepper jelly between homemade biscuits. For the sausage, Tee takes inspiration from Filipino longanisa, a flavorful sausage often served for breakfast. For extra flaky biscuits don't forget to freeze your butter ahead of time!\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS: \r\nFor the sausage: \r\n\u00bd lb. ground chicken \r\n1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes\r\n2 Tbsp. light brown sugar \r\n\u00bc cup banana ketchup\r\n2 Tbsp. soy sauce \r\n2 cloves garlic, grated\r\n4 sage leaves, finely chopped\r\n2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper\r\nKosher salt\r\nFor the biscuits: \r\n2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for shaping \r\n1 Tbsp. baking powder \r\n\u00bc tsp. baking soda \r\n2 tsp. kosher salt \r\n6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, frozen and cut into small pieces\r\n1 cup buttermilk \r\n1 large egg, for egg wash\r\nMelted butter\r\nMaldon salt\r\nHoney\r\nFor assembly:\r\n6 large eggs, scrambled  \r\n4 slices yellow sharp cheddar cheese\r\n1 cup arugula\r\nChives, minced\r\nVegetable Oil \r\nUnsalted butter\r\nHot pepper jelly\r\nKosher salt\r\nFreshly ground black pepper\r\n\r\nPreparation: \r\n\r\n1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. \r\n2. Make the sausage mix and set in the fridge while prepping other ingredients. Combine all sausage ingredients into a bowl and mix until well combined and protein is emulsified. Refrigerate until chilled. \r\n3. Make the biscuit dough. Mix all dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Cut in the cold butter with your fingers until it resembles small little crumbs. Add in the buttermilk and combine into dough. Once into a dough transfer onto a lightly floured surface to prevent from sticking. Knead slightly until combined. Roll dough out into a 1 in thickness. Fold the dough a few times to create layers. And roll into 1 in thick rectangle shape. Trim off the edges and cut into 6 biscuits square shaped. Place onto a baking tray, brush with egg wash and bake for 10 minutes. Brush with butter. Top with flaky maldon salt. Back into oven for about 4 minutes. Drizzle with honey.\r\n4. In a bowl whisk eggs and season with salt and pepper. Form 4 sausage patties using oiled hands.  Bring a pan to medium high heat and add butter. Add eggs into pan and scramble. Add chives. Add cheese to the top. Cook sausage in a little bit of oil until browned on both sides.\r\n5. Once biscuits are done. Split them in half. Spread with pepper jelly then add sausage, egg with cheese and arugula. \r\n\r\n\r\nVIDEO BREAKDOWN\r\n0:00 Introduction\r\n00:38 Make chicken sausage mixture\r\n02:28 Make biscuits\r\n06:16 Bake biscuits at 450\u00b0 for 10 minutes\r\n06:21 Brush biscuits with butter, sprinkle with maldon salt\r\n06:33 Bake again for 4 minutes, drizzle with honey\r\n07:04 Beat eggs, chop chives\r\n07:47 Form patties\r\n08:25 Cook sausage \r\n09:10 Scramble eggs\r\n10:10 Assemble sandos\r\n11:19 Plating\r\n12:01 Tasting\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

We challenged Harold to make his own General Tso's chicken with fried rice faster than it takes for delivery to arrive. Was he up to the challenge?\r\nLooking for a way to support restaurants and cook at home? Do as Harold does in this new video and take on takeout: order your personal favorite delivery dishes and try to cook them at home in the same time it takes for them to arrive. You\u2019ll be putting money into the restaurant industry, challenging yourself, and you'll have double the food. See if Harold, who grew up eating General Tso\u2019s chicken at countless Chinese-American spots in The Bronx, can create a version similar to the takeout one.\r\n\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

                    "description": "Harold Villarosa, like many of us, grew up eating General Tso's chicken. It's a takeout staple that you've probably ordered at some point. We challenged Harold to make his own General Tso's chicken with fried rice faster than it takes for delivery to arrive. Was he up to the challenge?\r\nLooking for a way to support restaurants and cook at home? Do as Harold does in this new video and take on takeout: order your personal favorite delivery dishes and try to cook them at home in the same time it takes for them to arrive. You\u2019ll be putting money into the restaurant industry, challenging yourself, and you'll have double the food. See if Harold, who grew up eating General Tso\u2019s chicken at countless Chinese-American spots in The Bronx, can create a version similar to the takeout one.\r\n\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

                "description": "Join Amiel Stanek in his home kitchen as he makes doughnut bread pudding. This recipe is a great way to use up stale doughnuts, but if you\u2019ve got freshly made ones, that works too. Start with classic glazed or sugar-coated yeasted doughnuts, which have a light and airy texture, rather than cake doughnuts, which are dense and will turn to mush when combined with the custard. The bread pudding will puff heroically near the end of its baking time, like a souffl\u00e9, but fall shortly after it comes out of the oven; don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s supposed to do that! The final texture is somewhere between an eggy bread pudding and a clafoutis, and it\u2019s pretty hard to stop eating.\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/day-old-doughnut-bread-pudding\r\n\r\nBon App\u00e9tit stands with the Black Community in the fight against police brutality and systemic racism.\r\nRead more here: https://www.youtube.com/post/UgwincC1IY8_3jMMqQV4AaABCQ\r\nAmiel is supporting Campaign Zero: https://www.joincampaignzero.org/\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

                    "description": "Join Amiel Stanek in his home kitchen as he makes doughnut bread pudding. This recipe is a great way to use up stale doughnuts, but if you\u2019ve got freshly made ones, that works too. Start with classic glazed or sugar-coated yeasted doughnuts, which have a light and airy texture, rather than cake doughnuts, which are dense and will turn to mush when combined with the custard. The bread pudding will puff heroically near the end of its baking time, like a souffl\u00e9, but fall shortly after it comes out of the oven; don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s supposed to do that! The final texture is somewhere between an eggy bread pudding and a clafoutis, and it\u2019s pretty hard to stop eating.\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/day-old-doughnut-bread-pudding\r\n\r\nBon App\u00e9tit stands with the Black Community in the fight against police brutality and systemic racism.\r\nRead more here: https://www.youtube.com/post/UgwincC1IY8_3jMMqQV4AaABCQ\r\nAmiel is supporting Campaign Zero: https://www.joincampaignzero.org/\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

Let\u2019s get one thing straight: We love chicken parm, but we\u2019ve had our fair share of mediocre versions. So we took it upon ourselves to do a deep dive into this iconic dish, and come up with what we deemed our ideal recipe. In the end, that means we kept the cutlets a little bit thicker so they wouldn\u2019t get overcooked. We gave them a shallow fry to achieve a crispy, evenly golden-brown breading. We blanketed them in a simple yet rich tomato sauce, which gets extra depth from tomato paste. And as for the cheese, we landed on a combo of Parmesan, for its salty edge, and mozzarella, for its creamy ooey-gooey texture.

                "description": "Join Molly Baz in her home Test Kitchen (and her dad in his kitchen) as she makes sour cream and onion biscuits. If you've ever had trouble making biscuits in the past, consider this recipe your saving grace. While many other methods count on pockets of butter and an angel\u2019s touch for pull-apart flakiness, we weren't willing to leave it to chance. Our simple folding technique manually multiplies the number of layers for guaranteed, no-risk success. And the sour cream isn\u2019t just a gimmick. Used in place of the more typical cream or buttermilk, it adds rich, tangy flavor, and acidity that helps make the biscuits incredibly light and tender. These are at their peak when they\u2019re warm out of the oven. Plan accordingly.\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sour-cream-and-onion-biscuits\r\nCheck out Molly's Joshua Tree AirBnB here: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21028165\r\n#stayhome cook #withme\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

                    "description": "Join Molly Baz in her home Test Kitchen (and her dad in his kitchen) as she makes sour cream and onion biscuits. If you've ever had trouble making biscuits in the past, consider this recipe your saving grace. While many other methods count on pockets of butter and an angel\u2019s touch for pull-apart flakiness, we weren't willing to leave it to chance. Our simple folding technique manually multiplies the number of layers for guaranteed, no-risk success. And the sour cream isn\u2019t just a gimmick. Used in place of the more typical cream or buttermilk, it adds rich, tangy flavor, and acidity that helps make the biscuits incredibly light and tender. These are at their peak when they\u2019re warm out of the oven. Plan accordingly.\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sour-cream-and-onion-biscuits\r\nCheck out Molly's Joshua Tree AirBnB here: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21028165\r\n#stayhome cook #withme\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

He's joined by Rawia Bishara, a fixture in Palestinian cooking, to introduce him to the essentials of her culinary heritage at her restaurant Tanoreen. She teaches Andy how to cook three dishes: fatoush, makloobeh and knafeh.\r\nCheck out one of Rawia's recipes from Tanoreen here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/musakhan\r\nAt Tanoreen in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, chef Rawia Bishara prepares her version of musakhan, a staple Palestinian slow-cooked chicken dish smothered in silky onions and bright, lemony sumac, set on top of flatbread. Traditionally it\u2019s made by roasting a whole chicken, but here it\u2019s broken down into parts for easier browning and faster cooking. When serving, don\u2019t forget about tearing off pieces of the bread: It will have soaked up some of the juices from the chicken and the sweet onions.\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

                    "description": "Andy Baraghani is on to his next exploration and this time it's Palestinian cooking. He's joined by Rawia Bishara, a fixture in Palestinian cooking, to introduce him to the essentials of her culinary heritage at her restaurant Tanoreen. She teaches Andy how to cook three dishes: fatoush, makloobeh and knafeh.\r\nCheck out one of Rawia's recipes from Tanoreen here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/musakhan\r\nAt Tanoreen in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, chef Rawia Bishara prepares her version of musakhan, a staple Palestinian slow-cooked chicken dish smothered in silky onions and bright, lemony sumac, set on top of flatbread. Traditionally it\u2019s made by roasting a whole chicken, but here it\u2019s broken down into parts for easier browning and faster cooking. When serving, don\u2019t forget about tearing off pieces of the bread: It will have soaked up some of the juices from the chicken and the sweet onions.\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

At the time, they couldn\u2019t have known they would become the biggest pop act of the decade, but with the perfect blend of talent, timing and dedication their ascension seems almost preordained in retrospect. Jimmy Redd\u2019s swooning vocals, Janet Cherry\u2019s lead guitar, Bill Lemon\u2019s bouncy bass and Martha Green\u2019s driving drums were met by screaming fans from Kansas to Kyoto. The songs \u201cMy Sugar Kid\u201d (1965) and \u201cYour Sour Smile\u201d (1967) are now considered important contributions to the American music canon.\r\nThese were the good years. The band\u2019s legend grew and the money poured in. Their label, Sweet Sounds Music Group, pushed them to reach their audiences in new ways, building out their merchandising arm into clothing, lunch boxes and even a sour sugar-coated gummy candy. However, the label was also arguably responsible for the band\u2019s downfall. In response to slightly drooping numbers, the label, citing a clause in the band\u2019s contract that the four excited teenagers did not notice before signing back in 1964, added a new member to the group: Barry Blue. The new member of The Sour Patch Kids was not well received, within the band or by the fans. Critics considered his music style to be a step backwards to the band\u2019s earliest sound, which many considered them to have grown out of. And in May of 1969, the creative differences came to a head and the band broke up. The label had the original four members blacklisted and they stopped making music all together. The only remnant of their success is the music they made and the Sour Patch Kids candy which remains popular to this day. \r\nCheck out Claire's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/csaffitz/\r\n\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

                "description": "Join Claire Saffitz in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen as she attempts to make gourmet M&M's. M&M's are available in just about every color known to man, but there is one color that is objectively the best: green. Scientists have puzzled over this curiosity since the inception of M&M's in 1941. MIT Professor of Cognitive Sciences Dr. Bertrand Mathers has dedicated the entirety of his postdoctoral studies to this conundrum, labeling it the Green M&M Dilemma. With the dedicated assistance of researcher Loretta Marshall, Mathers has finally unveiled his ultimate theory on the subject. \u201cAfter more than fifty years of sleepless nights, proposed and rejected ideas and quite a few cavities,\u201d Dr. Mathers read from a lectern at an August 15, 2019 press conference, \u201cMy life\u2019s work has finally reached its culmination. I have found the solution to the Green M&M Dilemma.\u201d Dr. Mathers, never one to skimp on dramatics, spun around to face a chalkboard covered by a red velvet curtain. Pulling it aside, he revealed his grand solution: \u2018The color green is the best color, so therefore green M&M\u2019s are the best M&M\u2019s.\u2019 A stunned silence in the crowd was quickly following by a standing ovation lasting over five minutes. Finally, as the applause died down, Dr. Mathers, red-cheeked and clutching a bottle of celebratory champagne, added: \u201cAnd now we begin our studies into why blue M&M\u2019s are definitely the next best M&M\u2019s!\u201d\r\nCheck out Claire's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/csaffitz/\r\n\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

                    "description": "Join Claire Saffitz in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen as she attempts to make gourmet M&M's. M&M's are available in just about every color known to man, but there is one color that is objectively the best: green. Scientists have puzzled over this curiosity since the inception of M&M's in 1941. MIT Professor of Cognitive Sciences Dr. Bertrand Mathers has dedicated the entirety of his postdoctoral studies to this conundrum, labeling it the Green M&M Dilemma. With the dedicated assistance of researcher Loretta Marshall, Mathers has finally unveiled his ultimate theory on the subject. \u201cAfter more than fifty years of sleepless nights, proposed and rejected ideas and quite a few cavities,\u201d Dr. Mathers read from a lectern at an August 15, 2019 press conference, \u201cMy life\u2019s work has finally reached its culmination. I have found the solution to the Green M&M Dilemma.\u201d Dr. Mathers, never one to skimp on dramatics, spun around to face a chalkboard covered by a red velvet curtain. Pulling it aside, he revealed his grand solution: \u2018The color green is the best color, so therefore green M&M\u2019s are the best M&M\u2019s.\u2019 A stunned silence in the crowd was quickly following by a standing ovation lasting over five minutes. Finally, as the applause died down, Dr. Mathers, red-cheeked and clutching a bottle of celebratory champagne, added: \u201cAnd now we begin our studies into why blue M&M\u2019s are definitely the next best M&M\u2019s!\u201d\r\nCheck out Claire's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/csaffitz/\r\n\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

When it comes to the powdered cheese state, all pale in comparison to Nacho Cheese Doritos, continually perfected by science and consistently beloved by the masses since 1972.

From that dough, Luca makes cavatelli, malloreddus, lorighittas, cencioni, capunti, strascinati, culurgionis, and sagne incannulate. From the egg dough, D'Onofrio makes fusilli al ferretto, tagliatelle, tortellini, farfalle, garganelli, anolini, cappelletti, tagliolini, agnolotti, sacchetti. From the spinach dough, Luca makes foglie d'ulivo, trofie, fagiolini, and pappardelle. From the cuttlefish squid ink pasta dough, D'Onofrio makes orecchiette, strichetti, fettuccine, and corzetti.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n0:00 Introduction\r\n0:51 Cavatelli\r\n1:14 Malloreddus\r\n1:46  Lorighittas\r\n2:25 Cencioni\r\n2:57 Capunti\r\n3:40 Strascinati\r\n3:57 Culurgionis\r\n6:00 Sagne Incannulate\r\n7:25 Fusilli al Ferretto\r\n8:07 Tagliatelle\r\n9:09 Tortellini\r\n10:58 Cappellacci di Zucca & Tortelli Piacentini\r\n13:13 Farfalle\r\n14:00 Garganelli\r\n14:38 Anolini\r\n15:40 Cappelletti\r\n16:33 Tagliolini\r\n17:08 Agnolotti\r\n17:59 Sacchetti\r\n19:45 Foglie d'Ulivo\r\n20:19 Trofie\r\n20:58 Fagiolini\r\n21:31 Pappardelle\r\n22:18 Maccheroni alla Chitarra\r\n24:12 Orecchiette al Nero di Seppia\r\n24:44 Strichetti\r\n25:21 Fettuccine al Nero di Seppia\r\n25:44 Corzetti\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

                    "description": "In this episode of Handcrafted (fka Beautiful Butchery), the Pastaio of Eataly Flatiron, Luca D'Onofrio, shows Bon App\u00e9tit how to turn four types of pasta dough -- egg pasta dough, spinach pasta dough, cuttlefish squid ink pasta dough, and semolina pasta dough -- into beautiful, handmade pasta shapes. \r\n\r\nSemolina pasta is a southern Italy specialty. From that dough, Luca makes cavatelli, malloreddus, lorighittas, cencioni, capunti, strascinati, culurgionis, and sagne incannulate. From the egg dough, D'Onofrio makes fusilli al ferretto, tagliatelle, tortellini, farfalle, garganelli, anolini, cappelletti, tagliolini, agnolotti, sacchetti. From the spinach dough, Luca makes foglie d'ulivo, trofie, fagiolini, and pappardelle. From the cuttlefish squid ink pasta dough, D'Onofrio makes orecchiette, strichetti, fettuccine, and corzetti.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n0:00 Introduction\r\n0:51 Cavatelli\r\n1:14 Malloreddus\r\n1:46  Lorighittas\r\n2:25 Cencioni\r\n2:57 Capunti\r\n3:40 Strascinati\r\n3:57 Culurgionis\r\n6:00 Sagne Incannulate\r\n7:25 Fusilli al Ferretto\r\n8:07 Tagliatelle\r\n9:09 Tortellini\r\n10:58 Cappellacci di Zucca & Tortelli Piacentini\r\n13:13 Farfalle\r\n14:00 Garganelli\r\n14:38 Anolini\r\n15:40 Cappelletti\r\n16:33 Tagliolini\r\n17:08 Agnolotti\r\n17:59 Sacchetti\r\n19:45 Foglie d'Ulivo\r\n20:19 Trofie\r\n20:58 Fagiolini\r\n21:31 Pappardelle\r\n22:18 Maccheroni alla Chitarra\r\n24:12 Orecchiette al Nero di Seppia\r\n24:44 Strichetti\r\n25:21 Fettuccine al Nero di Seppia\r\n25:44 Corzetti\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

Cut white and pale green parts from scallions (reserve dark green parts) and add to pot, along with garlic, chile, tamari, and 2 tsp. salt (chicken should be just submerged in pot; if not, add more water to completely cover). Heat pot over medium-high. As soon as liquid begins to boil, immediately reduce heat to medium-low and gently simmer until chicken is cooked through, 16\u201320 minutes (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a piece should register 155\u00b0; temperature will continue to rise once off heat). Transfer chicken to a plate; let cool slightly. Using a spider or slotted spoon, remove and discard solids from broth. Keep broth warm over low heat.\r\nMeanwhile, rinse rice in a fine-mesh sieve, stirring with your fingers, until liquid runs mostly clear. Shake off excess water and transfer to a medium saucepan; add a pinch of salt. Add 1\u00bc cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed, 18\u201322 minutes. Fluff with a fork; cover and let sit 10 minutes.\r\nFinely chop reserved dark green parts from scallions and set aside 1 Tbsp. for sprinkling. Toss remaining chopped scallions, rice, cucumber, ginger, pickling juice, and 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula in a large bowl until rice looks speckled; season with salt.\r\nPull chicken meat off bones; thinly slice. Divide rice and chicken among bowls and pour some hot broth over. Sprinkle each bowl with sesame seeds and reserved scallions. Reserve leftover broth for sipping.\n\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nABOUT BON APP\u00c9TIT\r\nCook with confidence using Bon Appetit\u2019s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.

In this episode of Handcrafted, Haraguchi shows Bon App\u00e9tit how to butcher a whole tuna and explains every cut of fish you would see at sushi restaurants.

He breaks down the tuna into back loin, belly loin, pelvic fins, bones, and collars.

Pile on the greens for a full sheet tray meal. Combine extra herbs with some well-seasoned quinoa and you've got a delicious side salad.
