It\u2019s very small, but the reason people come all the way here is to eat at Restaurante Mannix, a restaurant that\u2019s known to serve some of the best fire roasted lamb in Spain! Today we also have the special opportunity to visit the factory of Joselito - widely considered to be one of the best Spanish hams in the world.\n\nRestaurante Mannix (https://g.page/RestauranteMannix?share) - First lunch, and we saw a bit of the cooking process where they use locally raised lambs. The lambs are cooked in an adobe mud oven with orange fire wood. The result is that the lamb is insanely tender - they literally use a spoon to cut it up - and the skin is so crispy and juicy. Some of the best roast lamb I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Restaurante Mannix is family run, and they are so hospitable and friendly. Price - \u20ac50 per plate of lamb\n\nJoselito Jamon (https://www.joselito.com/en/home) - Next up we drove to Salamanca, Spain with Jose from Joselito. Joselito is known throughout Spain and the world for producing some of the best Spanish jamon in a natural way with no additives or preservatives. It was amazing to see the factory and the process that goes into it. The pigs are Iberico and 100% acorn fed. The taste is something truly magical.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link to Amazon.

Today we\u2019re eating at the legendary Elkano, one of the greatest seafood restaurants in Europe, and dedicated to grilled turbot.\n\nFriends in the video: \nGabriella Ranelli: https://www.tenedortours.com/\nJeffrey Merrihue: https://www.instagram.com/xtremefoodies_/\n\nElkano is a legendary seafood restaurant throughout Spain. The restaurant was originally started by Mr. Pedro, who is credited with being the first to grill an entire whole turbot. The restaurant is currently run by Mr. Aitor Arregui, the son of Pedro. They specialize in the ultra freshest and best quality seafood, prepared simply.\n\nA few of my favorite dishes of the meal were the spider crab, deshelled and mixed with the head butter; Atlantic blue lobster with its roe; and the whole grilled turbot fish. Almost everything you\u2019ll eat at Restaurant Elkano will be from the grill, with simple preparations to highlight the seafood without covering it up. Again, Elkano is yet another example of Spanish food - taking the best quality ingredients and simply preparing them.\n\nAll the food was delicious, but without a doubt the highlight was the whole grilled turbot - the fish that no one leaves without trying.

Today we\u2019re eating at the legendary Elkano, one of the greatest seafood restaurants in Europe, and dedicated to grilled turbot.\n\nFriends in the video: \nGabriella Ranelli: https://www.tenedortours.com/\nJeffrey Merrihue: https://www.instagram.com/xtremefoodies_/\n\nElkano is a legendary seafood restaurant throughout Spain. The restaurant was originally started by Mr. Pedro, who is credited with being the first to grill an entire whole turbot. The restaurant is currently run by Mr. Aitor Arregui, the son of Pedro. They specialize in the ultra freshest and best quality seafood, prepared simply.\n\nA few of my favorite dishes of the meal were the spider crab, deshelled and mixed with the head butter; Atlantic blue lobster with its roe; and the whole grilled turbot fish. Almost everything you\u2019ll eat at Restaurant Elkano will be from the grill, with simple preparations to highlight the seafood without covering it up. Again, Elkano is yet another example of Spanish food - taking the best quality ingredients and simply preparing them.\n\nAll the food was delicious, but without a doubt the highlight was the whole grilled turbot - the fish that no one leaves without trying. Mr. Aitor brought it to our table and parts it out into each individual piece that has a different flavor and texture. He then proceeds to make a pil pil sauce on the fish plate from the fatty protein of the fish. It\u2019s truly incredible.

In this video I\u2019m going to give you a full tour of our tea resort hotel room!\n\nSmall room - 2,900 THB ($86.94) per night\nBig room - 4,700 THB ($140.89) per night\nI thought rates were a bit on the expensive side. But that's probably because we went during high season in the winter.\n\nWe also had a breakfast that that was served buffet style and included scrambled eggs with tea leaves - that was a first for me!\n\n\ud83d\udccd Lee Wine Rak Resort (\u0e25\u0e35\u0e44\u0e27\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e17): https://goo.gl/maps/mDEJTnH64gzha1wM6\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

We got a great deal and stayed for 4 nights. The hotel is fantastic, staff were so friendly and helpful, the pool villa was relaxing, and the grounds of the hotel - right along the beach - are beautiful.\n\nWhen you go to Phuket, one of the things you always have to keep in mind is how big the island is. It\u2019s 50 km in length and can take 1 - 1.5 hours to drive from the north to the south. This hotel, Anantara Mai Khao Phuket villas is located along Mai Khao Beach, which is one of the most quiet and relaxing areas of Phuket at the very northern end of the island. Come here if you want peace and quiet and want to be away from action and too many other people. But keep in mind it\u2019s about 45 minutes to Phuket town.\n\nWe really enjoyed our stay, and again it\u2019s a perfect place for families or if you want to be in a quiet and relaxing place. We got a really good deal on our stay at right about $130 per night. But usually for this pool villa it would probably cost more.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

We got a great deal and stayed for 4 nights. The hotel is fantastic, staff were so friendly and helpful, the pool villa was relaxing, and the grounds of the hotel - right along the beach - are beautiful.\n\nWhen you go to Phuket, one of the things you always have to keep in mind is how big the island is. It\u2019s 50 km in length and can take 1 - 1.5 hours to drive from the north to the south. This hotel, Anantara Mai Khao Phuket villas is located along Mai Khao Beach, which is one of the most quiet and relaxing areas of Phuket at the very northern end of the island. Come here if you want peace and quiet and want to be away from action and too many other people. But keep in mind it\u2019s about 45 minutes to Phuket town.\n\nWe really enjoyed our stay, and again it\u2019s a perfect place for families or if you want to be in a quiet and relaxing place. We got a really good deal on our stay at right about $130 per night. But usually for this pool villa it would probably cost more.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

On this trip we visited Bo Kluea (\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d), which is a small village in the mountains known for its natural salt wells where they have harvested salt for over centuries. It\u2019s amazing place to visit and learn about the history and the trade of salt in the area. In this video though, I\u2019m give you a tour of the hotel we stayed at, probably the best hotel in the village, and we\u2019re going to eat their famous fried chicken!\n\nBoklua View Hotel (\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27 \u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e17 https://goo.gl/maps/yd36MissjkVKiURx7) - It\u2019s a great hotel / mountain lodge, right within the village and the mountains. From the lodge, it\u2019s just about a 5 minute walk to the salt wells and the main walking street of the village. When you\u2019re at the hotel, there are plenty of gardens and areas to explore and walk around. You also have a selection of different types of rooms and bungalows available. Our was all the way at the back and the top of the property.\n\nFor dinner we went to the lodge restaurant, which is very popular among Thais, both on day trips and almost everyone who stays at the lodge eats there for dinner. So you must make a booking for dinner. Along with the roasted pumpkin, one of their signature dishes is the mahkwen fried chicken, a spice that\u2019s similar to Sichuan pepper. The fried chicken was delicious, very Chinese chili fried chicken style, dry fried, without a batter. They used a local free range chicken, so it had some delicious texture too. Amazing dish, must eat when you\u2019re in Bo Kluea (\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d).\n\nWe had a great stay at Boklua View Hotel (\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27 \u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e17).

On this trip we visited Bo Kluea (\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d), which is a small village in the mountains known for its natural salt wells where they have harvested salt for over centuries. It\u2019s amazing place to visit and learn about the history and the trade of salt in the area. In this video though, I\u2019m give you a tour of the hotel we stayed at, probably the best hotel in the village, and we\u2019re going to eat their famous fried chicken!\n\nBoklua View Hotel (\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27 \u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e17 https://goo.gl/maps/yd36MissjkVKiURx7) - It\u2019s a great hotel / mountain lodge, right within the village and the mountains. From the lodge, it\u2019s just about a 5 minute walk to the salt wells and the main walking street of the village. When you\u2019re at the hotel, there are plenty of gardens and areas to explore and walk around. You also have a selection of different types of rooms and bungalows available. Our was all the way at the back and the top of the property.\n\nFor dinner we went to the lodge restaurant, which is very popular among Thais, both on day trips and almost everyone who stays at the lodge eats there for dinner. So you must make a booking for dinner. Along with the roasted pumpkin, one of their signature dishes is the mahkwen fried chicken, a spice that\u2019s similar to Sichuan pepper. The fried chicken was delicious, very Chinese chili fried chicken style, dry fried, without a batter. They used a local free range chicken, so it had some delicious texture too. Amazing dish, must eat when you\u2019re in Bo Kluea (\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d).\n\nWe had a great stay at Boklua View Hotel (\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27 \u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e17). I think the best thing about it is the natural setting, and the special fried chicken.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

First have a look at the actual wells that produce salty water. Then you can navigate your way to one of the huts where they still boil the water over wood, to evaporate the water and leaf huge mineral salt crystals. Since times have changed, and people are no longer trading salt, the community has shifted to tourism - especially Thai local tourism, and they make a series of salt products that you can buy to support them.\n\nKhao soi - 30 THB ($0.95) - We were getting hungry, so for lunch we had a delicious bowl of khao soi, Thai curry noodles. The restaurant is just past the first salt wells. Curry noodles were delicious and Aunty was friendly.\n\nHighly recommended to visit Bo Kluea (\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d) when you visit Nan, Thailand!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Krabi is known for its amazing islands, and you can take a day trip just off the coast of Ao Nang to see some of the spectacular islands, and go snorkeling, and swimming. Today we\u2019re going on a family long-tail boat trip and I\u2019ll share the details and tips with you. #Krabi #Thailand #beach\n\nWe took a relatively short day trip, there are other islands you can visit, but we mainly went to a few of the close islands - really good for a family day trip, or if you have kids.\n\nThale Waek - First beach we went to, and there is a 400 THB ($12.68) entrance fee as it\u2019s a Thailand national park. The beach is very nice and quite unique with its sand bars. But I liked the snorkeling even better around the side of the island.\n\nChicken Rock - One of the famous small islands off the coast of Krabi is Koh Gai, or chicken rock island. Mostly you just sail past it and get a nice view.\n\nKoh Poda - Finally, on this island hopping tour in Krabi, we went to Koh Poda, a wonderful island with great beaches. This is where we had lunch and it\u2019s a popular place to hang out, relax, and swim.\n\nTotal Price - 2,000 THB ($63.41) for the entire boat, and if you can get a few more people to join, it would be more affordable.

Krabi is known for its amazing islands, and you can take a day trip just off the coast of Ao Nang to see some of the spectacular islands, and go snorkeling, and swimming. Today we\u2019re going on a family long-tail boat trip and I\u2019ll share the details and tips with you. #Krabi #Thailand #beach\n\nWe took a relatively short day trip, there are other islands you can visit, but we mainly went to a few of the close islands - really good for a family day trip, or if you have kids.\n\nThale Waek - First beach we went to, and there is a 400 THB ($12.68) entrance fee as it\u2019s a Thailand national park. The beach is very nice and quite unique with its sand bars. But I liked the snorkeling even better around the side of the island.\n\nChicken Rock - One of the famous small islands off the coast of Krabi is Koh Gai, or chicken rock island. Mostly you just sail past it and get a nice view.\n\nKoh Poda - Finally, on this island hopping tour in Krabi, we went to Koh Poda, a wonderful island with great beaches. This is where we had lunch and it\u2019s a popular place to hang out, relax, and swim.\n\nTotal Price - 2,000 THB ($63.41) for the entire boat, and if you can get a few more people to join, it would be more affordable.

From the top, it was even colder because of the wind whipping across the top of the hill. After arriving to the rest hut, we unloaded our gear and breakfast, and started drinking some coffee, to wait for the sunrise.\n\nBreakfast included Thai grilled pork and sticky rice, muffins, local oranges, yoghurt, granola, coffee and tea. It was fantastic.\n\nPart of what made our family sunrise breakfast so special was also just that it\u2019s not a tourist location, so it\u2019s completely quiet, peaceful, nature, and the beauty is spectacular.\n\n\ud83d\udccd Lanjia Lodge: https://www.asian-oasis.com/lanjia/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

I was excited to stay here for many reasons - the natural beauty of the mountains and views, the natural feel of everything, and how when you stay here, you\u2019re directly supporting the community. So in this video, I\u2019ll be giving you a full tour of our cottage, so you can know what to expect when you stay at Lanjia Lodge! #ChiangRai #Thailand #LanjiaLodge\n\nFirst of all, one of the greatest things about Lanjia Lodge is that it\u2019s integrated into the community. There are both Hmong and Lahu people within the village, and staying at Lanjia Lodge is an opportunity to learn about both of these peoples. In fact, a stay includes a walking tour of the village, plus a visit to the traditional shaman of the village.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s an all inclusive stay, so the price includes accommodation, dinner and breakfast, cultural musical performance at night, and a walking tour.\n\nPrice - We paid about 5,000 THB ($163.34) per night for 3 of us, and again it\u2019s all inclusive, while directly supporting the community in an ethical way.\n\nIn addition to learning about the Hmong and Lahu, Lanjia Lodge is just one of the most relaxing, chilled out places. We loved our stay, and great for family and kids.\n\n\ud83d\udccd Lanjia Lodge: https://www.asian-oasis.com/lanjia/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

I was excited to stay here for many reasons - the natural beauty of the mountains and views, the natural feel of everything, and how when you stay here, you\u2019re directly supporting the community. So in this video, I\u2019ll be giving you a full tour of our cottage, so you can know what to expect when you stay at Lanjia Lodge! #ChiangRai #Thailand #LanjiaLodge\n\nFirst of all, one of the greatest things about Lanjia Lodge is that it\u2019s integrated into the community. There are both Hmong and Lahu people within the village, and staying at Lanjia Lodge is an opportunity to learn about both of these peoples. In fact, a stay includes a walking tour of the village, plus a visit to the traditional shaman of the village.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s an all inclusive stay, so the price includes accommodation, dinner and breakfast, cultural musical performance at night, and a walking tour.\n\nPrice - We paid about 5,000 THB ($163.34) per night for 3 of us, and again it\u2019s all inclusive, while directly supporting the community in an ethical way.\n\nIn addition to learning about the Hmong and Lahu, Lanjia Lodge is just one of the most relaxing, chilled out places. We loved our stay, and great for family and kids.\n\n\ud83d\udccd Lanjia Lodge: https://www.asian-oasis.com/lanjia/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

People are cool, food is delicious, and there\u2019s some spectacular off the beaten path things to do. Part of the reason why Phatthalung is a lesser visited province in Southern Thailand is because they don\u2019t have an ocean coastline like most other Southern Thai provinces.

Hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

It\u2019s a place you can visit for relaxation, Isaan culture, and especially adventure and nature. One of the places I was most looking forward to visiting in Bueng Kan (\u0e1a\u0e36\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e2c) is a temple that\u2019s built on and surrounding red mountain rock, called Wat Jetiyakhiri (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e40\u0e08\u0e15\u0e34\u0e22\u0e32\u0e04\u0e34\u0e23\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23) or better known as Wat Phu Tok (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e20\u0e39\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e01) Temple - lonely mountain temple. #BuengKan #Thailand #WatPhuTok\n\nThe temple was originally founded by Ajahn Juan who loved the mountain for its dangerous wildlife such as tigers and snakes. Eventually monks build a series of shrines, and ladders, and wooden plank walkways around the rock outcrop, with seven layers. The 6th layer is the most thrilling and adventurous - there\u2019s an entire circumference of wooden planks around the rock that are hand build and anchored into the rock. You\u2019re around 300 meters high with nothing below you and just a wooden plank between you and falling all the way down. The 7th level just includes nature and views from the top.\n\nWat Phu Tok (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e20\u0e39\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e01) is without a doubt one of the most adventurous, slightly dangerous, and scary temples I\u2019ve visited in Thailand and also one of the most beautiful and thrilling.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

It\u2019s a place you can visit for relaxation, Isaan culture, and especially adventure and nature. One of the places I was most looking forward to visiting in Bueng Kan (\u0e1a\u0e36\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e2c) is a temple that\u2019s built on and surrounding red mountain rock, called Wat Jetiyakhiri (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e40\u0e08\u0e15\u0e34\u0e22\u0e32\u0e04\u0e34\u0e23\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23) or better known as Wat Phu Tok (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e20\u0e39\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e01) Temple - lonely mountain temple. #BuengKan #Thailand #WatPhuTok\n\nThe temple was originally founded by Ajahn Juan who loved the mountain for its dangerous wildlife such as tigers and snakes. Eventually monks build a series of shrines, and ladders, and wooden plank walkways around the rock outcrop, with seven layers. The 6th layer is the most thrilling and adventurous - there\u2019s an entire circumference of wooden planks around the rock that are hand build and anchored into the rock. You\u2019re around 300 meters high with nothing below you and just a wooden plank between you and falling all the way down. The 7th level just includes nature and views from the top.\n\nWat Phu Tok (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e20\u0e39\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e01) is without a doubt one of the most adventurous, slightly dangerous, and scary temples I\u2019ve visited in Thailand and also one of the most beautiful and thrilling.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Along with spectacular islands, delicious food, and amazingly friendly people, Satun is home to a number of spectacular waterfalls. About an hour drive from Satun city is Wang Sai Thong Waterfall (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e15\u0e01\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07), a waterfall I had on my list to visit - so I was excited to finally have a chance to visit. #Satun #travelvlog #waterfall\n\nWang Sai Thong Waterfall (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e15\u0e01\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07) - Price - 200 THB ($6.60) entrance (just 20 THB for Thai citizens). Just a 100 meter walk from the parking lot and you\u2019ll reach the beautiful waterfalls. The waterfall is not a huge drop waterfall, but it\u2019s rather a series of cascading waterfalls and baths of water that have naturally formed. It really is a natural waterfall playground and bath tub. An amazing place to hike around, swim, and splash in the water. I really enjoyed it.\n\nRestoran Negara - Next we drove back to Satun city, about an hour drive and went to Restoran Negara, a central restaurant and tea shop right in the heart of the city. It was Friday, so quite a few restaurants were closed in the city so we just stopped here because it was open. We ordered a number of dishes, and overall the food was alright. The roti and the teh tarik were a little sweet, but very good.

Along with spectacular islands, delicious food, and amazingly friendly people, Satun is home to a number of spectacular waterfalls. About an hour drive from Satun city is Wang Sai Thong Waterfall (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e15\u0e01\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07), a waterfall I had on my list to visit - so I was excited to finally have a chance to visit. #Satun #travelvlog #waterfall\n\nWang Sai Thong Waterfall (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e15\u0e01\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07) - Price - 200 THB ($6.60) entrance (just 20 THB for Thai citizens). Just a 100 meter walk from the parking lot and you\u2019ll reach the beautiful waterfalls. The waterfall is not a huge drop waterfall, but it\u2019s rather a series of cascading waterfalls and baths of water that have naturally formed. It really is a natural waterfall playground and bath tub. An amazing place to hike around, swim, and splash in the water. I really enjoyed it.\n\nRestoran Negara - Next we drove back to Satun city, about an hour drive and went to Restoran Negara, a central restaurant and tea shop right in the heart of the city. It was Friday, so quite a few restaurants were closed in the city so we just stopped here because it was open. We ordered a number of dishes, and overall the food was alright. The roti and the teh tarik were a little sweet, but very good. Total price - 640 THB ($21.12)\n\nAnd that wraps up day one in Satun, and I would highly recommend Wang Sai Thong Waterfall (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e15\u0e01\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07) as one of the top things to do when you\u2019re in Satun!\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Quite a name for an outstandingly amazing place. And without a doubt, you are guaranteed to be surrounded by nature - within nature - and always with the sound of the river flowing in your ears.

But I\u2019ll give you a full tour in this video, and also of the more kid friendly room where we stayed - which was still a treet house.

To take a boat you\u2019ll need to get to Ratchaprapha Marina (\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e19). For our private boat it cost 2,500 THB ($80) and additionally there\u2019s a Thai national park entrance fee of 320 THB ($10.24).\n\nCheow Lan Lake (\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e19) is incredibly beautiful, stunning water and mountain formations. I would highly recommend visiting when you are at Khao Sok National Park in Surat Thani, Thailand.\n\nNOTE: You take the boat from Ratchaprapha Marina (\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e19 https://goo.gl/maps/mccMRUEyAEU122D76) which is about an hour drive from Khao Sok National Park (even though it\u2019s part of Khao Sok National Park).\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

It was built with Middle East and European styles in the 16th century.\n\nYaring City - On the way to the cape we stopped for some Malay street food sweets in Yaring City.\n\nLaem Tachi (Tachi Cape) - One of the highlights of today was driving all the way to the tip of Laem Tachi (Tachi Cape) for sun set, spectacular.\n\nPattani Central Mosque - Finally, to end this tour of Pattani on Day 1, we stopped at the amazing Pattani Central Mosque at night.\n\nAgain, the people, the Malay culture, street food snacks were wonderful and it was an honor to have a chance to visit Pattani, South Thailand.\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

I was excited to explore and I was blown away by the kindness of people, historical attractions, the delicious street food snacks, and the amazing natural beauty. \n\nHere are the things we did in this Pattani travel guide video:\n\nPattani salt - first we visited a community that produces Pattani salt, known throughout Thailand as one of the best sea salts.\n\nKrue Se Mosque - Welcome to the oldest mosque in Thailand, known for its brick construction and arches. It was built with Middle East and European styles in the 16th century.\n\nYaring City - On the way to the cape we stopped for some Malay street food sweets in Yaring City.\n\nLaem Tachi (Tachi Cape) - One of the highlights of today was driving all the way to the tip of Laem Tachi (Tachi Cape) for sun set, spectacular.\n\nPattani Central Mosque - Finally, to end this tour of Pattani on Day 1, we stopped at the amazing Pattani Central Mosque at night.\n\nAgain, the people, the Malay culture, street food snacks were wonderful and it was an honor to have a chance to visit Pattani, South Thailand.\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

On this trip to Chiang Mai, we were still craving the delicious food, and so we went there again this time for lunch.\n\nThe menu is a full checklist including a couple dozen Northern Thai dishes that you can choose from.\n\nHere\u2019s what we ordered:\n\nGai neung (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23)\nGaeng hanglay (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e2e\u0e31\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25)\nKhua ho (\u0e04\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e42\u0e2e\u0e4a\u0e30)\nNam prik noom (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e19\u0e48\u0e38\u0e21)\nSaa pak gad noi (\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e01\u0e32\u0e14\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22)\nGaeng khae (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e41\u0e04)\nTam khanun (\u0e15\u0e33\u0e02\u0e19\u0e38\u0e19)\n\nTotal price - 670 THB ($21.35)\n\nWhile you can\u2019t go wrong and just about everything you order will be delicious, I\u2019m particularly in love with their Gai neung (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23), chicken in a huge amount of herbs and fresh spices, then steamed.

It\u2019s about a 15 minute drive from the center of the city.\n\nThank you for watching, hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

One day, along with my friend Joel, we decided to take a drive to Mon Jam, enjoy some amazing scenery, fresh air, and delicious local Hmong Food from the mountains. #Thailand #travel #Hmong\n\nWe started off, and first enjoyed the amazing views and viewpoints once we arrived. Then we headed to the market to walk around. First we bought some fruit - they have a great selection of less tropical, and more fruits that need elevation and cooler weather to grow - like melons, citrus, and egg fruit.

The hotel is located a couple kilometers from the entrance of the official historical park, but there\u2019s even some ruins right next to the hotel. The Siamese Kingdom stretched far over a large area, and so there are some ancient temples and stupas right next to the hotel. I loved the setting, the local Sukhothai Thai architecture, and the views of the palmyra palm trees and rice paddy fields from the rooms and the swimming pool.\n\nWithout a doubt, one of the highlights of your stay at Sriwilai Sukhothai Resort & Spa in Sukhothai will be the swimming pool, which is huge, and overlooks the fields and some ruins. An incredibly nice setting and atmosphere!\n\nFinally, to end this hotel tour, we went to breakfast in the morning. Breakfast was good, but simple. I did really like the display, served on a traditional khantoke style basket to eat from. I'm not sure if they would normally have had a buffet - but we stayed after the lockdown, so there were some different safety measured in place.\n\nOverall, we had an amazing stay at the hotel, loved the room, the swimming pool, and the spectacular atmosphere. Highly recommended.\n\nPrice - We paid 2,500 THB ($80.88) per night, including breakfast - This was a bit of a special deal though I believe because the hotel had recently re-opened after the lockdown. I think this was a very good value.\n\nThank you for watching and hope you can visit Sukhothai (\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22)!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Had a quick swim and then headed out for dinner. #Thailand #Sukhothai\n\nThere was a restaurant we were trying to go to eat at in the center of Sukhothai new city, but they were closed, so we headed back to the old city and went to a restaurant called Sureerat Restaurant (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e42\u0e20\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e32). Turned out to be a great restaurant, in an old wooden house, situated right across the street from the market, and within the old city of Sukhothai.\n\nHere are the dishes we tried:\n\nJungle curry beef (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d)\nMixed vegetables (\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e23\u0e27\u0e21)\nFried egg salad (\u0e22\u0e33\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27)\nFried fish (\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e17\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e34\u0e21\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14)\n\nTotal price - 450 THB ($14.54)\n\nSureerat Restaurant (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e42\u0e20\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e32): https://goo.gl/maps/RhJyv3UqRqz7gP6y5\n\nI loved my first impression of Sukhothai, laid back and charming.

Turned out to be a great restaurant, in an old wooden house, situated right across the street from the market, and within the old city of Sukhothai.\n\nHere are the dishes we tried:\n\nJungle curry beef (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d)\nMixed vegetables (\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e23\u0e27\u0e21)\nFried egg salad (\u0e22\u0e33\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27)\nFried fish (\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e17\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e34\u0e21\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14)\n\nTotal price - 450 THB ($14.54)\n\nSureerat Restaurant (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e42\u0e20\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e32): https://goo.gl/maps/RhJyv3UqRqz7gP6y5\n\nI loved my first impression of Sukhothai, laid back and charming. In later videos, you\u2019ll get a full hotel tour, and a main street food and Sukhothai attractions tour on my main channel.\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Here\u2019s a full review of the lodge and the surrounding area. #Thailand #KhaoSok #ecolodge #hotel\n\nAnurak Community Lodge - I love the located and the area, surrounded by jagged mountains and within a grove of palm oil trees. All the rooms are named after Thai fruits, and each room is built on stilts above ground to protest from the elements and animals - probably! Rooms are basic, but very clean, and eco friendly. The bathroom is open air on the side of the room so you can hear the jungle. However, the room has AC.\n\nBreakfast was ok, not fantastic, but the coffee was pleasantly great from Chiang Mai. The staff were fantastic, very helpful and friendly. They can also help to arrange any activities you may want to do in Khao Sok National Park.\n\nPrice - We paid $50 per night. We had a great say at Anurak Community Lodge and would recommend it!\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Here\u2019s a full review of the lodge and the surrounding area. #Thailand #KhaoSok #ecolodge #hotel\n\nAnurak Community Lodge - I love the located and the area, surrounded by jagged mountains and within a grove of palm oil trees. All the rooms are named after Thai fruits, and each room is built on stilts above ground to protest from the elements and animals - probably! Rooms are basic, but very clean, and eco friendly. The bathroom is open air on the side of the room so you can hear the jungle. However, the room has AC.\n\nBreakfast was ok, not fantastic, but the coffee was pleasantly great from Chiang Mai. The staff were fantastic, very helpful and friendly. They can also help to arrange any activities you may want to do in Khao Sok National Park.\n\nPrice - We paid $50 per night. We had a great say at Anurak Community Lodge and would recommend it!\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

We decided to go to Koh Surin (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c), a national park island, known to be one of the most pristine islands in Thailand. And since it wasn\u2019t as busy with tourism as it typically is, we were able to get a booking at the National Park lodge on the island. In this video I\u2019ll share this entire experience of getting to Koh Surin, and staying in the bungalows.\n\nGreenview Tour Speedboat -  1,700 THB ($52.44) per person, roundtrip - First you must get to Koh Surin (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c) island, and the fastest way to get there is by speed boat which takes about 1 hour 10 minutes. The boat left from Khura Buri (\u0e04\u0e38\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35) pier, in Phang Nga province. The boat ride was surprisingly smooth and we arrived to the island, to the amazingly pure and clear waters of the islands.\n\nBuffet lunch - 750 THB ($23.13) per person - There aren\u2019t too many food options - or let me say, no food options other than the National Park headquarters canteen. But you can choose to order from the menu, or you can eat the buffet that lots of snorkeling trips eat on day trip to the island. Since the buffet was ready and we were really hungry, we just ate the buffet. It\u2019s not the greatest Thai food you\u2019ll eat, but it was ok.\n\nBungalow Price - 2,000 THB ($61.69) per night - Bungalows are basic, but comfortable, with AC and self contained. I thought they were great.\n\nThe best things for me about staying at the bungalow overnight is that Koh Surin (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c) can be busy during the day because most people take day trips to the island, but head back to mainly by 3 or 4 pm. So being there after hours, it was so quiet, so peaceful, and so relaxing. That was the best.\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

We decided to go to Koh Surin (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c), a national park island, known to be one of the most pristine islands in Thailand. And since it wasn\u2019t as busy with tourism as it typically is, we were able to get a booking at the National Park lodge on the island. In this video I\u2019ll share this entire experience of getting to Koh Surin, and staying in the bungalows.\n\nGreenview Tour Speedboat -  1,700 THB ($52.44) per person, roundtrip - First you must get to Koh Surin (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c) island, and the fastest way to get there is by speed boat which takes about 1 hour 10 minutes. The boat left from Khura Buri (\u0e04\u0e38\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35) pier, in Phang Nga province. The boat ride was surprisingly smooth and we arrived to the island, to the amazingly pure and clear waters of the islands.\n\nBuffet lunch - 750 THB ($23.13) per person - There aren\u2019t too many food options - or let me say, no food options other than the National Park headquarters canteen. But you can choose to order from the menu, or you can eat the buffet that lots of snorkeling trips eat on day trip to the island. Since the buffet was ready and we were really hungry, we just ate the buffet. It\u2019s not the greatest Thai food you\u2019ll eat, but it was ok.\n\nBungalow Price - 2,000 THB ($61.69) per night - Bungalows are basic, but comfortable, with AC and self contained. I thought they were great.\n\nThe best things for me about staying at the bungalow overnight is that Koh Surin (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c) can be busy during the day because most people take day trips to the island, but head back to mainly by 3 or 4 pm. So being there after hours, it was so quiet, so peaceful, and so relaxing. That was the best.\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

So my wife, son, and I wanted to get away from Bangkok for a day. We drove just south of Bangkok about 1.5 hours to Pattaya, a famous seaside city in Thailand. Just south of Pattaya, but still considered part of Pattaya is Bang Saray (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e48), much more quiet and relaxed than the center of Pattaya. #Pattaya #Thailand #hotel\n \nBang Saray Seafood (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23 \u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e48 \u0e0b\u0e35\u0e1f\u0e39\u0e49\u0e14) - But first things - before checking into the hotel, we stopped for some Thai food at Bang Saray Seafood (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23 \u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e48 \u0e0b\u0e35\u0e1f\u0e39\u0e49\u0e14).

Turned out to be a great small boutique hotel, right along the water. Staff were friendly and helpful, there were plenty of social distancing and hygiene measures in place. And she booked the room with a private swimming pool overlooking the hotel. It was quite a cool room, and we had a lot of fun splashing around in the water. Breakfast in the morning was also great, a buffet with vegetables, and a full array of pre-cooked Thai food in the morning. One things to note about this hotel in Pattaya is that it\u2019s on the sea, but it\u2019s not really a swimming beach. Price - 7,300 THB ($231.51) per night, for the room we had. There are other room options as well.\n \nIt was a great short trip, and nice to get out of Bangkok with hotels re-opening and tourism opening back up domestically in Thailand.\n \nHope you\u2019re doing well and keeping safe!\n \n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

One things to note about this hotel in Pattaya is that it\u2019s on the sea, but it\u2019s not really a swimming beach. Price - 7,300 THB ($231.51) per night, for the room we had. There are other room options as well.\n \nIt was a great short trip, and nice to get out of Bangkok with hotels re-opening and tourism opening back up domestically in Thailand.\n \nHope you\u2019re doing well and keeping safe!\n \n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

And then there\u2019s plenty of Chinese restaurants everywhere you look.\n\nHehe Chinese Restaurant - We headed straight to Hehe Chinese restaurant, a well established Chinese food restaurant in Budapest. They had a takeaway food counter with prepared food - just like in China - and they had a full menu. Their bowls of noodles looked really good. But we ordered from the menu, mapo tofu, cabbage with pork, hot and sour soup, and a Sichuan style fried chicken with chilies. The food was delicious, even better than I had imagined or thought it would be. The taste of the food was just like being in China. The total price for our meal came to 9,100 HUF ($27.75 USD).\n\nIt was great to visit Chinatown in Budapest, Hungary, and especially to have Chinese food.

Along the way, we stopped to eat some amazing Jamaican food along the way - a Jamaican food road trip. #Jamaica #JamaicanFood #OchoRios\n\nPuddin Man - One of the places we wanted to stop is Pudding Man - they make a type of cake using a fire and charcoal. We got the classic pumpkin. It was great, rich and sweet. Price - 200 JMD ($1.45)\n\nOcho Rios - In Ocho Rios, we stopped for lunch, and this time at Soldiers Restaurant for a classic Jamaican box lunch where you choose the dishes you want, and they are all filled into a box to good. Food was home-cooked and delicious! Price - About 700 JMD ($5.07)\n\nG & B Jerk Centre - Finally, another stop on this Jamaica road trip was at G & B Jerk Centre that a couple friends had recommended. It was amazing, so good. To be honest we tried some of the jerk at Boston Bay as well, but this I thought was better and fresher. Price - 500 JMD ($3.62) per \u00bc lb.\n\nPort Antonio - After about 5 hours and many Jamaican food stops along the way, we arrived to Port Antonio. We actually continued on past Port Antonio to spend the night.\n\nIt was another great day in Jamaica and a wonderful road trip!\n\nFriends in the video:\nJoel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian and Banana Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Along the way, we stopped to eat some amazing Jamaican food along the way - a Jamaican food road trip. #Jamaica #JamaicanFood #OchoRios\n\nPuddin Man - One of the places we wanted to stop is Pudding Man - they make a type of cake using a fire and charcoal. We got the classic pumpkin. It was great, rich and sweet. Price - 200 JMD ($1.45)\n\nOcho Rios - In Ocho Rios, we stopped for lunch, and this time at Soldiers Restaurant for a classic Jamaican box lunch where you choose the dishes you want, and they are all filled into a box to good. Food was home-cooked and delicious! Price - About 700 JMD ($5.07)\n\nG & B Jerk Centre - Finally, another stop on this Jamaica road trip was at G & B Jerk Centre that a couple friends had recommended. It was amazing, so good. To be honest we tried some of the jerk at Boston Bay as well, but this I thought was better and fresher. Price - 500 JMD ($3.62) per \u00bc lb.\n\nPort Antonio - After about 5 hours and many Jamaican food stops along the way, we arrived to Port Antonio. We actually continued on past Port Antonio to spend the night.\n\nIt was another great day in Jamaica and a wonderful road trip!\n\nFriends in the video:\nJoel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian and Banana Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

It really is the countryside. But their legendary Lamb\u2019s River roast suckling pig, stuffed with jerk rice, is what has put this small village on the map. #Jamaica #JamaicanFood #Caribbean\n\nAlong with Matt (https://www.instagram.com/jamaicafoodboss/), one Saturday afternoon, we decided to drive to Lamb\u2019s River for a taste of this amazing Jamaican food.\n\nThey only serve it on Saturdays, and you have to be there right on time, or you\u2019ll miss out - they sell out quickly. Most regulars are there as they arrive. The amazing family has been roasting suckling pigs like this for generations, and they continue to cook and serve in the same manner. The pig is unloaded, and immediately you start order and they dish it out. You order by the pound - a foil wrapper of fresh home-style roast suckling pig, with extremely crispy skin, with a scoop of jerk rice which is cooked inside the pig.\n\nYou can taste the fruitiness of the scotch bonnet peppers and the sweetness of the allspice berries, paired with the meaty deliciousness of the roast pig. And that skin!\n\nFriends in the video:\nMatt Robinson: https://www.instagram.com/jamaicafoodboss/\nJoel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

It really is the countryside. But their legendary Lamb\u2019s River roast suckling pig, stuffed with jerk rice, is what has put this small village on the map. #Jamaica #JamaicanFood #Caribbean\n\nAlong with Matt (https://www.instagram.com/jamaicafoodboss/), one Saturday afternoon, we decided to drive to Lamb\u2019s River for a taste of this amazing Jamaican food.\n\nThey only serve it on Saturdays, and you have to be there right on time, or you\u2019ll miss out - they sell out quickly. Most regulars are there as they arrive. The amazing family has been roasting suckling pigs like this for generations, and they continue to cook and serve in the same manner. The pig is unloaded, and immediately you start order and they dish it out. You order by the pound - a foil wrapper of fresh home-style roast suckling pig, with extremely crispy skin, with a scoop of jerk rice which is cooked inside the pig.\n\nYou can taste the fruitiness of the scotch bonnet peppers and the sweetness of the allspice berries, paired with the meaty deliciousness of the roast pig. And that skin!\n\nFriends in the video:\nMatt Robinson: https://www.instagram.com/jamaicafoodboss/\nJoel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Truly a must visit destinations when you are visiting Iran.\n\nMohamad Restaurant - After visiting Persepolis, we then headed to Mohamad Restaurant, what is an Iranian food restaurant especially popular among truck drivers. It was my kind of place, laid back ambiance, chilled out space, and delicious local food.\n\nHere are the main dishes we ordered:\n\nGheimeh - split pea stew\nAkbar Joojeh - fried chicken, pomegranate sauce\nSalad Shirazi - Persian cucumber salad\nKalam Polo - Cabbage rice\n\nAnother great day, amazing people, and delicious food in Iran!\n\nThank you to Ghasr Setareh (https://www.instagram.com/ghasr_setareh/) for arranging our trip to Iran.\n\nFriends in the video:\nMr. Taster: https://www.instagram.com/mr.taster/\nPersia Tour Guide: https://www.instagram.com/persiatourguide/\nRambod: https://www.instagram.com/rambod_rastegar/\nAli: https://www.instagram.com/alimojarad/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Iranian breakfast included bread, Iranian omelet of eggs and tomato paste and tea.\n\nWe had an amazing time visit Masuleh village in Iran, and thank you to everyone who made our visit to Iran possible.\n\nThank you to Ghasr Setareh (https://www.instagram.com/ghasr_setareh/) for arranging our trip to Iran.\n\nFriends in the video:\nMr. Taster: https://www.instagram.com/mr.taster/\nPersia Tour Guide: https://www.instagram.com/persiatourguide/\nRambod: https://www.instagram.com/rambod_rastegar/\nAli: https://www.instagram.com/alimojarad/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Staff were incredibly helpful and things all went smoothly. The room was spectacular, with a view of the snowy mountains of Tehran, and a unique orange colored mirror glass wall leading to the bathroom.\n\nIranian Breakfast - But the real part of Espinas Palace Hotel that blew me away was the breakfast buffet, including both Iranian and Western food. The main thing I loved the most was the omelet - both the Iranian omelet and the Western omelet. Both were unique and both were cooked to perfection. Don\u2019t miss the omelet when you\u2019re staying here.\n\nThank you to Espinas Palace Hotel for hosting my family and I in Tehran, Iran \ud83d\ude4f.

It\u2019s a 5 Star hotel, and one of the best hotels in Tehran! #Tehran #Iran #IranianFood\n\nDirectly from the airport, we drove straight to the hotel, where the hospitality already shined. Staff were incredibly helpful and things all went smoothly. The room was spectacular, with a view of the snowy mountains of Tehran, and a unique orange colored mirror glass wall leading to the bathroom.\n\nIranian Breakfast - But the real part of Espinas Palace Hotel that blew me away was the breakfast buffet, including both Iranian and Western food. The main thing I loved the most was the omelet - both the Iranian omelet and the Western omelet. Both were unique and both were cooked to perfection. Don\u2019t miss the omelet when you\u2019re staying here.\n\nThank you to Espinas Palace Hotel for hosting my family and I in Tehran, Iran \ud83d\ude4f. I didn\u2019t pay for my stay, but I chose to make this video.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but are always one of my favorite places to explore. #Russia #RussianFood #SaintPetersburg\n\nMix of cultures, flavors, ingredients, and foods - Something I was happily surprised about was the mix of cultures represented at the market in Saint Petersburg - there were a mix of people mainly from former Soviet countries like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan and the food represented that. After walking around the market for a little while, we then stopped to eat some Russian pickles from a friendly lady. Her pickles were delicious. Next I tried a bowl of meat and potato soup with dill. In the end I figured out they were from Tajikistan.\n\nKazan Cathedral - Russian Orthodox Church - Next up on this travel guide tour, we visited Kazan Cathedral, one of the iconic landmarks of Saint Petersburg. We proceeded to walking around the Church of the Savior on Blood - Russian Orthodox Church, and finally St. Isaac's Cathedral.

It was a fantastic area, a quiet and friendly neighborhood, but just a short distance from downtown Copenhagen. In this video, I\u2019m going to give you a full video of our apartment in Copenhagen.\n\nVesterbro - When I mentioned we were staying in Vesterbro to many locals in Copenhagen, many mentioned that they loved the area, and that it was one of their favorite neighborhoods in Copenhagen. And I figured out why pretty quickly - the area is quiet and peaceful, yet not far from downtown, it has a nice friendly feel to it, and there are many great restaurants, cafes, and shops in the area. I would highly recommend Vesterbro when you visit or live in Copenhagen, I loved the area.\n\nTotal price - The price to rent this apartment on a short term basis like we did, was $189 per night, which came with two bedrooms, and a full house. It\u2019s still not cheap, but when you compare it to a hotel room in Copenhagen, it\u2019s much more affordable and you get much more space.\n\nThank you for watching living in Denmark, apartment tour in Copenhagen!\n\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

It was a fantastic area, a quiet and friendly neighborhood, but just a short distance from downtown Copenhagen. In this video, I\u2019m going to give you a full video of our apartment in Copenhagen.\n\nVesterbro - When I mentioned we were staying in Vesterbro to many locals in Copenhagen, many mentioned that they loved the area, and that it was one of their favorite neighborhoods in Copenhagen. And I figured out why pretty quickly - the area is quiet and peaceful, yet not far from downtown, it has a nice friendly feel to it, and there are many great restaurants, cafes, and shops in the area. I would highly recommend Vesterbro when you visit or live in Copenhagen, I loved the area.\n\nTotal price - The price to rent this apartment on a short term basis like we did, was $189 per night, which came with two bedrooms, and a full house. It\u2019s still not cheap, but when you compare it to a hotel room in Copenhagen, it\u2019s much more affordable and you get much more space.\n\nThank you for watching living in Denmark, apartment tour in Copenhagen!\n\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Total bill for this huge Danish lunch platter - 718 DKK ($106.43)\n\nHey Captain (https://www.heycaptain.dk/) - One of the attractions I was most interested in doing during my time in Copenhagen, was to take a boat Copenhagen Canal Tour. Thanks to Visit Copenhagen and Hey Captain, for taking me on this fantastic and luxurious canal boat tour of Copenhagen. The drinks made it even better. Amazing boat tour, highly recommended in Copenhagen.\n\nFolkehuset Absalon (https://goo.gl/maps/Sjq2tUUrg9LsRa6k9) - Finally for dinner we went o Folkehuset Absalon, a former church that has been opened as a community center coffee shop, and a family style restaurant at dinner. The place is packed every night, people come looking for a social dining atmosphere, sharing tables, and delicious home cooked styles Danish food. Food was delicious.

It's easily among the world's best airports, in terms of organization, things to do, food, and access to internet. If you fly in or out of Seoul Incheon International Airport, or if you have a layover, it's a good airport to be in. #Seoul #SouthKorea #airport\n\nIn this Seoul Incheon International Airport tour, we were flying out of Seoul, and have a few extra hours to walk around the airport. But completely unplanned, I say Shake Shack at the entrance of the airport, and couldn't resist the opportunity to eat a double shack - it was delicious.\n\nRobots - Something you'll notice at Seoul Incheon International Airport are the robots that help with information - they seemed to follow us around a little bit. It's pretty cool, and you can talk to them.\n\nLounge - There are plenty of non-lounge lounges, that are fantastic at the airport and great for spending time in, but with a Priority Pass (from a credit card I use), I had access to one of the lounges. Food is overall, pretty good, with Korean food, kimchi, rice, and bulgogi.\n\nThat completes this full tour of Seoul Incheon International Airport, including Shake Shack!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

It's easily among the world's best airports, in terms of organization, things to do, food, and access to internet. If you fly in or out of Seoul Incheon International Airport, or if you have a layover, it's a good airport to be in. #Seoul #SouthKorea #airport\n\nIn this Seoul Incheon International Airport tour, we were flying out of Seoul, and have a few extra hours to walk around the airport. But completely unplanned, I say Shake Shack at the entrance of the airport, and couldn't resist the opportunity to eat a double shack - it was delicious.\n\nRobots - Something you'll notice at Seoul Incheon International Airport are the robots that help with information - they seemed to follow us around a little bit. It's pretty cool, and you can talk to them.\n\nLounge - There are plenty of non-lounge lounges, that are fantastic at the airport and great for spending time in, but with a Priority Pass (from a credit card I use), I had access to one of the lounges. Food is overall, pretty good, with Korean food, kimchi, rice, and bulgogi.\n\nThat completes this full tour of Seoul Incheon International Airport, including Shake Shack!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

The Cheonggyecheon Stream is like a pedestrian park highway, right through the center of the city, and you never need to wait to cross roads.\n\nGwangjang Market - While most of the time people known Gwangjang Market for its street food market (myself included), it\u2019s actually a huge market with everything available, from clothes to cooking supplies to cosmetics. I\u2019m happy with my grill purchase.\n\nPoong Chun Jang Eo Restaurant - Finally for lunch we took the subway over to Poong Chun Jang Eo Restaurant, a restaurant that serves fresh Korean eel.

A lot of the accommodation in Seoul is apartments and sky rises since it\u2019s such a cosmopolitan huge city.\n\nI booked this apartment on Airbnb. If you use this link you can get $40 off your booking at no extra cost: https://www.airbnb.com/c/markw149\n\nHololok Coffee - Just across the street from our apartment was a coffee shop called Hololok Coffee. For me the coffee was on the weak side, but it was a nice place to sit and hang out.\n\nThank you for watching, and be sure to subscribe and click the bell icon to get notified of more travel videos!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

The atmosphere is spectacular and it was a great opportunity to see the food being prepared by the amazing women and then to taste each and every dish.\n\nLebanese Food Buffet - First on the buffet, they had the entire meze salad sections, with all the familiar Lebanese classics like hummus and labneh.

A few of my favorite dishes were the marinated and grilled trout, and the Aleppo style kebabs in cherry sauce.\n\nAlong with delicious food and the variety of Lebanese food, one of the highlights of eating at Tawlet Ammiq is amazing atmosphere under the trees and the view over the Beqaa Valley.\n\nAn amazing restaurant and place to visit when you\u2019re in Lebanon.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \n\u201cBetter Together\u201d\nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

The rooms are each different, all with a Middle Eastern Oriental theme.\n\nBreakfast - Before starting the room tour, we had breakfast and you can choose to either sit outside on the rooftop in the garden terrace, or inside the lounge. We chose the lounge for the ambiance and the classic antiques. Lebanese breakfast was delicious, traditional dishes, great quality.\n\nRooftop swimming pool - The highlight of Hotel Albergo was taking a swim in the rooftop swimming pool that also has a nice bar and a wonderful panoramic view of Beirut!\n\nIt was a short 1 night stay, but we had a great time.

It\u2019s a city that\u2019s been through a lot, but the people hold it together. In this simple and fun travel guide to Beirut, we\u2019ll eat some delicious food and visit some of the famous sights of Beirut. #Beirut #Lebanon\n\nKamel - Feryal Boutique: https://www.instagram.com/feryal.boutique/\n\nFeryal - Mouneh Boutique (https://goo.gl/maps/z3C9yuj8vRcKYTBU7) - Kamel and his family source the best food products and ingredients from across Lebanon. I bought some sour young grape juice and pomegranate molasses to bring home to Thailand with me. Go say hi to Kamel when you\u2019re in Beirut!\n\nBasterma Mano (https://goo.gl/maps/C5rrEn2jLyqnVsLS6) - The highlight here is the soujouk on the shawarma, and it\u2019s delicious. The basterma is good too, but the soujouk was the winner for me. Soujouk Sandwich - 5,000 LBP ($3.32)\n\nMossis Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/uvH9ddd4NFXt27VC9) - Since we were in the area, Kamel knew another sandwich shop he\u2019d been going to for years. We had roast beef, soujouk, and the kind owners gave us a plate of basterma on the side - delicious. Sandwich - 6,000 LBP ($3.98)\n\nAl Falamanki Raouche - This is a cafe and restaurant serving all sorts of Lebanese food, and one of the highlights of coming here is to enjoy the amazing views of the iconic Raouche Rocks - Pigeons\u2019 Rock. It\u2019s not cheap, but a very nice place to hang out in Beirut.\n\nNext on this tour of Beirut, we stopped at the beautiful Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque and Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in the heart of Beirut. And lastly, we walked along the gorgeous Corniche Beirut waterfront.\n\nHotel Albergo (https://goo.gl/maps/5ndJzdavkRBnV5oQ9) - We were invited for a rooftop sunset drink at the top of Hotel Albergo, a beautiful historical hotel in Beirut. The view was outstanding, and a perfect was to finish a day in Beirut.\n\nHope you enjoyed this simple Beirut travel guide!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \n\u201cUnchained\u201d\nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Ceviche was pretty good, and a nice atmosphere and staff. Total price - 196 PEN ($59.33)\n\nParque Kennedy - This is a main landmark and park in Miraflores. It\u2019s great to walk around, stroll, and people hang out at the park until l ate at night. You can also stop at Parroquia La Virgen Milagrosa church when you\u2019re there.\n\nLarcomar - This is the major open air shopping center in Lima, overlooking the coast. It\u2019s nicely done, and I like the cafes overlooking the water.\n\nPuku Puku Caf\u00e9 Larco - I started with an Americano - 7.50 PEN ($2.27), and it was wonderful. I like how they use local Peruvian coffee. Then Sebastian offered to make us a Mochaccino. That was very nice of him, and it was delicious, my first time to have a mochaccino. Thank you Sebastian!\n\nWong Supermarket - Finally, right in the heart of Miraflores, across the street from Kennedy Park is Wong Supermarket - a gourmet, kind of expensive, but very nice supermarket.\n\nLima is an amazing city to travel to or to live in, and Miraflores is a great area of the city to base yourself in.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \n\u201cLiability\u201d\nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udfe0Get $40 OFF Booking Accommodation on Airbnb: \nhttps://www.airbnb.com/c/markw149\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.com/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

It\u2019s the biggest city in the Amazon, and it\u2019s surrounded by massive rivers and jungles. I was so excited to be there. We landed in the mid-afternoon, so we just had a few hours to walk around and explore, and get our first impressions of the Amazon. #Manaus #BrazilianFood #Amazon\n\nMercure Manaus Hotel - Thank you to Mercure Manaus Hotel for hosting all of us during our stay in Manaus, and for the amazing dinner.\n\nWe first drove to the market where we sampled a few local fruits. Most of the fruit stalls were closed, but a few were open and mainly we tried Cupua\u00e7u and a type of wild passion fruit.\n\nAmazon Theatre - One of the most important landmarks and sights of Manaus is the Amazon Theater, a beautiful theater in the middle of the city.\n\nRestaurante Canto da Peixada - I wanted to try a local freshwater fish dinner before going back to the hotel, so we stopped to eat a grilled tambaqui, one of the prized fish of Manaus, Brazil. It was delicious. Total price - 89.70 BRL ($22.96)\n\nDinner at Amazon Restaurant at Mercure Hotel Manaus - Finally we were invited for dinner back at the hotel where they prepared us an amazing Amazon meal including a huge mix of dishes. I didn\u2019t even know I was digging into the piranha soup, and it was so good. Freshwater turtle is also a major part of the Amazonian food diet.\n\nIt was a great few hours and my first impressions of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.\n\nThanks to Guilherme and Rafa from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

It\u2019s a beautiful city, very modern and metropolitan, and it\u2019s one of the most well known states in Brazil for food. In this video, we just had a day off and walked around, ate lunch, went to a coffee shop, and visited some attractions in the city like Pra\u00e7a da Liberdade. (NOTE: Watch my full Belo Horizonte food tour here: https://youtu.be/b1Ys_IYpMsg) #BeloHorizonte #coffee #travelvlogs\n\nPrato feito - plate of the day - Here\u2019s a term to know in Portuguese when you visit Brazil, which means the plate of the day. Plenty of simple restaurants will serve a plate of the day option that\u2019s all you need on one plate. Today was the pork ribs, with collard greens, rice and cassava. Price - 13 BRL ($3.24) per plate\n\nRental car - about $65 per day - Throughout our Trip to Brazil, we rented cars in every city we visited, usually with Hertz (Localiza). Price came to about $65 per day.\n\nOOP Caf\u00e9 - We continued on to OOP Caf\u00e9, one of the best cafes in Belo Horizonte serving gourmet freshly roasted Brazilian coffee. Great place to have fantastic coffee when you\u2019re in Belo Horizonte. Price - 7 BRL ($1.74) per cup\n\nPra\u00e7a da Liberdade - Finally in this visiting tour of attractions and daily living life in Brazil, we walked around Pra\u00e7a da Liberdade, a center square in the city, a park, and I especially loved the imperial palm trees. Big bottle water - 6 BRL ($1.49)\n\nThanks to Guilherme and Rafa from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

Sandwich the day before in Curitiba, we decided to take a historic train ride to Morretes. Morretes is a beautiful little town and happens to be known for barreado, a unique Brazilian banana meat stew. #Morretes #Brazil #BrazilianFood\n\nSerra Verde Express - Historically it was used as cargo transportation, things grown in Morretes, to Curitiba. Now the train is used for entertainment and people from across Brazil come to take the incredibly beautiful leisure train ride for the spectacular views of the forest and mountains. The train ride was a little slow, but fun, and the views were spectacular. It took about 3.5 hours and we arrived in Morretes, a steamy jungle town.\nTrain ride - 125 BRL ($30.96) per person\n\nHotel e Restaurante Nhundiaquara - After walking around Morretes for a few minutes, we headed straight to Hotel e Restaurante Nhundiaquara, one of the classic restaurants serving barreado. In order to assemble a plate of Barreado, you take some meat stew cooked in a clayport, add in cassava powder, and mash it around. Then you add banana - not plantain or cooking banana - but just straight real sweet bananas. It\u2019s very unique and unlike any other dish I\u2019ve eaten. Overall I enjoyed it, it was simple in taste, but with the balance of salty and sweet, and plenty of different textures.\nPrice - 39 BRL ($9.66) per person\n\nThanks to Guilherme and Rafa from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

Not only can you fly on Lufthansa to visit Germany, but there are many connecting flights and therefore many layovers in Frankfurt. \n\nSo what should you do with a long layover in Frankfurt, Germany?\n\nI had something like 15 hours, but even having  8 hours would be plenty of time to get to the center or Frankfurt for some sightseeing, German food and walking around.\n\nFirst step is to get out of the airport and catch the train into the center of Frankfurt - that can be a little confusing as Frankfurt Airport is kind of confusing. Anyway, navigate your way to the train station at the airport. There you can buy a ticket - I bought a 5 people group ticket for 16.60 EUR. They had other pricing options as well.\n\nFrankfurt (Main) Hauptwache - This is the center of Frankfurt and it took about 15 minutes from the airport.\n\nR\u00f6merberg - Just a 10 minute walk from Hauptwache station is R\u00f6merberg, the historical center of Frankfurt and a wonderful public square to walk around and do some sightseeing. But we continued walking to find some German food - specifically Frankfurt food.\n\nGastst\u00e4tte Atschel - This restaurant specializes in local Frankfurt German food. We ordered a number of dishes including apple wine and Frankfurter sausages with sauerkraut which are delicious and a food you can\u2019t miss. Total price - 47.60 EUR\n\nK\u00f6yl\u00fc-D\u00f6ner - Just down the road from Gastst\u00e4tte Atschel is K\u00f6yl\u00fc-D\u00f6ner, one of the best places in Frankfurt for a Turkish doner kebab which is very popular in Germany and absolutely delicious. Price - 4.90 EUR\n\nThe Holy Cross Brewing Society - Finally, just a last minute decision, we had a coffer at The Holy Cross Brewing Society which was wonderful. After coffee we headed back to Frankfurt Airport to catch our flight.\n\nIf you have a layover in Frankfurt, Germany, go out and explore and eat some food!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\ud83d\udcf7CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\n\u2022 Main camera: https://amzn.to/2vY66aL\n\u2022 Main lens: https://amzn.to/2Qa08Ne\n\u2022 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2YoG6kO\n\u2022 Microphone fur: https://amzn.to/2LLDKuQ\n\u2022 Mini tripod: https://amzn.to/2YsJeMz\n\u2022 Drone: https://amzn.to/2Yvhib2\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\n\u2022 Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\n\u2022 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\ud83c\udfa5Lufthansa Airlines Food Review:\nhttps://youtu.be/SA-SromGdGg",

I did not pay for my stay, but I was not required to post a video, and all thoughts in this video are my own.\n\nBeach Luxury Hotel, Karachi, Pakistan (Avani Hotels)\n\nThe hotel is one of the classic old hotels in Karachi, Pakistan. Some of the featured in the hotel are a little old and could do with a renovation, but at the same time that's part of what gives the hotels its charm and character. There's not really a beach, but more like a waterfront or lagoon front, but that does make for a nice ambiance.\n\nFirst we were invited by the manager to eat dinner at Casbah Restaurant, the hotels main seafood dinner restaurant. Food was good and seafood was fresh. At the same time, Atif Aslam was having a concert at the hotel. So we were able to listen to the concert while eating for an amazing atmosphere.\n\nWe had a great stay, than you again to Beach Luxury Hotel, Karachi, Pakistan!\n\nIf you book accommodation with my link https://bit.ly/2OEzeMr I'll receive a small commission at no expense to you.\n\nThank you for watching this Pakistani hotel review video.\n\nMusic: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \n\nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!",

I did not pay for my stay, but I was not required to post a video, and all thoughts in this video are my own.\n\nBeach Luxury Hotel, Karachi, Pakistan (Avani Hotels)\n\nThe hotel is one of the classic old hotels in Karachi, Pakistan. Some of the featured in the hotel are a little old and could do with a renovation, but at the same time that's part of what gives the hotels its charm and character. There's not really a beach, but more like a waterfront or lagoon front, but that does make for a nice ambiance.\n\nFirst we were invited by the manager to eat dinner at Casbah Restaurant, the hotels main seafood dinner restaurant. Food was good and seafood was fresh. At the same time, Atif Aslam was having a concert at the hotel. So we were able to listen to the concert while eating for an amazing atmosphere.\n\nWe had a great stay, than you again to Beach Luxury Hotel, Karachi, Pakistan!\n\nIf you book accommodation with my link https://bit.ly/2OEzeMr I'll receive a small commission at no expense to you.\n\nThank you for watching this Pakistani hotel review video.\n\nMusic: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \n\nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

This video shows the entire process, starting from Sapporo Station back to Bangkok.\n\nFirst of all, before catching the JR Rail train to the airport, I put my suitcase in a locker in Sapporo Station and had a quick lunch. They have a number of locker sizes, but many for 500 JPY ($4.48) for the day.\n\nJR Rail to Airport - 1,590 JPY ($14.26) - You can buy JR train tickets for cheaper if you don't reserve a seat, but you also run the risk of having to stand for the entire journey. But it's up to you, they have JR trains running in either direction and it's convenient and easy to use.\n\nNew Chitose Airport - We arrived to New Chitose Airport, the airport that serves Sapporo, and headed straight to catch our flight on Thai Airways.\n\nThe food serves on Thai Airways for this flight was Japanese food style because the plane left from Japan. Overall, food was ok, not the best airplane food I've had, but the bad.\n\nThank you for watching this Thai Airways food review videos!\n\nMusic: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \n\nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!",

They have a number of locker sizes, but many for 500 JPY ($4.48) for the day.\n\nJR Rail to Airport - 1,590 JPY ($14.26) - You can buy JR train tickets for cheaper if you don't reserve a seat, but you also run the risk of having to stand for the entire journey. But it's up to you, they have JR trains running in either direction and it's convenient and easy to use.\n\nNew Chitose Airport - We arrived to New Chitose Airport, the airport that serves Sapporo, and headed straight to catch our flight on Thai Airways.\n\nThe food serves on Thai Airways for this flight was Japanese food style because the plane left from Japan. Overall, food was ok, not the best airplane food I've had, but the bad.\n\nThank you for watching this Thai Airways food review videos!\n\nMusic: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \n\nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

I hadn't even really heard of Uzbekistan Airways before taking my first flight with them.\n\nThe airplane was a little bit on the older side, no personal tv's, which wasn't a problem for me since it wasn't that long of a flight, but with kind of aged bucket seats.\n\nFor dinner there was a choice of fish or chicken, I chose the chicken though I had a bite of the fish. The chicken came in patty form, in tomato sauce. They were alright, not the best airplane food I've ever had, but not bad.\n\nWe arrived safely in the middle of the night at Islam Karimov Tashkent International Airport, and were met by someone to escort us through customs - thank you Bekruz for arranging that - it was very convenient.\n\nIn Tashkent, we stayed at Wyndham Tashkent Hotel (aff link: https://goo.gl/zTX5FA)\n\nOverall, flight on Uzbekistan Airways was alright, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nThank you for watching this airline travel review!\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

I hadn't even really heard of Uzbekistan Airways before taking my first flight with them.\n\nThe airplane was a little bit on the older side, no personal tv's, which wasn't a problem for me since it wasn't that long of a flight, but with kind of aged bucket seats.\n\nFor dinner there was a choice of fish or chicken, I chose the chicken though I had a bite of the fish. The chicken came in patty form, in tomato sauce. They were alright, not the best airplane food I've ever had, but not bad.\n\nWe arrived safely in the middle of the night at Islam Karimov Tashkent International Airport, and were met by someone to escort us through customs - thank you Bekruz for arranging that - it was very convenient.\n\nIn Tashkent, we stayed at Wyndham Tashkent Hotel (aff link: https://goo.gl/zTX5FA)\n\nOverall, flight on Uzbekistan Airways was alright, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nThank you for watching this airline travel review!\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

It's a well known resort, isolated on its own beach and peninsula - and actually I didn't even know this at first, but you have to take a small boat ride to get there - you can't even drive there. So it's very quiet, very relaxing, and the natural beauty is spectacular.\n\nWe had a great time and really enjoyed some peace and relaxation. The food at the resort is pretty decent as well.\n\nCheck out Captain Hook Resort\u25ba https://www.agoda.com/captain-hook-resort/hotel/koh-kood-th.html?CID=1452029 (This is not sponsored, I paid for our stay, but this is an affiliate link)\n\nThank you for watching!\n\n--\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!",

It's a well known resort, isolated on its own beach and peninsula - and actually I didn't even know this at first, but you have to take a small boat ride to get there - you can't even drive there. So it's very quiet, very relaxing, and the natural beauty is spectacular.\n\nWe had a great time and really enjoyed some peace and relaxation. The food at the resort is pretty decent as well.\n\nCheck out Captain Hook Resort\u25ba https://www.agoda.com/captain-hook-resort/hotel/koh-kood-th.html?CID=1452029 (This is not sponsored, I paid for our stay, but this is an affiliate link)\n\nThank you for watching!\n\n--\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

It was just a very short 30 minute flight from Vientiane to Luang Prabang, but it all went smoothly. We checked in at Vientiane and went through security in about 15 minutes.

But the bus is quite a long journey, and with a baby, on this trip we decided to fly with Lao Airlines.\n\nLao Airlines is the national airline of Laos. It was just a very short 30 minute flight from Vientiane to Luang Prabang, but it all went smoothly. We checked in at Vientiane and went through security in about 15 minutes. The flight was only about 30 minutes, and we landed in Luang Prabang.\n\nYou can watch all the Lao food videos here: https://bit.ly/2EKXm9P\n\nThank you for watching this Lao Airlines food and travel review.\n\n----\n\nMusic: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \n\nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

So on our recent trip to Vientiane, Laos, I checked the prices of the flights, and we got a good deal, so I went for it.\n\nFor starters, you'll notice great service, from the check in process, to the lounge, to the flight. But the pink sandwiches... haha, they were actually pretty good.\n\nOur flight was very short, but it was a great flight and we arrived to Vientiane safe and sound.\n\nHave you flown with Bangkok Airways before?

So on our recent trip to Vientiane, Laos, I checked the prices of the flights, and we got a good deal, so I went for it.\n\nFor starters, you'll notice great service, from the check in process, to the lounge, to the flight. But the pink sandwiches... haha, they were actually pretty good.\n\nOur flight was very short, but it was a great flight and we arrived to Vientiane safe and sound.\n\nHave you flown with Bangkok Airways before? Thank you for watching this Bangkok Airways review.\n\nCheck out my Vientiane Travel Guide\u25ba https://migrationology.com/travel-guides/vientiane-laos/\n\n----\n\nMusic: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \n\nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

On a side note, it's an amazing city, well worth visiting for the amazing food, great colonial heritage, and overall it's just so pleasant. You can watch my full Merida food tour guide here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUCy6V1YE0w\n\nI was with my wife, our baby, and my buddy Carlos and his wife and baby as well. So there were 4 adults, 2 babies. This Spanish colonial house in Merida was a beauty, nicely restored, and very well decorated. I especially loved the colorful tiles on the floor and the outside courtyard and swimming pool area.\n\nWe just had a short stay at this accommodation in Merida, but it was very fun and a very nice place.\n\nThank you for watching!\n\nIf you want to use Airbnb, you can use my affiliate link here: https://goo.gl/yWJmFA to get $33 off your first booking.\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: Spanish Flavour - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!",

On a side note, it's an amazing city, well worth visiting for the amazing food, great colonial heritage, and overall it's just so pleasant. You can watch my full Merida food tour guide here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUCy6V1YE0w\n\nI was with my wife, our baby, and my buddy Carlos and his wife and baby as well. So there were 4 adults, 2 babies. This Spanish colonial house in Merida was a beauty, nicely restored, and very well decorated. I especially loved the colorful tiles on the floor and the outside courtyard and swimming pool area.\n\nWe just had a short stay at this accommodation in Merida, but it was very fun and a very nice place.\n\nThank you for watching!\n\nIf you want to use Airbnb, you can use my affiliate link here: https://goo.gl/yWJmFA to get $33 off your first booking.\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: Spanish Flavour - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

We live along with Ying's parents and her sister. There are five adults and one baby living in this house, and we still have 3 extra spare bedrooms!\n\nBangkok, Thailand living expenses / cost of living:\nHouse rent - 20,000 THB ($601.69) per month\nElectricity - 3,000 THB ($90.25) per month\nWater - 250 THB ($7.52) per month\nInternet - 1,200 THB ($36.10) per month\n\nOverall, for the area we live in and the space of the house, for Bangkok we're getting a pretty good deal. You can get much cheaper places living in rural areas of Thailand, but in the city in a good location, this is a very good deal.\n\nI hope this living in Thailand, Bangkok house tour gives you a good idea about living conditions and houses you could potentially rent in Bangkok.\n\nThank you for watching!\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!",

We live along with Ying's parents and her sister. There are five adults and one baby living in this house, and we still have 3 extra spare bedrooms!\n\nBangkok, Thailand living expenses / cost of living:\nHouse rent - 20,000 THB ($601.69) per month\nElectricity - 3,000 THB ($90.25) per month\nWater - 250 THB ($7.52) per month\nInternet - 1,200 THB ($36.10) per month\n\nOverall, for the area we live in and the space of the house, for Bangkok we're getting a pretty good deal. You can get much cheaper places living in rural areas of Thailand, but in the city in a good location, this is a very good deal.\n\nI hope this living in Thailand, Bangkok house tour gives you a good idea about living conditions and houses you could potentially rent in Bangkok.\n\nThank you for watching!\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

It was my first time to fly with them, and overall the flights were very nice and service was good. I was also impressed that, even though we were in economy class, even on the short flight from Lombok to Jakarta, they served us a meal.\n\nThe newly opened Jakarta International Airport terminal for Garuda Indonesia was also very nice, newly opened, and extremely clean. On my previous trip to Jakarta they new airport hadn't been opened yet.\n\nThe food on Garuda Indonesia Airline was decent, not the best airplane food I've had, but ok. \n\nThank you for watching this Garuda Indonesian Airline review video!\n\n----\n\nMusic: Dress Code - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \n\nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!",

It was my first time to fly with them, and overall the flights were very nice and service was good. I was also impressed that, even though we were in economy class, even on the short flight from Lombok to Jakarta, they served us a meal.\n\nThe newly opened Jakarta International Airport terminal for Garuda Indonesia was also very nice, newly opened, and extremely clean. On my previous trip to Jakarta they new airport hadn't been opened yet.\n\nThe food on Garuda Indonesia Airline was decent, not the best airplane food I've had, but ok. \n\nThank you for watching this Garuda Indonesian Airline review video!\n\n----\n\nMusic: Dress Code - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \n\nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

So I didn't pay for my stay, but I wasn't required in any way to make this video. I made it because I wanted to.\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nSofitel is one of the well known beach resorts in Nusa Dua, Bali. They hooked us up with a very nice room with direct access to the swimming pool -  which is  probably one of the coolest features of the hotel. The service was great, and I think the breakfast buffet was excellent. It's a laid back place to stay in Bali, so laid back and relaxing, that my wife and I barely even wanted to go anywhere when we were staying there. Sofitel in Bali is the type of resort where you can just stay the entire day, relaxing, and swimming and not go anywhere.\n\nAs for the beach, it's not the most amazing beach. The views are fantastic, but for actually beach swimming, it's not the best you'll see. Also another drawback I found is that Nusa Dua is kind of a secluded resort area in Bali. So in order to get our of the resort area you need to take a  taxi, you can't just walk out and find street food.\n\nAgain, I didn't pay, but I searched and found that this room sometimes goes for around $400, however it could fluctuate quite a bit by season - and I was there in high season.\n\nThank you to Sofitel Nusa Dua Bali for hosting my family in Bali. We had an amazing stay.\n\nThank you for watching!\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: Solar - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!",

They hooked us up with a very nice room with direct access to the swimming pool -  which is  probably one of the coolest features of the hotel. The service was great, and I think the breakfast buffet was excellent. It's a laid back place to stay in Bali, so laid back and relaxing, that my wife and I barely even wanted to go anywhere when we were staying there. Sofitel in Bali is the type of resort where you can just stay the entire day, relaxing, and swimming and not go anywhere.\n\nAs for the beach, it's not the most amazing beach. The views are fantastic, but for actually beach swimming, it's not the best you'll see. Also another drawback I found is that Nusa Dua is kind of a secluded resort area in Bali. So in order to get our of the resort area you need to take a  taxi, you can't just walk out and find street food.\n\nAgain, I didn't pay, but I searched and found that this room sometimes goes for around $400, however it could fluctuate quite a bit by season - and I was there in high season.\n\nThank you to Sofitel Nusa Dua Bali for hosting my family in Bali. We had an amazing stay.\n\nThank you for watching!\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: Solar - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\n\u25baT-shirts and caps available here: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

If you come here, you can eat some delicious grilled meat at this restaurant: https://youtu.be/B9YYr6BONYg\n\nAnd that completes this Athens evening walk and neighborhood tour.\n\nThank you very much for watching and I'll see you on the next travel video!\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: Locked Out - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationolology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

In this video, I'll give you a full review of our flight and especially show you the food on the flight and at the Munich Airport.\n\nFirst of all, we arrived to Munich Airport, and we were really hungry. I didn't know at the time, but Munich Airport is ranked as one of the best in the world, and it's very nicely designed.\n\nFirst, we stopped at Dallmayr, a German cafe and restaurant to have breakfast. Total price - 32.70 EUR\n\nOur flight left on time, and we were served a full lunch on Aegean Airlines including pasta and chicken. It was alright, not bad at all.\n\nThere's wasn't too much leg space on our plane, but overall, it was a great flight with Aegean Airlines.\n\nThank you for watching this airplane food flight review!\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n--\n\nMusic: Cause I Am Coming Home - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\nI would love to connect with you!\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nThank you for watching!",

In this video, I'll give you a full review of our flight and especially show you the food on the flight and at the Munich Airport.\n\nFirst of all, we arrived to Munich Airport, and we were really hungry. I didn't know at the time, but Munich Airport is ranked as one of the best in the world, and it's very nicely designed.\n\nFirst, we stopped at Dallmayr, a German cafe and restaurant to have breakfast. Total price - 32.70 EUR\n\nOur flight left on time, and we were served a full lunch on Aegean Airlines including pasta and chicken. It was alright, not bad at all.\n\nThere's wasn't too much leg space on our plane, but overall, it was a great flight with Aegean Airlines.\n\nThank you for watching this airplane food flight review!\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationolgy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationololgy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n--\n\nMusic: Cause I Am Coming Home - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nMain camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\n2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8h\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nGoillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\nI would love to connect with you!\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nThank you for watching!"

One of the most affordable airlines that has plenty of flights connecting Asia and Europe is Emirates Airlines.\n\nEmirates has consistently been rated as one of the best airlines in the world.

In comparison to hotels in Tel Aviv though, for that amount of space, I found them to be quite expensive and in high demand as well.\n\nMy wife, son, and I had a great stay at this apartment in Tel Aviv!\n\nIf you want to use Airbnb, you can use my affiliate link here: https://goo.gl/yWJmFA to get $32 off your first booking.\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: Running in the Wind - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\nThank you for watching!"

It was very expensive, but it was truly an amazing Japanese cultural experience and the food was incredible. There are cheaper Japanese ryokans you can stay at, but usually they have a public onsen (Japanese hot-spring bath), rather than a private.\n\nEver since taking my first trip to Japan a few years ago, I had really wanted to stay in a Japanese ryokan, which is a traditional inn, usually that is somewhere in the beautiful mountains, with a hotspring onsen bath, and delicious Japanese local food served in your room.\n\nOn my most recent trip to Tokyo, my wife and I took the train to Hakone, about 1.5 hours from Tokyo in the mountains, and decided to stay at a ryokan for 1 night. The experience was truly incredible and our room was amazing, including a private onsen bath and amazing Japanese gardens to view from the window.\n\nYoshiike Ryokan\n\uff15\uff19\uff17 Yumoto\n\u7bb1\u6839\u753a Hakone-machi, Ashigarashimo-gun, Kanagawa-ken 250-0311\nJapan\n\nRyokan food video coming soon on Main Channel!\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: Celestial Bodies - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\nThank you for watching!",

It was very expensive, but it was truly an amazing Japanese cultural experience and the food was incredible. There are cheaper Japanese ryokans you can stay at, but usually they have a public onsen (Japanese hot-spring bath), rather than a private.\n\nEver since taking my first trip to Japan a few years ago, I had really wanted to stay in a Japanese ryokan, which is a traditional inn, usually that is somewhere in the beautiful mountains, with a hotspring onsen bath, and delicious Japanese local food served in your room.\n\nOn my most recent trip to Tokyo, my wife and I took the train to Hakone, about 1.5 hours from Tokyo in the mountains, and decided to stay at a ryokan for 1 night. The experience was truly incredible and our room was amazing, including a private onsen bath and amazing Japanese gardens to view from the window.\n\nYoshiike Ryokan\n\uff15\uff19\uff17 Yumoto\n\u7bb1\u6839\u753a Hakone-machi, Ashigarashimo-gun, Kanagawa-ken 250-0311\nJapan\n\nRyokan food video coming soon on Main Channel!\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \nMy main channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n--\n\nMUSIC: Celestial Bodies - https://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\nCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):\nGH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQO\nMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf\nMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3z\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkI\n\nThank you for watching!"
