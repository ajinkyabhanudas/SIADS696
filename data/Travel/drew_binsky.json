My main YouTube channel (this account) was hacked by a crypto scammer in China.  He changed the name of my account to \u201cArk Invest\u201d, changed the profile picture, deleted all of my videos, and was live-streaming a Bitcoin video featuring Elon Musk's face on the thumbnail.  When I found out the news on a golf course in Wisconsin, I blacked out for 2 hours and couldn\u2019t speak... Seriously. Thankfully, YouTube has been SO responsive and amazing to help me recover my account, and now it's back in full health.  \n\nTHIS IS A PSA REMINDER TO CHANGE ALL YOUR PASSWORDS AND DON\u2019T CLICK ON RANDOM LINKS FROM RANDOM EMAILS.

My main YouTube channel (this account) was hacked by a crypto scammer in China.  He changed the name of my account to \u201cArk Invest\u201d, changed the profile picture, deleted all of my videos, and was live-streaming a Bitcoin video featuring Elon Musk's face on the thumbnail.  When I found out the news on a golf course in Wisconsin, I blacked out for 2 hours and couldn\u2019t speak... Seriously. Thankfully, YouTube has been SO responsive and amazing to help me recover my account, and now it's back in full health.  \n\nTHIS IS A PSA REMINDER TO CHANGE ALL YOUR PASSWORDS AND DON\u2019T CLICK ON RANDOM LINKS FROM RANDOM EMAILS.

Make sure to subscribe to their channel to enter their giveaway: https://youtube.com/c/SunOutdoorsOfficial\n\nEver since I was a kid, I\u2019ve been fascinated by the RV life in America. I think it\u2019s the greatest sub culture that we have in the USA, and I\u2019ve never fully understood it until I made this video! \n\nI spent 2 full days living out of an RV in Arches National Park, Utah. Yes - sleeping, cooking, and frolicking around an RV park/campsite! I met some really interesting RVers who were stationed next to me, and I honestly had the time of my life. I hope you enjoy this story! \n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nPS - There are a few more steps to enter the giveaway (see end of the video).

In the city of Novosibirsk, I walked into a traditional Russian bathhouse (called a banya), and I was greeted by a giant man named Herman. Herman ordered me to take off all my clothes and enter a 160-degree sauna (70C). I was then beaten by thorny Russian birch trees as well as a thick wooden stick. Then, I went outside to get an ice-cold bucket of water was poured on my head. \n\nThe Russian banya experience took me back to the time when I did a Turkish bath, but this one was more intense! I absolutely love doing these activities - it\u2019s the reason why I love traveling - to experience new cultures and learn about how other people spend their days. And truth be told, I felt very clean and relaxed after this bath \u2014 despite the pain that I went through!\n\nANNOUNCEMENT! I am really excited to share that my JUST GO APP is officially out for FREE on iPhone and android - and we already have 15,000 members!  JUST GO is an intimate place where you can connect, make new travel friends, join real-life meetups, and get inspired to travel! I launched my JUST GO community with Mighty Networks, an incredible all-in-one platform for community building (really, they are the BEST!) You can learn more about Mighty Networks on this link: https://www.mightynetworks.com/?via=drew\n\nLastly, I want to thank you for tuning into the last 5 weeks of stories in Russia/Siberia.  All content was filmed a month before Russia invaded Ukraine, so it comes with a very heavy heart.  I decided to share these videos because I strongly believe that the Russian people are NOT a representation on their crazy, evil dictator.  Please keep our friends and loved ones in Ukraine in your thoughts. It is absolutely horrible what they are going through, and I hope that this war ends soon.

In the city of Novosibirsk, I walked into a traditional Russian bathhouse (called a banya), and I was greeted by a giant man named Herman. Herman ordered me to take off all my clothes and enter a 160-degree sauna (70C). I was then beaten by thorny Russian birch trees as well as a thick wooden stick. Then, I went outside to get an ice-cold bucket of water was poured on my head. \n\nThe Russian banya experience took me back to the time when I did a Turkish bath, but this one was more intense! I absolutely love doing these activities - it\u2019s the reason why I love traveling - to experience new cultures and learn about how other people spend their days. And truth be told, I felt very clean and relaxed after this bath \u2014 despite the pain that I went through!\n\nANNOUNCEMENT! I am really excited to share that my JUST GO APP is officially out for FREE on iPhone and android - and we already have 15,000 members!  JUST GO is an intimate place where you can connect, make new travel friends, join real-life meetups, and get inspired to travel! I launched my JUST GO community with Mighty Networks, an incredible all-in-one platform for community building (really, they are the BEST!) You can learn more about Mighty Networks on this link: https://www.mightynetworks.com/?via=drew\n\nLastly, I want to thank you for tuning into the last 5 weeks of stories in Russia/Siberia.  All content was filmed a month before Russia invaded Ukraine, so it comes with a very heavy heart.  I decided to share these videos because I strongly believe that the Russian people are NOT a representation on their crazy, evil dictator.  Please keep our friends and loved ones in Ukraine in your thoughts. It is absolutely horrible what they are going through, and I hope that this war ends soon.

Sitting in that military compound for 3 hours, alone, without my phone or my friends was absolutely terrifying. \n\nAs many of you already know, I am fascinated by North Korea. I spent 4 days in Pyongyang in 2017 and I can even speak the Korean language (I lived in South Korea for 2 years).  Not a day goes by where I don\u2019t ponder about life in North Korea - the strangest and most isolated country in the world.\n\nBut Americans have been banned to visit North Korea since 2017 - a few months after I left. In fact, I think that I\u2019m one of the last few Americans to step foot in the country. \n\nSo I wanted to attempt to go back while traveling in Siberia.  And what happened to me is something that I\u2019ve never experienced and I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nThis is the full story of how I got detained on the North Korea / Russia border. The journey starts in the far Eastern city of Vladivostok.  \n\nThank you so much to my local friend Natasha for joining me on this wild adventure. Follow her YouTube videos to learn more about Eastern Russia! https://www.youtube.com/c/natashasadventures\n\nPS - This video was shot 4 weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine. I do NOT support this unprovoked war, and my thoughts go out to our friends in Ukraine.

Sitting in that military compound for 3 hours, alone, without my phone or my friends was absolutely terrifying. \n\nAs many of you already know, I am fascinated by North Korea. I spent 4 days in Pyongyang in 2017 and I can even speak the Korean language (I lived in South Korea for 2 years).  Not a day goes by where I don\u2019t ponder about life in North Korea - the strangest and most isolated country in the world.\n\nBut Americans have been banned to visit North Korea since 2017 - a few months after I left. In fact, I think that I\u2019m one of the last few Americans to step foot in the country. \n\nSo I wanted to attempt to go back while traveling in Siberia.  And what happened to me is something that I\u2019ve never experienced and I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nThis is the full story of how I got detained on the North Korea / Russia border. The journey starts in the far Eastern city of Vladivostok.  \n\nThank you so much to my local friend Natasha for joining me on this wild adventure. Follow her YouTube videos to learn more about Eastern Russia! https://www.youtube.com/c/natashasadventures\n\nPS - This video was shot 4 weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.

I\u2019ve always said that it\u2019s one of the most underrated countries in Europe. The historical sites and monuments are breathtaking. The people are very humble and friendly and I have nothing but incredible memories during my 10 day trip to Ukraine in 2015.\n\nI just spent 3 weeks traveling across Eastern Russia (Siberia) and while I really enjoyed my trip, in terms of culture and adventure \u2014 the politics just don\u2019t make sense to me. I just woke up to the news that Russia invaded Ukraine, and I don't understand why anyone wants to start another war.

I've been very interested in the Rastafarian culture since I got hooked on Bob Marley as a teenager. I mean, wasn't everyone obsessed with Bob Marley at some point in their lives?  He is a living legend! \n\nIt turns out that Bob Marley was one of the first people to bring his Rasta culture to all corners of the world.  And believe it or not, Rastafari is not just a culture or a social movement -- it's the world's newest religion that started in the 1930s (as an offshoot of Christianity).  Rasta people typically have dreadlocks, listen to reggae music, eat vegan food and smoke a lot of ganja. \n\nI went to Jamaica to learn more about the Rastafarian people, culture, and lifestyle -- and I ended up spending 48 hours with an amazing community in the Blue Mountains.

I've been very interested in the Rastafarian culture since I got hooked on Bob Marley as a teenager. I mean, wasn't everyone obsessed with Bob Marley at some point in their lives?  He is a living legend! \n\nIt turns out that Bob Marley was one of the first people to bring his Rasta culture to all corners of the world.  And believe it or not, Rastafari is not just a culture or a social movement -- it's the world's newest religion that started in the 1930s (as an offshoot of Christianity).  Rasta people typically have dreadlocks, listen to reggae music, eat vegan food and smoke a lot of ganja. \n\nI went to Jamaica to learn more about the Rastafarian people, culture, and lifestyle -- and I ended up spending 48 hours with an amazing community in the Blue Mountains.

It feels surreal to be able to say the sentence, \u201cI have been to every single country in the world!\u201d There will be many incredible stories being made these next 2 weeks as I travel across Saudi Arabia. \n\nBut let\u2019s not forget about Palau! This is my last video from this beautiful Pacific-island nation, and it\u2019s one of my favorites!  Palau has a population of less than 18,000 residents. For comparison, my University (Wisconsin-Madison) was two times larger than that! \n\nI challenged myself to see if I could throw the biggest meet-up/party that this country has ever seen.

It feels surreal to be able to say the sentence, \u201cI have been to every single country in the world!\u201d There will be many incredible stories being made these next 2 weeks as I travel across Saudi Arabia. \n\nBut let\u2019s not forget about Palau! This is my last video from this beautiful Pacific-island nation, and it\u2019s one of my favorites!  Palau has a population of less than 18,000 residents. For comparison, my University (Wisconsin-Madison) was two times larger than that! \n\nI challenged myself to see if I could throw the biggest meet-up/party that this country has ever seen. In order to do that, I had to get permission from the Palau\u2019s Visitors Authority as well as the President himself.  \n\nLet\u2019s just say that it was one of the most fun events I\u2019ve ever thrown!!!  I hope you enjoy this story, and thanks for watching my Palau series.

I've been to over 700 airports around the world, and Angaur Terminal in the Pacific island nation of Palau is by far the SMALLEST!!!  \n\nMy local friend Sachi and I took a propeller plane down to Pelileu, but we decided to take a pit stop in Angaur only to see this terminal.  It has so much charm and character!  There are no walls, no bathrooms, and no electricity. There's no TSA pre-check or security lines.   Just a tiny bench to sit on while you wait for your plane to arrive.  For aviation geeks like me, this was really special to experience and just another reason to love Palau!\n\nREAL LIFE UPDATE:  I am touching down in Saudi Arabia in 4 days -- MY 197th AND FINAL COUNTRY!!  Stay tuned for a huge video drop when I arrive which explains my biggest realization from visiting every country in the world, and what's next for Drew Binsky.

Have you ever heard of Palau before?  It's one of the most beautiful countries in the world in terms of beaches and nature -- but it's also one of the most expensive because almost everything here needs to be imported.  With that being said, find out how many things I could purchase around the island for $10.  \n\nWatch this video until the end, it takes an emotional turn when I get to Pelileu. The island where my Grandpa Jack fought in WWII and got shot in the leg.  Before he passed away a few months ago, I was able to hear his harrowing Palau battle stories and I traced his footsteps. Thanks for watching, it means a lot to me.  RIP Grandpa \u2764\ufe0f\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky  for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#Palau #Travel #DrewBinsky\n\n\ud83d\udc55 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO \ud83c\udf0e: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 TEXT ME, I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\u2708\ufe0f BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\ud83d\udc6b JOIN over 65,000 people in my FB travel community!  https://bit.ly/3uomRZb\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25ba IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25ba FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25ba Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Have you ever heard of Palau before?  It's one of the most beautiful countries in the world in terms of beaches and nature -- but it's also one of the most expensive because almost everything here needs to be imported.  With that being said, find out how many things I could purchase around the island for $10.  \n\nWatch this video until the end, it takes an emotional turn when I get to Pelileu. The island where my Grandpa Jack fought in WWII and got shot in the leg.  Before he passed away a few months ago, I was able to hear his harrowing Palau battle stories and I traced his footsteps. Thanks for watching, it means a lot to me.  RIP Grandpa \u2764\ufe0f\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky  for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#Palau #Travel #DrewBinsky\n\n\ud83d\udc55 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO \ud83c\udf0e: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 TEXT ME, I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\u2708\ufe0f BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\ud83d\udc6b JOIN over 65,000 people in my FB travel community!  https://bit.ly/3uomRZb\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25ba IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25ba FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25ba Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Many of you have been asking about Noor -- my beloved Afghan friend and tour guide.

They managed to get on one of the final evacuation military airplanes out of Kabul.

But truth be told, life of a full time traveler is not always rainbows and ponies.  Not at all.\n\nIn this video, I open up to you a bit and share why AIRPORTS are the most stressful part of the travel experience for me.   Airports are the main driver for my severe anxiety -- because of all the immigration questions, checkpoints, police encounters -- while trying to hide my identity as a YouTuber.   Because believe it or not, being a YouTuber (i.e. Journalist) is frowned upon in MANY countries around the world. \n\nDoes anyone else out there feel the same about airports?

But truth be told, life of a full time traveler is not always rainbows and ponies.  Not at all.\n\nIn this video, I open up to you a bit and share why AIRPORTS are the most stressful part of the travel experience for me.   Airports are the main driver for my severe anxiety -- because of all the immigration questions, checkpoints, police encounters -- while trying to hide my identity as a YouTuber.   Because believe it or not, being a YouTuber (i.e. Journalist) is frowned upon in MANY countries around the world. \n\nDoes anyone else out there feel the same about airports?

I've had the time of my life traveling through this country and I hope you've enjoyed my stories here over the last 9 weeks. \n\nOn my final day in Iraq, I met up with my long time Iraqi friend, Baderkhan, who you might know well from the many videos we shot together in Iraqi Kurdistan.  We hit the streets of Baghdad (his hometown), and tried all of the best street food that the city has to offer!  We were able to eat 5 dishes for just $15USD total, now that's a bargain!\n\nLittle did we know how scary this video would be to shoot -- I left my passport in my hotel room (which is a BIG no-no in Iraq), so we tried to dodge the police the entire day.  If you can remember last week, I was thrown into a police station in the marshlands for using my GoPro... Find out if we made it to the end without any police encounters!\n\nAlso - it's with a heavy heart to explain that 24 hours after we shot this video, there was massive attack in the exact same market, on the exact same street, during the exact same time of the day.  I was devastated to hear the news, and I couldn't believe our luck - we escaped it by just 24 hours.   My deepest condolences go out to all of the loved ones that were lost in this horrible act, and I hope the city will return back to its glory days.\n\nThanks again for watching my videos and I look forward to sharing my next stories in Dubai and Mauritania!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on Insta! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky  \n\n#DrewBinsky #Baghdad #StreetFood\n\n\ud83c\udf0d MY ULTIMATE TRAVEL HACKING COURSE just went live and you can get 50% off if you use the discount code \"YOUTUBE!\" (this offer is only valid for the next 48 hours).  https://www.drewbinsky.com/course\nI made this course so you can become a better traveler and save money -- it has all of my best travel tips, secrets and resources that I've learned from visiting 194 countries.  \n\n\ud83d\udc55 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO \ud83c\udf0e: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 TEXT ME, I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\u2708\ufe0f BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\ud83d\udc6b JOIN over 65,000 people in my FB travel community!  https://bit.ly/3uomRZb\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25ba IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25ba FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25ba Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

I've had the time of my life traveling through this country and I hope you've enjoyed my stories here over the last 9 weeks. \n\nOn my final day in Iraq, I met up with my long time Iraqi friend, Baderkhan, who you might know well from the many videos we shot together in Iraqi Kurdistan.  We hit the streets of Baghdad (his hometown), and tried all of the best street food that the city has to offer!  We were able to eat 5 dishes for just $15USD total, now that's a bargain!\n\nLittle did we know how scary this video would be to shoot -- I left my passport in my hotel room (which is a BIG no-no in Iraq), so we tried to dodge the police the entire day.  If you can remember last week, I was thrown into a police station in the marshlands for using my GoPro... Find out if we made it to the end without any police encounters!\n\nAlso - it's with a heavy heart to explain that 24 hours after we shot this video, there was massive attack in the exact same market, on the exact same street, during the exact same time of the day.  I was devastated to hear the news, and I couldn't believe our luck - we escaped it by just 24 hours.   My deepest condolences go out to all of the loved ones that were lost in this horrible act, and I hope the city will return back to its glory days.\n\nThanks again for watching my videos and I look forward to sharing my next stories in Dubai and Mauritania!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on Insta! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky  \n\n#DrewBinsky #Baghdad #StreetFood\n\n\ud83c\udf0d MY ULTIMATE TRAVEL HACKING COURSE just went live and you can get 50% off if you use the discount code \"YOUTUBE!\" (this offer is only valid for the next 48 hours).  https://www.drewbinsky.com/course\nI made this course so you can become a better traveler and save money -- it has all of my best travel tips, secrets and resources that I've learned from visiting 194 countries.  \n\n\ud83d\udc55 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO \ud83c\udf0e: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 TEXT ME, I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\u2708\ufe0f BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\ud83d\udc6b JOIN over 65,000 people in my FB travel community!  https://bit.ly/3uomRZb\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25ba IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25ba FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25ba Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Well, not only did I just visit that exact place where the two rivers meet (in the center of Iraq), but I ventured deep into BABYLON.  This ancient civilization dates back to the 19th Century BC, and is absolutely mind blowing.   The best part is that my buddy Alvaro and I were THE ONLY ONES THERE. \n\nIf these ruins were in a country like Italy or Spain, then they would be the most visited sites on earth... But sadly, we are deep in the heart of Iraq, a nation that has been torn apart by war and turmoil over the last 30 years. \n\nI've been to 194 countries and I've seen a lot of cool things and places, but this ranks up there as one of the best.  It might just be number 1.  It's really hard to put into words the feeling of walking these grounds, which are still being excavated to this day. \n\nI hope that you guys enjoy our adventure around Babylon and that you learn something new.  I am so grateful to have this platform and be able to share my experiences with you, because so few outsiders get to come here.

Well, not only did I just visit that exact place where the two rivers meet (in the center of Iraq), but I ventured deep into BABYLON.  This ancient civilization dates back to the 19th Century BC, and is absolutely mind blowing.   The best part is that my buddy Alvaro and I were THE ONLY ONES THERE. \n\nIf these ruins were in a country like Italy or Spain, then they would be the most visited sites on earth... But sadly, we are deep in the heart of Iraq, a nation that has been torn apart by war and turmoil over the last 30 years. \n\nI've been to 194 countries and I've seen a lot of cool things and places, but this ranks up there as one of the best.  It might just be number 1.  It's really hard to put into words the feeling of walking these grounds, which are still being excavated to this day. \n\nI hope that you guys enjoy our adventure around Babylon and that you learn something new.  I am so grateful to have this platform and be able to share my experiences with you, because so few outsiders get to come here.   Thanks for reading this and I'll see you next week!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more stories from every country, and follow my trip to Iraq and beyond on IG Stories: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Babylon #Iraq\n\n\ud83d\udc55 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO \ud83c\udf0e: https://shop.drewbinsky.com/\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 TEXT ME, I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\u2708\ufe0f BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\ud83d\udc6b JOIN over 65,000 people in my FB travel community!  https://bit.ly/3uomRZb\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25ba IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25ba FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25ba Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

OMGGG I am so excited to share this video with you!! As someone who is going to every country (currently 194/197) -- Baghdad has been high on my list ever since I fell in love with Middle Eastern culture & hospitality back in 2015...  It's hard to explain in words how happy I am here, especially because I have this unique opportunity to share REAL LIFE things happening on these streets.  I can guarantee this is a Baghdad you've never heard about, or seen on the news.  \n\nIn today's $10 episode, which is my 50th so far (!!!), I take you through the bustling markets and around the city to see how many things I could purchase for $10 USD (14,000 Iraqi Dinars).

I am so sad to leave this country \u2013 it\u2019s my favorite in all of Latin America and I know that I\u2019ll be back someday soon!\n\nYou may have noticed that many of the videos in my Venezuela series have revolved around the unfortunate economical situation (etc) --  but in this video, I wanted to share with you the other side of the story...  The high class!  \n\nI was shocked to find out that Caracas has an ULTRA WEALTHY inner bubble, with expensive restaurants, swanky bars, high end shopping and exclusive golf clubs.   My friend Emmanuel (@DosLocosDeViaje) and I spent my last day in town exploring the luxury life, and it was a blast!\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading this, thank you from the bottom of my heart for tuning into this series.  Thank you for all of your comments, questions and thoughts.  It\u2019s a great opportunity to tell stories in a country as misconceived as Venezuela, and it's a true pleasure to open your eyes to real life, real people and real situations happening on these streets.   As for now, I\u2019m making a stop home (Arizona) before heading on a road trip around IRAQ Proper \u2013 stay tuned for more amazing stories!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more videos from every country, and join me on Instagram Stories! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Venezuela #Luxury\n\n\ud83d\udc55 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO \ud83c\udf0e: https://shop.drewbinsky.com/\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 TEXT ME, I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\u2708\ufe0f BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\ud83d\udc6b JOIN over 65,000 people in my FB travel community!  https://bit.ly/3uomRZb\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25ba IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25ba FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25ba Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

I am so sad to leave this country \u2013 it\u2019s my favorite in all of Latin America and I know that I\u2019ll be back someday soon!\n\nYou may have noticed that many of the videos in my Venezuela series have revolved around the unfortunate economical situation (etc) --  but in this video, I wanted to share with you the other side of the story...  The high class!  \n\nI was shocked to find out that Caracas has an ULTRA WEALTHY inner bubble, with expensive restaurants, swanky bars, high end shopping and exclusive golf clubs.   My friend Emmanuel (@DosLocosDeViaje) and I spent my last day in town exploring the luxury life, and it was a blast!\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading this, thank you from the bottom of my heart for tuning into this series.  Thank you for all of your comments, questions and thoughts.  It\u2019s a great opportunity to tell stories in a country as misconceived as Venezuela, and it's a true pleasure to open your eyes to real life, real people and real situations happening on these streets.   As for now, I\u2019m making a stop home (Arizona) before heading on a road trip around IRAQ Proper \u2013 stay tuned for more amazing stories!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more videos from every country, and join me on Instagram Stories! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Venezuela #Luxury\n\n\ud83d\udc55 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO \ud83c\udf0e: https://shop.drewbinsky.com/\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 TEXT ME, I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\u2708\ufe0f BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\ud83d\udc6b JOIN over 65,000 people in my FB travel community!  https://bit.ly/3uomRZb\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25ba IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25ba FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25ba Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

It's more than twice as severe as the U.S. Great Depression, and I simply cannot ignore this sad reality as I am visiting the country...  \n\nThe main driver for this economic crisis is oil. \n\nNearly a century ago, massive oil reserves were discovered off the Northern coast of Venezuela, which is why the country used to be the wealthiest in Latin America (in the 1960s and 1970s)... But sadly, a series of poor decisions, mismanagement and (recent) U.S. sanctions has crippled its economy to pieces.  Nowadays, despite having one of the world's largest oil reserves, there is a HUGE gas shortage and the locals have to wait in their car HOURS or even DAYS just to fill up their gas tank.  It's a very sad reality and I've never seen anything like it before in all of my travels to 194 countries.

Chuao was SO unexpected and beautiful... I am still pinching myself if this was a dream or if it was reality.\n\nIn this video, I take you on the journey to discover Chuao -- from the pristine, untouched beaches to the friendly, hospitable locals and the world famous cacao (which is soooo delicious!) This island is a paradise unlike any other I've seen through 194 countries, and I will absolutely be returning back here in the future.\n\nHonestly speaking, Venezuela is NOT as scary as you've heard about on the news - especially when you get outside of Caracas.  Yes, there is a devastating economic crisis and massive hyperinflation, but that doesn't mean that you will get robbed or shot at by walking around on the street.

Chuao was SO unexpected and beautiful... I am still pinching myself if this was a dream or if it was reality.\n\nIn this video, I take you on the journey to discover Chuao -- from the pristine, untouched beaches to the friendly, hospitable locals and the world famous cacao (which is soooo delicious!) This island is a paradise unlike any other I've seen through 194 countries, and I will absolutely be returning back here in the future.\n\nHonestly speaking, Venezuela is NOT as scary as you've heard about on the news - especially when you get outside of Caracas.  Yes, there is a devastating economic crisis and massive hyperinflation, but that doesn't mean that you will get robbed or shot at by walking around on the street.  It doesn't mean that there are no restaurants to eat at or things to do.   Life does exist, somewhat normally, in many parts of the country just like here in Chuao. \n\nIf you're still reading this, I want to say thank you so much for tuning into my videos in Venezuela.

The bus crashed around 1AM local time, in the middle of nowhere.

Markets give me a really good first impression for how my trip will unfold, and honestly, they are so much fun to experience!\n\nIn today's video, I take you on a journey inside my 5 favorite street markets around the world - from Afghanistan to Libya, Tajikistan, Iran and Syria - I hope you enjoy! \n\n#DrewBinsky #Market #StreetFood\n\nTEXT ME and I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\nElevate your videos with record-label quality music from Musicbed: http://share.mscbd.fm/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baINSTA: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25baTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

As soon as he found out that I was coming to visit his country, he reached out on Instagram and offered to show me around, alongside his brother Gustavo. \n\nI didn't know much about Esteban before we met, but after spending 12 days getting to know him across Ecuador, I learned that he is one of the strongest and most optimistic souls that I've ever met. \n\nSeveral years ago, his friend threw him out of a moving car and he lost 1/3rd of his skull.  Doctors weren't sure if he would make it.  He had to completely relearn how to speak Spanish and English from scratch.  \n\nBut through perseverance and positive thinking, Esteban has gotten back on his feet and is now living a normal life.    Here is his full story. \n\nThank you, Esteban and your brother Gustavo for showing me an incredible time around Ecuador.  I can't wait to be back again sometime soon!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more people stories in every country in the world.

As soon as he found out that I was coming to visit his country, he reached out on Instagram and offered to show me around, alongside his brother Gustavo. \n\nI didn't know much about Esteban before we met, but after spending 12 days getting to know him across Ecuador, I learned that he is one of the strongest and most optimistic souls that I've ever met. \n\nSeveral years ago, his friend threw him out of a moving car and he lost 1/3rd of his skull.  Doctors weren't sure if he would make it.  He had to completely relearn how to speak Spanish and English from scratch.  \n\nBut through perseverance and positive thinking, Esteban has gotten back on his feet and is now living a normal life.    Here is his full story. \n\nThank you, Esteban and your brother Gustavo for showing me an incredible time around Ecuador.  I can't wait to be back again sometime soon!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more people stories in every country in the world.

Well, the group is from Accra, Ghana, and I was able to track them down the other day and tell you their unbelievable story of how it all started. \n\nThe main guy, Benjamin Aidoo, first got the idea to turn a funeral into a celebration about 20 years ago, and today it has grown into a massive business with over 100 people working for him.  \n\nBenjamin and the guys have a really interesting perspective of death.  Instead of mourning the deceased, they decide to make it a huge celebration to bring happiness to their lives.   What do you guys think about this concept?\n\nWhat an amazing experience to meet the viral coffin dancers and learn about their lives.

My buddy Wode Maya and I were invited up here by a local singer, songwriter and all around superstar named Wiyaala, and she was kind enough to show us everything around her beloved hometown.   \n\nWiyaala is on another level of inspiring and sincere -- after coming from humble beginnings, she achieved massive international fame after winning a popular singing contest in Ghana several years ago... and now her songs are played from speakers all over the world.  But aside from her musical talents, Wiyaala has the kindest heart as you will see in this video.  Despite financial success and freedom, she chooses to live here in Funsi with her family and friends.  After traveling to 192 countries, I can say with confidence that the people in this village are the some of the friendliest and most hospitable on this planet -- and this has been an experience that I will never forget.\n\nThank you Wiyaala for hosting us and for being such a blessing to this world.   I encourage all of you to listen to her music, just search for it on YouTube! \n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more stories from every country in the world, and join me on Instagram:  https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Ghana #Africa\n\nTEXT ME and I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\nElevate your videos with record-label quality music from Musicbed: http://share.mscbd.fm/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baINSTA: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25baTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

My buddy Wode Maya and I were invited up here by a local singer, songwriter and all around superstar named Wiyaala, and she was kind enough to show us everything around her beloved hometown.   \n\nWiyaala is on another level of inspiring and sincere -- after coming from humble beginnings, she achieved massive international fame after winning a popular singing contest in Ghana several years ago... and now her songs are played from speakers all over the world.  But aside from her musical talents, Wiyaala has the kindest heart as you will see in this video.  Despite financial success and freedom, she chooses to live here in Funsi with her family and friends.  After traveling to 192 countries, I can say with confidence that the people in this village are the some of the friendliest and most hospitable on this planet -- and this has been an experience that I will never forget.\n\nThank you Wiyaala for hosting us and for being such a blessing to this world.   I encourage all of you to listen to her music, just search for it on YouTube! \n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more stories from every country in the world, and join me on Instagram:  https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Ghana #Africa\n\nTEXT ME and I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\nElevate your videos with record-label quality music from Musicbed: http://share.mscbd.fm/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baINSTA: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25baTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

It's been 10 LONG MONTHS since I have stepped foot in a new country, and I am excited as ever to explore this vibrant West African nation over the next 9 days. \n\nAlso, after a 6 month delay, I am finally shooting for my upcoming documentary (about visiting every country in the world and behind the scenes of my life as a content creator, etc). I have an awesome camera crew who flew out from L.A., and we will be shooting amazing stories to tell you guys in our really cool film, that will be available on a big streaming platform later in 2021. \n\nTo kick off my Ghana series with this $10 video, I teamed up with my buddy and fellow YouTuber named Woda Maya (his channel linked below).  Together, we hit the streets of Accra and Tamale to show off the amazing food, culture and people of Ghana!\n\nIf you have any tips for things to do or stories to film, please comment them below.  Or just say hi and I will get back to you!

In fact, I would honestly say that Afghanistan has some of the most underrated street food in the entire world.  All of the dishes here are so delicious, so plentiful and SO CHEAP!\n\nIn today's video, I take you on the streets of Bamiyan (in the central region of the country) to try some of the best Afghan street foods - IS ANYONE HUNGRY OUT THERE?! \n\nPlease note that this video was extremely hard to edit because just 2 weeks after I left Bamiyan, there were 2 massive blasts that destroyed the main marketplace, leaving 14 people dead and dozens more wounded.  100% of this video was shot in that exact marketplace, which is now in ruins, and I am just devastated.  \n\nIn any regard, Bamiyan (and Afghanistan as a whole) is one of my favorite place on earth -- the culture is so raw and authentic, and the people are some of the most hospitable in the world!  I am loving every second of this trip and I can't wait to tell you more stories from the wonderful country of Afghanistan. \n\nPS - Would you try any of these Afghan dishes? Comment below! \n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more stories from every country in the world, and join my trip live on Instagram!  https://instagram.com/drewbinsky \n\n#DrewBinsky #Afghanistan #StreetFood\n\nTEXT ME and I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\nGet your music on Musicbed!

In fact, I would honestly say that Afghanistan has some of the most underrated street food in the entire world.  All of the dishes here are so delicious, so plentiful and SO CHEAP!\n\nIn today's video, I take you on the streets of Bamiyan (in the central region of the country) to try some of the best Afghan street foods - IS ANYONE HUNGRY OUT THERE?! \n\nPlease note that this video was extremely hard to edit because just 2 weeks after I left Bamiyan, there were 2 massive blasts that destroyed the main marketplace, leaving 14 people dead and dozens more wounded.  100% of this video was shot in that exact marketplace, which is now in ruins, and I am just devastated.  \n\nIn any regard, Bamiyan (and Afghanistan as a whole) is one of my favorite place on earth -- the culture is so raw and authentic, and the people are some of the most hospitable in the world!  I am loving every second of this trip and I can't wait to tell you more stories from the wonderful country of Afghanistan. \n\nPS - Would you try any of these Afghan dishes?

Welcome to Kandahar, Afghanistan. \n\nKandahar is well known as being the headquarters of a Sunni Islamic political movement and military organization who is currently waging war within the country.    Since their uprising in the mid 1990s, Kandahar has been the home base where the group operates, and at one point in time (in the early 2000s), they controlled 95% of the country. \n\nI didn\u2019t originally plan to visit Kandahar on this trip around Afghanistan, but the city recently opened up (about a year ago) and there was a spontaneous opportunity to go there\u2026 And I couldn\u2019t decline it.\n\nSo why did I go to Kandahar, knowing that it is dangerous?   \n\nDespite all of the battle and conflict that the city has seen over the last 25 years, I knew that there is another side to the Kandahar story among its 1 million residents.  Having the chance to meet eye-to-eye with these innocent people, observing their lifestyle and witnessing the ancient wonders of Kandahar was enough motivation for me to go.  \n\nAnd after spending 48 hours in the city, all I can say is that it turned out to be one of the most incredible few days of my life.  \n\nIn this video, join me on a wild journey into Kandahar, Afghanistan. \n\nFollow @Drew Binsky   for more stories from every country, and join me on Instagram! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Afghanistan #Travel\n\nTEXT ME and I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\nGet your music on Musicbed!

Since their uprising in the mid 1990s, Kandahar has been the home base where the group operates, and at one point in time (in the early 2000s), they controlled 95% of the country. \n\nI didn\u2019t originally plan to visit Kandahar on this trip around Afghanistan, but the city recently opened up (about a year ago) and there was a spontaneous opportunity to go there\u2026 And I couldn\u2019t decline it.\n\nSo why did I go to Kandahar, knowing that it is dangerous?   \n\nDespite all of the battle and conflict that the city has seen over the last 25 years, I knew that there is another side to the Kandahar story among its 1 million residents.  Having the chance to meet eye-to-eye with these innocent people, observing their lifestyle and witnessing the ancient wonders of Kandahar was enough motivation for me to go.  \n\nAnd after spending 48 hours in the city, all I can say is that it turned out to be one of the most incredible few days of my life.  \n\nIn this video, join me on a wild journey into Kandahar, Afghanistan. \n\nFollow @Drew Binsky   for more stories from every country, and join me on Instagram! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Afghanistan #Travel\n\nTEXT ME and I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\nGet your music on Musicbed!

I'm back in Iraqi Kurdistan with my friend Baderkhan - remember him? The guy who has been to 70+ countries with the World's Worst Passport (Iraq)?\n\nI decided to make a sequel about his life because he is a such a good guy and has so many inspiring viewpoints and perspectives. \n\nThis story is all about his beard -- or should I say, his terrorist beard!  Baderkhan knows the risks of traveling while having this prominent beard, along with his Iraqi passport, and as a result, he often gets interrogated by immigration officers. \n\nSo why doesn't he just shave his beard and avoid the hassle when traveling?   Watch this video and he will answer the question!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more stories from every country in the world, and join me on Instagram for live updates! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky.

I'm back in Iraqi Kurdistan with my friend Baderkhan - remember him? The guy who has been to 70+ countries with the World's Worst Passport (Iraq)?\n\nI decided to make a sequel about his life because he is a such a good guy and has so many inspiring viewpoints and perspectives. \n\nThis story is all about his beard -- or should I say, his terrorist beard!  Baderkhan knows the risks of traveling while having this prominent beard, along with his Iraqi passport, and as a result, he often gets interrogated by immigration officers. \n\nSo why doesn't he just shave his beard and avoid the hassle when traveling?   Watch this video and he will answer the question!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more stories from every country in the world, and join me on Instagram for live updates! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky.

And every single word in the Turkish language can be translated into these unique sounds?\n\nI recently visited Kuskoy and was completely blown away by how cool and unique this vernacular is!   You really have to hear it to believe it. \n\nAs the locals told me, this whistle language was invented around 500 years ago by local farmers, who needed to communicate with their peers over the steep hills...  Amazingly, the whistles can be heard up to 3 kilometers away!!\n\nShare this video with your friends if you enjoyed!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more travel stories from every country in the world, and join me on Instagram: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Turkey #Travel\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baINSTA: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25baTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

And every single word in the Turkish language can be translated into these unique sounds?\n\nI recently visited Kuskoy and was completely blown away by how cool and unique this vernacular is!   You really have to hear it to believe it. \n\nAs the locals told me, this whistle language was invented around 500 years ago by local farmers, who needed to communicate with their peers over the steep hills...  Amazingly, the whistles can be heard up to 3 kilometers away!!\n\nShare this video with your friends if you enjoyed!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky for more travel stories from every country in the world, and join me on Instagram: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Turkey #Travel\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baINSTA: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25baTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

It contains everything I love about the world -- amazing hospitality, delicious food, mind-blowing history and beautiful ancient wonders. \n\nMy friend Anil and I have been exploring the ins and outs of Antakya and the Hatay province, which reminds me a lot of Syria given it's close proximity. \n\nSome of you guys may remember that about 10 months ago, I spent 2 incredible weeks in Syria -- and considering that the border is just a 1 hour drive away, I had to spontaneously go there and see what I could discover.  My curiosity led the way. \n\nIt ended up being a really special experience to spend time in the border town of Yayladagi, where I was fascinated at the mix of Turkish/Syrian culture.    \n\nHere is the full story from today, I hope you enjoy!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more stories from every country in the world: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Syria #Turkey\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

It contains everything I love about the world -- amazing hospitality, delicious food, mind-blowing history and beautiful ancient wonders. \n\nMy friend Anil and I have been exploring the ins and outs of Antakya and the Hatay province, which reminds me a lot of Syria given it's close proximity. \n\nSome of you guys may remember that about 10 months ago, I spent 2 incredible weeks in Syria -- and considering that the border is just a 1 hour drive away, I had to spontaneously go there and see what I could discover.  My curiosity led the way. \n\nIt ended up being a really special experience to spend time in the border town of Yayladagi, where I was fascinated at the mix of Turkish/Syrian culture.    \n\nHere is the full story from today, I hope you enjoy!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more stories from every country in the world: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Syria #Turkey\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

Despite the fact that it's 47C outside (117F), it's SO AMAZING here because we are right on the Nile and everything is incredibly peaceful.\n\nAs we took a morning boat ride across the Nile, I noticed a really unique village on the shore, consisting of a bunch of blue and white circular buildings.  We spontaneously stopped, checked out the village, and I realized that it's home to the NUBIAN TRIBE (which if you can remember from my videos in Sudan last year, it's the same people!).\n\nThis story is all about the Nubian way of life (yes, they really have crocodiles in their living room). I hope you enjoy!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky for more travel stories from every country in the world.  https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Egypt #Travel\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baINSTA: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25baTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Despite the fact that it's 47C outside (117F), it's SO AMAZING here because we are right on the Nile and everything is incredibly peaceful.\n\nAs we took a morning boat ride across the Nile, I noticed a really unique village on the shore, consisting of a bunch of blue and white circular buildings.  We spontaneously stopped, checked out the village, and I realized that it's home to the NUBIAN TRIBE (which if you can remember from my videos in Sudan last year, it's the same people!).\n\nThis story is all about the Nubian way of life (yes, they really have crocodiles in their living room). I hope you enjoy!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky for more travel stories from every country in the world.  https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Egypt #Travel\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baINSTA: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25baTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

The world has changed drastically since then, especially among airports and airplanes.\n\nA few days ago, I flew from Miami - Istanbul - Cairo and documented every step of the process, so you guys can know what it\u2019s actually like to travel overseas during the pandemic. \n\nI do not recommend traveling right now for leisure, or if you do not feel comfortable. I am traveling solely for work purposes, and taking every precaution that I can. I hope this video will give you guys some real insight as to what travel life looks like these days. \n\nHave you been on a plane since the virus took over the world?

The world has changed drastically since then, especially among airports and airplanes.\n\nA few days ago, I flew from Miami - Istanbul - Cairo and documented every step of the process, so you guys can know what it\u2019s actually like to travel overseas during the pandemic. \n\nI do not recommend traveling right now for leisure, or if you do not feel comfortable. I am traveling solely for work purposes, and taking every precaution that I can. I hope this video will give you guys some real insight as to what travel life looks like these days. \n\nHave you been on a plane since the virus took over the world? If not, when would you feel comfortable to fly again?

Here in Chiapas -- the Southernmost and poorest state of Mexico, the people drink on average 2.2 liters of Coca-Cola PER DAY.   That is more than any country in the WORLD per capita. \n\nIn a state where there are massive shortages of both running/drinking water -- Coca-Cola is found in abundance and it's THE beverage of choice.   I'm telling you that it's seen everywhere, from popular restaurants to rural villages and small shops.  \n\nBut the most surprising thing to me was when I learned that Coca-Cola is viewed as spiritual to the Tzotzil indigenous people in Chiapas.  In a town called San Juan Chamula, coca-cola is deeply intertwined with their culture. It's used as an offering in their main place of worship.   They believe that coke can heal the sick, proving to be one of the most interesting rituals I've ever seen. \n\nAs a result of all of this binge coke drinking, it's no surprise that diabetes is a becoming a huge problem and it's responsible for 3,000 death per year. \n\nI love Mexico so much, but this is an issue that I couldn't let slide.  Would love to get your thoughts on it. \n\nMore travel stories on: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\n#DrewBinsky #CocaCola #Mexico\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baINSTA: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25baTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Here in Chiapas -- the Southernmost and poorest state of Mexico, the people drink on average 2.2 liters of Coca-Cola PER DAY.   That is more than any country in the WORLD per capita. \n\nIn a state where there are massive shortages of both running/drinking water -- Coca-Cola is found in abundance and it's THE beverage of choice.   I'm telling you that it's seen everywhere, from popular restaurants to rural villages and small shops.  \n\nBut the most surprising thing to me was when I learned that Coca-Cola is viewed as spiritual to the Tzotzil indigenous people in Chiapas.  In a town called San Juan Chamula, coca-cola is deeply intertwined with their culture. It's used as an offering in their main place of worship.   They believe that coke can heal the sick, proving to be one of the most interesting rituals I've ever seen. \n\nAs a result of all of this binge coke drinking, it's no surprise that diabetes is a becoming a huge problem and it's responsible for 3,000 death per year. \n\nI love Mexico so much, but this is an issue that I couldn't let slide.  Would love to get your thoughts on it. \n\nMore travel stories on: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\n#DrewBinsky #CocaCola #Mexico\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baINSTA: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25baTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

I've been on such a high over the last 24 hours as I've been editing this video nonstop, and I think you will really enjoy it. \n\nThere are less than 1,000 Lacandones remaining in 4 separate villages, all of which are deep in the Lacandon jungle in the state of Chiapas - about 10 miles from the Guatemalan border.   \n\nThey dress themselves in white as a symbol of peace, grow their hair out as long as possible and speak one of the world's most unique languages called Hach t\u02bcan.\n\nThe Lacandons aren't always open to visitors, by my friend Diego and I were able to get special permission to observe their fascinating culture. \n\nThis is the 5th tribe I've spent quality time with around the world and it's something I really love doing.  It's like hitting the 'refresh' button on life.  It allows me to see a different perspective on our existence and have a new appreciation for our beautiful planet. \n\nThanks as always for watching!

I've been on such a high over the last 24 hours as I've been editing this video nonstop, and I think you will really enjoy it. \n\nThere are less than 1,000 Lacandones remaining in 4 separate villages, all of which are deep in the Lacandon jungle in the state of Chiapas - about 10 miles from the Guatemalan border.   \n\nThey dress themselves in white as a symbol of peace, grow their hair out as long as possible and speak one of the world's most unique languages called Hach t\u02bcan.\n\nThe Lacandons aren't always open to visitors, by my friend Diego and I were able to get special permission to observe their fascinating culture. \n\nThis is the 5th tribe I've spent quality time with around the world and it's something I really love doing.  It's like hitting the 'refresh' button on life.  It allows me to see a different perspective on our existence and have a new appreciation for our beautiful planet. \n\nThanks as always for watching!

Against all odds, he got a degree from a top university and went on to teach himself how to bartend (which was not easy to do in Mexico).  \n\nNow, he has been to 31 countries and over 50 cities to bartend for people around the world and he's only getting started!  What an incredible guy and he is proof that anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

I decided to come here to see what it's all about, and I'm truly blown away by how awesome it is!\n\nGuadalajara is the capital of the state of Jalisco, which is the origin of Mexico\u2019s greatest traditions and products such as tequila, cowboys, cholula sauce, Santana and of course, mariachis.   In my opinion, this could be the best place to visit in the entire country. \n\nJoin me in today's adventure around Guadalajara which was shot entirely on my Panasonic LUMIX G100!

I decided to come here to see what it's all about, and I'm truly blown away by how awesome it is!\n\nGuadalajara is the capital of the state of Jalisco, which is the origin of Mexico\u2019s greatest traditions and products such as tequila, cowboys, cholula sauce, Santana and of course, mariachis.   In my opinion, this could be the best place to visit in the entire country. \n\nJoin me in today's adventure around Guadalajara which was shot entirely on my Panasonic LUMIX G100!  They contacted me and wanted me to test out this brand new vlogging camera, which is the best of its kind on the market.

Then the Spanish came along and discovered silver in the early 16th Century, and they started commercial mining in the area and built an amazing church in 1758 which still stands today.

If you haven't heard of her already, I know you will find her story extremely inspiring! \n\nHalima was born in a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya, because her family was forced to to flee Somalia due to the civil war in the early 1990s.  When she was 7 years old, her family migrated to the USA (Minnesota) where she found herself in a culture shock and couldn't speak English... But that never stopped her from finding her voice! \n\nFast forward 11 years and not only did she become a semi-finalist at Miss Minnesota USA, but she was the FIRST PERSON in their 65 year history to wear a hijab and burkini on stage.  It wasn't intentional, it was just Halima staying true to herself and her beliefs -- but it essentially got the attention of the world and now she has been on the cover of Vogue Magazine, Allure, highlighted in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition among dozens of others.  She travels all over the world doing photoshoots, being a UNICEF ambassador and collaborating with brands that she loves.   And the craziest part? She is only 22 years old! \n\n\nThe sky is the limit for Halima as she continues to be a leader and role model for people in her community, and I can't wait to see what's next!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more inspiring stories like this one! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#HalimaAden #Somalia #Beauty\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

If you haven't heard of her already, I know you will find her story extremely inspiring! \n\nHalima was born in a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya, because her family was forced to to flee Somalia due to the civil war in the early 1990s.  When she was 7 years old, her family migrated to the USA (Minnesota) where she found herself in a culture shock and couldn't speak English... But that never stopped her from finding her voice! \n\nFast forward 11 years and not only did she become a semi-finalist at Miss Minnesota USA, but she was the FIRST PERSON in their 65 year history to wear a hijab and burkini on stage.  It wasn't intentional, it was just Halima staying true to herself and her beliefs -- but it essentially got the attention of the world and now she has been on the cover of Vogue Magazine, Allure, highlighted in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition among dozens of others.  She travels all over the world doing photoshoots, being a UNICEF ambassador and collaborating with brands that she loves.   And the craziest part? She is only 22 years old! \n\n\nThe sky is the limit for Halima as she continues to be a leader and role model for people in her community, and I can't wait to see what's next!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more inspiring stories like this one! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#HalimaAden #Somalia #Beauty\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

It's considered as the world's newest major religion, and it's absolutely fascinating to learn about. \n\nI actually first heard about the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith 5 years ago when I stumbled upon a beautiful Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed temple in Delhi, India -- and over the years as I've met more Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, I've become intrigued by their beliefs and way of life. \n\nIn today's video, you will learn all about the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith through exclusive interviews with Rainn Wilson, Steve Sarowitz and Radiance Talley -- three amazing Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds who I've really enjoyed speaking with. \n\nJust out of curiosity - how many of you guys have heard about the  Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith before this video?  Do any of you guys agree with their beliefs?

It's considered as the world's newest major religion, and it's absolutely fascinating to learn about. \n\nI actually first heard about the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith 5 years ago when I stumbled upon a beautiful Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed temple in Delhi, India -- and over the years as I've met more Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, I've become intrigued by their beliefs and way of life. \n\nIn today's video, you will learn all about the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith through exclusive interviews with Rainn Wilson, Steve Sarowitz and Radiance Talley -- three amazing Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds who I've really enjoyed speaking with. \n\nJust out of curiosity - how many of you guys have heard about the  Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith before this video?

Please excuse the fast paced editing and shaky camera -- I was a newbie back then**\n\nHELLO FROM THE SOUTHERN END OF THE WORLD -- Cape Horn, Chile!\n\nCape Horn is the second-to-last stop on our Hurtigruten Expedition (I really don't want this trip to end!). It's the Southernmost point in South America, and the place where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet.\n\nCape Horn is widely considered to have the most dangerous seas for sailors to cross, as thousands of lives have been taken since it was first discovered in 1616 by Dutch explorers. The hazardous year-round weather produces strong ocean currents, gale force winds and massive waves... Not to mention, the remoteness of these islands, far away from any civilization, make it very difficult to escape or call for help in an emergency situation.\n\nMost attempted landings to Cape Horn have failed because of the wind & rain, but today we got EXTREMELY lucky with sunshine and moderate winds. I was told that this day is 1 in 100 by some of our crew members who have been to Cape Horn dozens of times.\n\nHave you ever heard about Cape Horn? It's a great place to add to your bucket list! Also Chile is awesome!\n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod\n\n#Chile #DrewBinsky #Travel\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

Please excuse the fast paced editing and shaky camera -- I was a newbie back then**\n\nHELLO FROM THE SOUTHERN END OF THE WORLD -- Cape Horn, Chile!\n\nCape Horn is the second-to-last stop on our Hurtigruten Expedition (I really don't want this trip to end!). It's the Southernmost point in South America, and the place where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet.\n\nCape Horn is widely considered to have the most dangerous seas for sailors to cross, as thousands of lives have been taken since it was first discovered in 1616 by Dutch explorers. The hazardous year-round weather produces strong ocean currents, gale force winds and massive waves... Not to mention, the remoteness of these islands, far away from any civilization, make it very difficult to escape or call for help in an emergency situation.\n\nMost attempted landings to Cape Horn have failed because of the wind & rain, but today we got EXTREMELY lucky with sunshine and moderate winds. I was told that this day is 1 in 100 by some of our crew members who have been to Cape Horn dozens of times.\n\nHave you ever heard about Cape Horn? It's a great place to add to your bucket list! Also Chile is awesome!\n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod\n\n#Chile #DrewBinsky #Travel\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

In the Philippines, Jollibee is way more popular than McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendys or any other fast food chain you can think of.  They have the strangest menu items, such as a sweet spaghetti with red hot dogs and a pineapple burger, but I will have to admit that Jollibee hits the spot every time.  It's on every corner in the Philippines (and in over 30 countries around the world).

Please excuse the fast paced editing and shaky camera -- I was a newbie back then**\n\nHAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF JOLLIBEE, or seen the dazzling red bee mascot in your country?\n\nIf not, then find out why Filipinos are going ABSOLUTELY CRAZY over this unique fast-food chain.  In the Philippines, Jollibee is way more popular than McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendys or any other fast food chain you can think of.  They have the strangest menu items, such as a sweet spaghetti with red hot dogs and a pineapple burger, but I will have to admit that Jollibee hits the spot every time.  It's on every corner in the Philippines (and in over 30 countries around the world).  You have to give it a try if you ever pass by one! \n\nMusic: Ben Sound\n\n#DrewBinsky #Jollibee #Philippines\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

I didn't mention in the video, but he has visited over 100 countries -- and you won't believe some of the touching stories he has to tell.  \n\nI've always said that 99.9% of the people in the world are kind and hospitable, and Leon's adventures are a strong testament that this is true.  I can't wait to meet Leon again and travel with him sometime in the near future -- we will make a great team, don't you think?!\n\nShare this story with your friends if you find it inspiring!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more travel stories like this one: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky. \n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

I didn't mention in the video, but he has visited over 100 countries -- and you won't believe some of the touching stories he has to tell.  \n\nI've always said that 99.9% of the people in the world are kind and hospitable, and Leon's adventures are a strong testament that this is true.  I can't wait to meet Leon again and travel with him sometime in the near future -- we will make a great team, don't you think?!\n\nShare this story with your friends if you find it inspiring!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more travel stories like this one: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky. \n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

I was supposed to be in Palau in this very moment.\n\nWell, clearly, that isn't happening... yet.  I'm stuck right now in L.A. and I have no idea when I'll be on the road again.  That is a very scary sentence to say. \n\nIn today's video, I set down my camera and spoke my thoughts for 9 minutes straight.  \n\nThank you in advance for the birthday wishes, and more importantly, I want to thank YOU for all of your support over the years.  Without you guys, I would probably be working a 9-5 somewhere and even more depressed with life at the moment.  \n\nWe will get through this mess.  It will end.  Life, as we knew it, will return.  We must keep these positive thoughts and affirmations going in our heads.    \n\nThanks for listening.  Wash your hands.  Stay 6 feet apart. Love you all and have a great day!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram more (happier) travel stories: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Birthday #Travel\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

I was supposed to be in Palau in this very moment.\n\nWell, clearly, that isn't happening... yet.  I'm stuck right now in L.A. and I have no idea when I'll be on the road again.  That is a very scary sentence to say. \n\nIn today's video, I set down my camera and spoke my thoughts for 9 minutes straight.  \n\nThank you in advance for the birthday wishes, and more importantly, I want to thank YOU for all of your support over the years.  Without you guys, I would probably be working a 9-5 somewhere and even more depressed with life at the moment.  \n\nWe will get through this mess.  It will end.  Life, as we knew it, will return.  We must keep these positive thoughts and affirmations going in our heads.    \n\nThanks for listening.  Wash your hands.  Stay 6 feet apart. Love you all and have a great day!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram more (happier) travel stories: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Birthday #Travel\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

After all, the world about 26% of the world is Muslim, so if you are going to every country, then you will spend your fair share being immersed in the religion. \n\nIn today's video, I want to bring back 3 special stories about Islam that I've discovered on my travels.  The first one is about how my friend Sal, who I recently met in Senegal, reverted to Islam -- the second one is about spending Ramadan in the Maldives -- and the third is about how converting to Islam saved a young French girl named Justine.\n\nDoes Islam play a role in your life?  If so, I'd love to hear it in the comments below!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky Instagram for more travel stories like this one! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#Muslim #Islam #DrewBinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

After all, the world about 26% of the world is Muslim, so if you are going to every country, then you will spend your fair share being immersed in the religion. \n\nIn today's video, I want to bring back 3 special stories about Islam that I've discovered on my travels.  The first one is about how my friend Sal, who I recently met in Senegal, reverted to Islam -- the second one is about spending Ramadan in the Maldives -- and the third is about how converting to Islam saved a young French girl named Justine.\n\nDoes Islam play a role in your life?  If so, I'd love to hear it in the comments below!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky Instagram for more travel stories like this one! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#Muslim #Islam #DrewBinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

His name is Bartolo, AKA the Tree House Dude, because he made his childhood dreams come true by building the most epic Tree House Village in the middle of the jungle.   You have to see it to believe it!\n\nIt wasn't always easy for Bartolo, as he grew up in a very poor household in Boise, Idaho.  To pay for his college, which took him 13 years to complete, he was scrubbing toilets and running a commercial cleaning company...  Then when he graduated, he went on vacation in the Dominican Republic, where he found his \"true calling\" as he says, and he has never left since then. \n\nHere is the full story of Bartolo.  If you ever go to the Dominican Republic, then do me a favor and stay at the Dominican Tree House Village!\n\nSpecial thanks to \"That Jungle Life\" for the extra footage.\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more stories like this: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

His name is Bartolo, AKA the Tree House Dude, because he made his childhood dreams come true by building the most epic Tree House Village in the middle of the jungle.   You have to see it to believe it!\n\nIt wasn't always easy for Bartolo, as he grew up in a very poor household in Boise, Idaho.  To pay for his college, which took him 13 years to complete, he was scrubbing toilets and running a commercial cleaning company...  Then when he graduated, he went on vacation in the Dominican Republic, where he found his \"true calling\" as he says, and he has never left since then. \n\nHere is the full story of Bartolo.  If you ever go to the Dominican Republic, then do me a favor and stay at the Dominican Tree House Village!\n\nSpecial thanks to \"That Jungle Life\" for the extra footage.\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more stories like this: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

                "description": "ANNOUNCEMENT!! \n\nI am thrilled to tell you that I will be making a 90 minute documentary called BORDER 197,  which will be filmed from May 15 to mid-July during my final 6 countries of Palau, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Ecuador, Venezuela and Jamaica.  \n\nThis is a project that I've been wanting to create for 4 years, since I knew I was going to every country, and after pitching it around to some of the best documentary filmmakers, I teamed up with an awesome guy named Chris Wedding.  He and another top-line cinematographer will be traveling with me as become one of the youngest people in history to visit every country.  \n\nThis documentary will NOT be anything like my daily travel videos, nor a compilation of my travels.  You've already seen that through my videos. \n\nInstead, the film will take you behind the scenes of what it's really like to visit every country.  It will be personal.  You will hear from my family and close friends.   It will discuss things that I don't ever tell you, like my severe anxiety.  It will reflect on my biggest realizations/takeaways from crossing 197 borders.  We will discuss how dedicated I am to work 15 hour days, 7 days a week for 3 straight years to create these videos, which have amassed 1.2 billion views.  We will talk about how social media has not only allowed me to finance my trips, but it has let me connect with amazing locals (YOU GUYS) -- and how I rely on their generosity to introduce me to their homeland.  We will dive deep into this 'every country' culture, as there are only ~ 200 people who have done it.  And TONS more!\n\nIf you want to stay up to date on our project, please follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinskydocumentary\n\nChris will be sharing a lot of BTS on his Instagram as well: www.instagram.com/look_see_do\n\nI will be investing a lot of my time, energy and money into this project throughout 2020, and I couldn't be more excited to share it with you!\n\nTHANK YOU!!\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

                    "description": "ANNOUNCEMENT!! \n\nI am thrilled to tell you that I will be making a 90 minute documentary called BORDER 197,  which will be filmed from May 15 to mid-July during my final 6 countries of Palau, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Ecuador, Venezuela and Jamaica.  \n\nThis is a project that I've been wanting to create for 4 years, since I knew I was going to every country, and after pitching it around to some of the best documentary filmmakers, I teamed up with an awesome guy named Chris Wedding.  He and another top-line cinematographer will be traveling with me as become one of the youngest people in history to visit every country.  \n\nThis documentary will NOT be anything like my daily travel videos, nor a compilation of my travels.  You've already seen that through my videos. \n\nInstead, the film will take you behind the scenes of what it's really like to visit every country.  It will be personal.  You will hear from my family and close friends.   It will discuss things that I don't ever tell you, like my severe anxiety.  It will reflect on my biggest realizations/takeaways from crossing 197 borders.  We will discuss how dedicated I am to work 15 hour days, 7 days a week for 3 straight years to create these videos, which have amassed 1.2 billion views.  We will talk about how social media has not only allowed me to finance my trips, but it has let me connect with amazing locals (YOU GUYS) -- and how I rely on their generosity to introduce me to their homeland.  We will dive deep into this 'every country' culture, as there are only ~ 200 people who have done it.  And TONS more!\n\nIf you want to stay up to date on our project, please follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinskydocumentary\n\nChris will be sharing a lot of BTS on his Instagram as well: www.instagram.com/look_see_do\n\nI will be investing a lot of my time, energy and money into this project throughout 2020, and I couldn't be more excited to share it with you!\n\nTHANK YOU!!\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

What does this mean?  It means that she gets free accommodation and gets to bond with the cutest pets, while having the ability to discover new cities around the world.  She's already been to Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and next is Malaysia -- and because she works online, her office can be from anywhere! Sounds like a dream life, right?  \n\nI got connected with Vanessa last week after she contacted me on TrustedHousesitters before Deanna and I went to Myanmar for Valentine's Day.  We needed someone to watch our baby pug, Dudoy, and she was the very first person to reach out.  \n\nWe are just blown away by how incredible the experiences has been, as well as how amazing Vanessa's life is!   We felt very comfortable knowing that she was in our apartment and caring for our baby pug.  It was a win-win for everyone involved, with no money exchange.  We benefited from someone incredible watching our dog, and she benefited from getting a free place to stay and enjoying Dudoy's company. \n\nThank you TrustedHousesitters for helping making this video happen (sponsored), and I highly suggest you guys to get involved whether you're a pet-loving traveler or a pet-owner.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nThe most popular question I get is how, \"Drew, How can you afford to travel?\" --  so in this video, I give you a complete breakdown of how I've made money to afford my trips to 189 countries. \n\nNo, I am not rich and no, I don't take money from my parents.  \n\nI pay for all of my travel expenses out of money that I earned from hard work, and it has involved A LOT of pivoting to whatever is currently working out for me at the time  (teaching English -- travel blogging -- Snapchat -- Instagram -- Video making  -- ???)\n\nIn the second half of this video, I give you tons of tips and advice for how YOU can find jobs abroad (or remotely) to essentially travel for free. If you have any to add, please comment them below! \n\nThis is meant to be an inspirational video, so I hope it triggers some of you to realize how many opportunities are out there because YOU CAN do this too, if you choose!   All you need is a wifi signal, a computer and a little bit of courage :)\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for more! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky \n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nThe most popular question I get is how, \"Drew, How can you afford to travel?\" --  so in this video, I give you a complete breakdown of how I've made money to afford my trips to 189 countries. \n\nNo, I am not rich and no, I don't take money from my parents.  \n\nI pay for all of my travel expenses out of money that I earned from hard work, and it has involved A LOT of pivoting to whatever is currently working out for me at the time  (teaching English -- travel blogging -- Snapchat -- Instagram -- Video making  -- ???)\n\nIn the second half of this video, I give you tons of tips and advice for how YOU can find jobs abroad (or remotely) to essentially travel for free. If you have any to add, please comment them below! \n\nThis is meant to be an inspirational video, so I hope it triggers some of you to realize how many opportunities are out there because YOU CAN do this too, if you choose!   All you need is a wifi signal, a computer and a little bit of courage :)\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for more! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky \n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

I DO NOT hate these countries -- in fact, it's just the opposite.   When you travel to every country in the world, you're often going to be put in situations like these, and I feel like it's appropriate to share them with you. \n\nWhat's your scariest travel story?

I want you to meet my good friend Natalie, who is the founder of an education movement called OWN Academy \u81ea\u7531\u5b78\u5712.\n\nI met Natalie a few years ago in Hong Kong (remember that $100 video I made there?) and we've remained great friends ever since.  One thing that we both have in common is our love for PAKISTAN!\n\nIn Natalie's case, it was her trip to Pakistan which inspired her to become the leader that she is today.   She fell in love with Pakistani culture so much that every day for the last 5 years, she has dressed herself in traditional Pakistani attire (called kurtas). \n\nThere's so many more things to say about Natalie's story and her as a person in real life, so I hope you enjoy this video!     \n\nAnyone else inspired by Pakistan?

Why do I love Muslim people and culture so much?   I answer both of these questions in this video!\n\nAnyone else out there feel the same way I do about Muslim people and Islam in general?

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nToday I have the pleasure of introducing you to Bashir Osman, who in my opinion, is THE man of Mogadishu.  He is the owner of the hotel I am staying at, called Peace Hotel, and the reason why I find his story to be so inspiring is because he has never left his home to live elsewhere. \n\nAs you probably already know, Mogadishu has been in a constant state of civil war since 1991, and many Somalis have left for a safer life abroad. But not Bashir.  He has toughed out the most dangerous days in Mogadishu, and is very optimistic what the future brings to his city. \n\nThis is my last video in Mogadishu, and I would like to say on a personal note that this has been an incredible trip and I will certainly be coming back here very soon.  The people that I've met over the last 4 days -- every single one of them -- was so friendly and welcoming to me and I have nothing but good things to say in the future.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25ba Lee's Insta: https://www.instagram.com/leeabbamonte/\n\nThis is the inspiring story of my great friend Lee Abbamonte, who has just flown out from NYC to meet me here in Ethiopia.  We are heading to Somalia, next!\n\nLee is one of the world's most traveled people.  He has been to every U.N. member state, U.S. state, U.S. national park, both the North and South poles, and 321 unique territories overall.  \n\nHe finished all of the countries in 2011, about 9 years before I will do it, and those 9 years made a lot of difference in terms of how we each approached this mission.  In short, Lee wasn't able to leverage social media to lower his travel costs and get paid to travel...  because it wasn't popular back then.  Instead, he had to work and save his own money the old fashioned way -- making the journey significantly more expensive than what it's costing me.    He actually started his travels before the internet took off, back in 1998!\n\nI hope you enjoy hearing Lee's story as he's a great friend and mentor.  We are both about to go on one of the craziest trips of our lives to Mogadishu, Somalia tomorrow -- so stay tuned!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for more! https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nLee's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/leeabbamonte/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25ba Lee's Insta: https://www.instagram.com/leeabbamonte/\n\nThis is the inspiring story of my great friend Lee Abbamonte, who has just flown out from NYC to meet me here in Ethiopia.  We are heading to Somalia, next!\n\nLee is one of the world's most traveled people.  He has been to every U.N. member state, U.S. state, U.S. national park, both the North and South poles, and 321 unique territories overall.  \n\nHe finished all of the countries in 2011, about 9 years before I will do it, and those 9 years made a lot of difference in terms of how we each approached this mission.  In short, Lee wasn't able to leverage social media to lower his travel costs and get paid to travel...  because it wasn't popular back then.  Instead, he had to work and save his own money the old fashioned way -- making the journey significantly more expensive than what it's costing me.    He actually started his travels before the internet took off, back in 1998!\n\nI hope you enjoy hearing Lee's story as he's a great friend and mentor.  We are both about to go on one of the craziest trips of our lives to Mogadishu, Somalia tomorrow -- so stay tuned!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for more! https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nLee's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/leeabbamonte/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Also within the year, Deanna and I got a pug, moved back to Manila, and are really happy with everything!\n\nThank you to all my friends out there -- both old and new -- who have joined me on this wild ride to every country in the world.  This journey (to every country) will end in July 2020, but there will be a much better chapter that follows  -- trust me on that! \n\nHope you all have a wonderful new years, wherever you may be celebrating in the world!

Also within the year, Deanna and I got a pug, moved back to Manila, and are really happy with everything!\n\nThank you to all my friends out there -- both old and new -- who have joined me on this wild ride to every country in the world.  This journey (to every country) will end in July 2020, but there will be a much better chapter that follows  -- trust me on that! \n\nHope you all have a wonderful new years, wherever you may be celebrating in the world!

I just attended a local wedding in the Democratic Republic of Congo \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde9 It was fascinating to observe how the Congolese celebrate marriage -- there is no shortage of dancing, eating and smiling faces all around.\n\nAt first I was (very) intimidated being the only foreigner out of some 800 people in attendance, but they all welcomed me in with open arms and it turned out to be just fine. \n\nHave you ever attended a wedding in a foreign country?

I just attended a local wedding in the Democratic Republic of Congo \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde9 It was fascinating to observe how the Congolese celebrate marriage -- there is no shortage of dancing, eating and smiling faces all around.\n\nAt first I was (very) intimidated being the only foreigner out of some 800 people in attendance, but they all welcomed me in with open arms and it turned out to be just fine. \n\nHave you ever attended a wedding in a foreign country?  It might be the best way to experience any given culture on earth! \n\nFollow me @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES!

If you can remember about 2 years ago, I did something similar in Uganda, but to be honest, it's 10X better in the DRC because we were the only ones here in this remote setting.   I just can\u2019t believe how human-like they are!\n\nIn other positive news, the world population of mountain gorillas has risen from about 600 to over 1,000 in the last decade, moving them from \"critically endangered\" to just \"endangered.\" \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for more: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nP.S.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nOn the streets of Tripoli, Libya, I met a wonderful lady named Hadia who has a really inspiring story to share.\n\nShe's an entrepreneur, an artist, a teacher, a problem solver (among many others)  -- but the most encouraging thing about her story is how she is able to make everyone around her stay positive as Libya has been undergoing a tough state of war and instability.   \n\nI was invited to her house/workshop today on the outskirts of Tripoli, where the majority of this video was shot.  It has been great getting a glimpse of her life and seeing how she is making an impact on Libyan society. \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for more: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nOn the streets of Tripoli, Libya, I met a wonderful lady named Hadia who has a really inspiring story to share.\n\nShe's an entrepreneur, an artist, a teacher, a problem solver (among many others)  -- but the most encouraging thing about her story is how she is able to make everyone around her stay positive as Libya has been undergoing a tough state of war and instability.   \n\nI was invited to her house/workshop today on the outskirts of Tripoli, where the majority of this video was shot.  It has been great getting a glimpse of her life and seeing how she is making an impact on Libyan society. \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for more: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nYesterday, I was invited into a Syrian home which turned out to be THE BEST HOME COOKED MEAL that I've had in a loooong long time.   \n\nThe dish they made me is called kibbeh, and I think it's now my #1 favorite dish in the Middle East (behind shawarma and manaeesh).\n\nI spent 5 hours with this amazing family as we went to the market to get the ingredients, then cooked in the kitchen and ate together outside on a big table.   \n\nThis video was spontaneous.  I had no idea what would unfold when I knocked on their door.  Maybe it was going to be an awkward day with little conversation?  Maybe the food wouldn't be tasty?  ... But turns out that it was one of the most memorable experiences in recent memory, and I hope you enjoy this special taste of Syrian food and hospitality!\n\nIs it obvious to you yet that I am loving this country?!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories to see daily life unfold in Syria behind the scenes!  https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nYesterday, I was invited into a Syrian home which turned out to be THE BEST HOME COOKED MEAL that I've had in a loooong long time.   \n\nThe dish they made me is called kibbeh, and I think it's now my #1 favorite dish in the Middle East (behind shawarma and manaeesh).\n\nI spent 5 hours with this amazing family as we went to the market to get the ingredients, then cooked in the kitchen and ate together outside on a big table.   \n\nThis video was spontaneous.  I had no idea what would unfold when I knocked on their door.  Maybe it was going to be an awkward day with little conversation?  Maybe the food wouldn't be tasty?  ... But turns out that it was one of the most memorable experiences in recent memory, and I hope you enjoy this special taste of Syrian food and hospitality!\n\nIs it obvious to you yet that I am loving this country?!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories to see daily life unfold in Syria behind the scenes!  https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nSyria's capital of Damascus is widely considered as the oldest continuously inhabited city on earth, with evidence of habitation dating back (at least) 11,000 years.  For all you math wizards out there, that's about 10,000 B.C.!\n\nThis is largely due to the unique positioning of the city -- in the heart of the Middle East, in the center of the world and at the intersection of 3 continents.  Damascus was conquered by Alexander the Great in 333 BCE, and since then, it's been taken over by dozens of empires such as Roman, Arab and Ottoman.\n\nI have spent the first few days of my trip in Syria in this amazing city, and I'm loving it so much that I wanted to dedicate an entire video to show you what it's like to visit.  \n\nOne thing that I didn't mention much in the video is about how SAFE it is in Damascus.  I can't speak yet for the rest of Syria, but as far as this city goes (in this current day), I feel extremely safe just like I do in any other big city around the world.  \n\nMORE TO COME SOON! \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for exclusive content that isn't shown in my videos:  \nhttps://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Thus, he's always been someone I looked up to in the travel space.\n\nBut this video is not only about his epic travels around the world -- it explains how he has transformed into a more complete, spiritual and well-rounded person primarily through converting to Islam back in 2013.\n\nJust curious, has anyone else out there converted to Islam?  Or any other religion for that matter? I would love to hear your thoughts! \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for live updates from our trip: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky.\n\nSal also posts super cool videos on his Youtube Channel: https://bit.ly/2POG0lG\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Thus, he's always been someone I looked up to in the travel space.\n\nBut this video is not only about his epic travels around the world -- it explains how he has transformed into a more complete, spiritual and well-rounded person primarily through converting to Islam back in 2013.\n\nJust curious, has anyone else out there converted to Islam?  Or any other religion for that matter? I would love to hear your thoughts! \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for live updates from our trip: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky.\n\nSal also posts super cool videos on his Youtube Channel: https://bit.ly/2POG0lG\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Many of them can carry up to 70% of their body weight, which is nearly impossible to do with just your two hands. \n\nI'm here in Guinea-Bissau, the tiny Portuguese-speaking West African nation, and I wanted to dedicate this video entirely to these strong women who have an impressive sense of balance.  \n\nI tried to walk 5 steps with 30 kilos of rice on my head, and it's a LOT harder than I thought...\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for behind the scenes of my trip in West  Africa: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky \n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nNo matter where you go on the African continent, you can see women carrying heavy loads of goods on the top of their heads and it's fascinating!   Many of them can carry up to 70% of their body weight, which is nearly impossible to do with just your two hands. \n\nI'm here in Guinea-Bissau, the tiny Portuguese-speaking West African nation, and I wanted to dedicate this video entirely to these strong women who have an impressive sense of balance.  \n\nI tried to walk 5 steps with 30 kilos of rice on my head, and it's a LOT harder than I thought...\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for behind the scenes of my trip in West  Africa: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky \n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nAfter a rough few days in Sierra Leone, we have made it onwards to the next West African country of Guinea (Conakry).\n\nIt's been a wild 2.5 days here so far, from the challenging roads to the (once again) disgusting corruption and bribery that we had to deal with.  But we made it, after 11 LONG hours of driving 150 miles, to the capital of Conakry.\n\nInitially, we had a great time exploring the fish market at sunrise and then getting secret access inside the 2nd biggest mosque in sub Saharan Africa -- but then things quickly turned bad when thousands of policemen (armed with AK47s, helmets and bullet proof vests) stormed the streets in preparation for the riots which have been destroying the city.   \n\nWe quickly ran (literally) back to our hotel and called it a day.  We didn't leave the hotel anytime afterwards.  \n\nThis region of the world is tough to travel across, especially in your own vehicle.  At each of the dozens and dozens of police checkpoints, we are always pulled over to show our car papers/insurance, and even after we do correctly, the corrupt police will find ANY reason to pick on us (often times, making up some random law) until we pay them off.  It makes me sad. \n\nBUT I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS (in case you missed yesterday's video)!  THE SIERRA LEONE GOVERNMENT SAW MY VIDEO ABOUT US GETTING SCAMMED AND THEY WENT TO THE BORDER TO ARREST THE 3 GUYS AND NOW THEY ARE IN PRISON!

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nHELLO FROM LAGOS, NIGERIA -- COUNTRY #175!! \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec I truly had a lot of fun making this video inside Africa's craziest and most populated city.  Did you know that over 20 million people are living in Lagos?!   It is hands down one of the most hectic, chaotic and vibrant places I've ever been with a LOT of stories to tell. I'm overwhelmed.\n\nMy local friend and YouTuber named Tayo (his channel linked below) has been taking me all around his bustling city and we've had an absolute blast together.  Surprisingly, this was one of the hardest videos I've ever made because it's REALLY challenging to shoot content on these streets.  People don't like being on the camera here and they make a huge commotion in the streets and ask for money (etc) whenever they see it from a distance.\n\nIn any regard, I hope you enjoy this episode of my $10 series and get a glimpse into local Nigerian culture.  More to come tomorrow!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for live updates from my Africa trip in real time: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nHELLO FROM LAGOS, NIGERIA -- COUNTRY #175!! \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec I truly had a lot of fun making this video inside Africa's craziest and most populated city.  Did you know that over 20 million people are living in Lagos?!   It is hands down one of the most hectic, chaotic and vibrant places I've ever been with a LOT of stories to tell. I'm overwhelmed.\n\nMy local friend and YouTuber named Tayo (his channel linked below) has been taking me all around his bustling city and we've had an absolute blast together.  Surprisingly, this was one of the hardest videos I've ever made because it's REALLY challenging to shoot content on these streets.  People don't like being on the camera here and they make a huge commotion in the streets and ask for money (etc) whenever they see it from a distance.\n\nIn any regard, I hope you enjoy this episode of my $10 series and get a glimpse into local Nigerian culture.  More to come tomorrow!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for live updates from my Africa trip in real time: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Sudan in the north and South Sudan in the South...  They are completely different in every way possible.\n\nI have spent the last 48 hours in Juba, the capital city of South Sudan, and it has been one of the most interesting and eye opening trips of my entire life. \n\nThankfully, was able to get in touch with some awesome locals through social media and they've been showing me around and making sure I'm safe.  I say this because South Sudan is not the safest country around Africa -- it's been in a constant state of war since its existence 8 years ago.  But things now seem to be much more stable than the past, and the future is bright for this oil rich country in Central/East Africa. \n\nIn this video, join me as I give you a deeper look at the people, culture and life of South Sudan.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nHELLO FROM COUNTRY #172 - ERITREA!\n\nI'm thrilled to be back in Africa where I will be spending the remaining 3 months of the year! Many of you probably haven\u2019t heard of Eritrea before and that\u2019s because it\u2019s a relatively new country and it\u2019s notoriously difficult to enter (top 5 in the world).  After 48 hours of roaming around the capital of Asmara and the ancient port city of Massawa, I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time here. \n\nI\u2019m getting flashbacks to when I was in Ethiopia, yet also touches of Yemen Somaliland and Italy. Yes - ITALY! Eritrea is a former Italian colony and their influence is remarkably well-preserved in the form of giant cathedrals, pizza parlors, gelato shops, old Italian cars, appertivos and many people can still speak fluent Italiano. \n\nThe capital of Asmara is VERY safe, with kind hearted people and surprisingly the weather is cold here (2,400 meters high). Unfortunately due to WiFi issues, I haven't been able to upload anything until now, but there\u2019s no hurry, because life is wonderful here! More to come soon \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf7\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky in real-time behind the scenes on Instagram Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nHELLO FROM COUNTRY #172 - ERITREA!\n\nI'm thrilled to be back in Africa where I will be spending the remaining 3 months of the year! Many of you probably haven\u2019t heard of Eritrea before and that\u2019s because it\u2019s a relatively new country and it\u2019s notoriously difficult to enter (top 5 in the world).  After 48 hours of roaming around the capital of Asmara and the ancient port city of Massawa, I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time here. \n\nI\u2019m getting flashbacks to when I was in Ethiopia, yet also touches of Yemen Somaliland and Italy. Yes - ITALY! Eritrea is a former Italian colony and their influence is remarkably well-preserved in the form of giant cathedrals, pizza parlors, gelato shops, old Italian cars, appertivos and many people can still speak fluent Italiano. \n\nThe capital of Asmara is VERY safe, with kind hearted people and surprisingly the weather is cold here (2,400 meters high). Unfortunately due to WiFi issues, I haven't been able to upload anything until now, but there\u2019s no hurry, because life is wonderful here! More to come soon \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf7\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky in real-time behind the scenes on Instagram Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

I'll be up all night reading your comments below. \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG stories for more footage from Hong Kong: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nThank you to Antony Dapiran for the extra footage.  You can follow his Twitter @antd to stay updated on the protests.\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

She went from living in a modern and peaceful country to an impoverished and dangerous one, and it's been very difficult for her to adapt.  \n\nCan you imagine being trapped in Yemen after growing up in an advanced society in Riyadh? As much as she wants to leave to study, she must wait until the situation clears up and the borders/airports reopen.  \n\nThis video also explains her perspective on what needs to be done for Yemen to overcome this disaster and go back to how life used to be 10 years ago.  It's a fascinating interview and I enjoyed hearing her thoughts.  I hope you do too. \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for updates in Yemen in real time: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

She went from living in a modern and peaceful country to an impoverished and dangerous one, and it's been very difficult for her to adapt.  \n\nCan you imagine being trapped in Yemen after growing up in an advanced society in Riyadh? As much as she wants to leave to study, she must wait until the situation clears up and the borders/airports reopen.  \n\nThis video also explains her perspective on what needs to be done for Yemen to overcome this disaster and go back to how life used to be 10 years ago.  It's a fascinating interview and I enjoyed hearing her thoughts.  I hope you do too. \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for updates in Yemen in real time: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nI was lucky enough to get connected with Shrooq through an Instagram friend, and she's welcomed me into her city of Mukalla with nothing but open arms.  It's been fascinating to hear about life in Yemen from her perspective as a female, which actually has its benefits during the current situation.  \n\nShrooq is a young entrepreneur who is fighting for equal rights between men and women.  She's rebellious in the sense of showing her face in public, because 99% of females in her culture cover themselves from head to toe.  \n\nHer and her friends started an activist club which revives local culture in their city for the youth, and it's amazing to see the impacts they're having on society, despite the rough times that they've been through.\n\nIn today's video, join me as I take you inside the captivating life of Shrooq.

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nI was lucky enough to get connected with Shrooq through an Instagram friend, and she's welcomed me into her city of Mukalla with nothing but open arms.  It's been fascinating to hear about life in Yemen from her perspective as a female, which actually has its benefits during the current situation.  \n\nShrooq is a young entrepreneur who is fighting for equal rights between men and women.  She's rebellious in the sense of showing her face in public, because 99% of females in her culture cover themselves from head to toe.  \n\nHer and her friends started an activist club which revives local culture in their city for the youth, and it's amazing to see the impacts they're having on society, despite the rough times that they've been through.\n\nIn today's video, join me as I take you inside the captivating life of Shrooq.

I'm sure you are aware that since 2011, Yemen has been in a constant state of war.  Tourists are not welcome here, and it's extremely risky for any traveler to visit at this moment -- especially as both an American and a journalist. I am double at risk.\n\nThat all being said, I am beyond excited to have this rare opportunity to take you inside one of the most hidden and raw cultures left on earth.  My first 24 hours has already been one hell of an emotional ride (as you'll see in this video) -- and you will be hearing lots more over the coming week. \n\nYou won't want to miss this series, trust me!\n\nIf you're on Instagram, join me on IG Stories for more updates: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

If not, then get ready to learn about how strange it is here in my 170th country. \n\nI've spent the last 24 hours roaming around the capital city of Ashgabat, and IT REMINDS ME EXACTLY OF PYONGYANG, NORTH KOREA in just about every way possible.  Huge fancy buildings with very few people inside perfectly manicured gardens and boulevards with nobody on them and this eerie feeling that someone is watching over my shoulder 24/7. TURKMENISTAN IS WEIRD. \n\nPeople had told me that Ashgabat was strange, but I had no idea to what extent it was until arriving here.... Find out everything you need to know about Turkmenistan's capital in this video!\n\nHow many of you guys actually knew about this place? Would love to see a show of hands :)\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more content! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

If not, then get ready to learn about how strange it is here in my 170th country. \n\nI've spent the last 24 hours roaming around the capital city of Ashgabat, and IT REMINDS ME EXACTLY OF PYONGYANG, NORTH KOREA in just about every way possible.  Huge fancy buildings with very few people inside perfectly manicured gardens and boulevards with nobody on them and this eerie feeling that someone is watching over my shoulder 24/7. TURKMENISTAN IS WEIRD. \n\nPeople had told me that Ashgabat was strange, but I had no idea to what extent it was until arriving here.... Find out everything you need to know about Turkmenistan's capital in this video!\n\nHow many of you guys actually knew about this place? Would love to see a show of hands :)\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more content! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com"

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nThis is the story of a young Spanish girl named Kenya, who is taking a much different approach to getting her college degree.   \n\nInstead of staying on one campus, attending boring lecture halls and taking final exams -- her innovative schooling system, called Minerva, is 100% online and involves debating and learning REAL WORLD tactics.  There are 130 people in her class who come from 65 countries and they are constantly traveling, living in 7 different countries for 4 months at a time.  \n\nI'd love to get your thoughts on whether you think this is the future of education or not?

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nThis is the story of a young Spanish girl named Kenya, who is taking a much different approach to getting her college degree.   \n\nInstead of staying on one campus, attending boring lecture halls and taking final exams -- her innovative schooling system, called Minerva, is 100% online and involves debating and learning REAL WORLD tactics.  There are 130 people in her class who come from 65 countries and they are constantly traveling, living in 7 different countries for 4 months at a time.  \n\nI'd love to get your thoughts on whether you think this is the future of education or not?  I certainly think it is a lot more valuable than the \"traditional colleges\" that we know of today.\n\nAre you on Instagram?

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nI've really been enjoying my time in Madrid over the last week -- it's my first time here!!

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nVietnamese people in Prague?  \n\nDon't get confused by this title, there is actually a massive Vietnamese community in the Czech Republic -- especially right here in Prague!\n\nI remember when I lived in Prague 7 years ago that there was a lot of Vietnamese restaurants, but I never really dug deeper to find out why they were here.  And now, I've realized that many of them came to Czechoslovakia during the communism period to work or study, and then when communism fell in the early 90s, they never left.\n\nHere is the full story of the Vietnamese influence of Prague, which I find to be fascinating and incredible.\n\nThanks for the shots Michael Makes Films.

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nVietnamese people in Prague?  \n\nDon't get confused by this title, there is actually a massive Vietnamese community in the Czech Republic -- especially right here in Prague!\n\nI remember when I lived in Prague 7 years ago that there was a lot of Vietnamese restaurants, but I never really dug deeper to find out why they were here.  And now, I've realized that many of them came to Czechoslovakia during the communism period to work or study, and then when communism fell in the early 90s, they never left.\n\nHere is the full story of the Vietnamese influence of Prague, which I find to be fascinating and incredible.\n\nThanks for the shots Michael Makes Films.

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nIt's time to put Niger on the map!\n\nWhen I arrived in Niger yesterday, my 168th country, I was picked up at the airport by an Instagram friend named Aminata.  \n\nLittle did I know that she'd be one of the coolest people I've ever met in my life!\n\nAfter living in Germany for the last 7 years, she was fed up when people would mistake her for being 'Nigerian' (the English-speaking country next door).  So she recently moved back to her hometown of Niamey, Niger to start an NGO promoting her country's culture and traditions.  In a sense, she is the one and only 'cultural ambassador' for her Niger and she is doing big things like organizing the first international cultural festival in August.\n\nIn our globalized world of fast-paced, cut-throat societies -- it's imperative for us to preserve our beautiful cultures, like Aminata is doing with Niger. \n\nShare this video to help Aminata's goal of putting her country on the map!  I may add, an amazing country that is :)\n\nFollow me on Instagram for more stories! @DrewBinsky.

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nIt's time to put Niger on the map!\n\nWhen I arrived in Niger yesterday, my 168th country, I was picked up at the airport by an Instagram friend named Aminata.  \n\nLittle did I know that she'd be one of the coolest people I've ever met in my life!\n\nAfter living in Germany for the last 7 years, she was fed up when people would mistake her for being 'Nigerian' (the English-speaking country next door).  So she recently moved back to her hometown of Niamey, Niger to start an NGO promoting her country's culture and traditions.  In a sense, she is the one and only 'cultural ambassador' for her Niger and she is doing big things like organizing the first international cultural festival in August.\n\nIn our globalized world of fast-paced, cut-throat societies -- it's imperative for us to preserve our beautiful cultures, like Aminata is doing with Niger. \n\nShare this video to help Aminata's goal of putting her country on the map!  I may add, an amazing country that is :)\n\nFollow me on Instagram for more stories! @DrewBinsky.  And Aminata's Insta is @SensaiCulture\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baTW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com"

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nWHO ARE THE AMISH PEOPLE OF AMERICA?\n\nOne thing I love about the USA is the diversity.  You can pretty much find people from all cultures, religions, traditions and walks of life inside of this country of 327 million people.\n\nOne of the most interesting groups of people that I've come across are the AMISH.   They are traditional Christian Anabaptists who originally have Swiss German roots, and settled (mostly) in Pennsylvania in the early 18th Century.\n\nI went to Lancaster Country, PA today to learn all about their way of life, and it's fascinating!  Have you ever heard of the Amish before?\n\nFollow me on Instagram @DrewBinsky for more travel content.  Huge thank you to Amish Farm and House for taking us around!\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baTW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nWHO ARE THE AMISH PEOPLE OF AMERICA?\n\nOne thing I love about the USA is the diversity.  You can pretty much find people from all cultures, religions, traditions and walks of life inside of this country of 327 million people.\n\nOne of the most interesting groups of people that I've come across are the AMISH.   They are traditional Christian Anabaptists who originally have Swiss German roots, and settled (mostly) in Pennsylvania in the early 18th Century.\n\nI went to Lancaster Country, PA today to learn all about their way of life, and it's fascinating!  Have you ever heard of the Amish before?\n\nFollow me on Instagram @DrewBinsky for more travel content.  Huge thank you to Amish Farm and House for taking us around!\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baTW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com"

Then she illegally entered Thailand without a passport, where she was thrown in jail for 1 month.  After getting in touch with the South Korean embassy, they granted her citizenship and allowed her to move to Seoul.\n\nWhile it was difficult for her to adjust to South Korean culture at first, she now lives a great life as an actress on TV and making videos for her YouTube and Instagram accounts (@kang_naraa)\n\nThis has been a special story for me to create because I spent 4 days in North Korea in 2017 and I got a glance at what society she grew up in...  We chatted about everything from her thoughts on Kim Jong-un to the struggles that she faces adjusting to life in South Korea today.\n\nIf you find Nara's story inspiring - share this video with your friends!\n\nJoin me on Instagram @drewbinsky for more: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Then she illegally entered Thailand without a passport, where she was thrown in jail for 1 month.  After getting in touch with the South Korean embassy, they granted her citizenship and allowed her to move to Seoul.\n\nWhile it was difficult for her to adjust to South Korean culture at first, she now lives a great life as an actress on TV and making videos for her YouTube and Instagram accounts (@kang_naraa)\n\nThis has been a special story for me to create because I spent 4 days in North Korea in 2017 and I got a glance at what society she grew up in...  We chatted about everything from her thoughts on Kim Jong-un to the struggles that she faces adjusting to life in South Korea today.\n\nIf you find Nara's story inspiring - share this video with your friends!\n\nJoin me on Instagram @drewbinsky for more: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nA story about the Yazidis and the genocide of Yazidism by ISIS.\n\nThis is a very sad story, but one that I feel needs to be told because of the lack of international attention that the Yazidi people have received.\n\nIn short, the Yazidis -- who are both an ethnic group and religion -- were targeted and attacked by ISIS in 2014.  On August 3rd of that year, ISIS stormed in one of their beloved towns called Shingal, killing men by the thousands and forcing women into sexual slavery.   And those women who didn't follow their rules (including converting to Islam) were killed.\n\nToday I went to the tiny mountainous village in North Eastern Iraq called Lalish -- which is the site of the holiest temple in Yazidism.  Is it their \"Mecca\" equivalent. In Lalish, it is forbidden to wear shoes to acknowledge the purity of their religion.  \n\nI met some people who survived the genocide and I asked them a few questions.  This is what they have to say.\n\nThis content is not my favorite to make. It's difficult.  It's raw.  It's depressing.

By a long shot!  Pakistan is cheaper than Bangladesh, India, Vietnam and Nepal.\n\nIt's mind-blowing to me how affordable everything is in Pakistan, from hotels to food to taxis to souvenirs.

By a long shot!  Pakistan is cheaper than Bangladesh, India, Vietnam and Nepal.\n\nIt's mind-blowing to me how affordable everything is in Pakistan, from hotels to food to taxis to souvenirs.  Basically for just $20/day, you can live comfortably.  This is just one of the many reasons that makes coming to Pakistan so enjoyable.\n\nWhat do you think is the cheapest country in the world?\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

I'm so happy to be back in my favorite country for the 32nd time -- and we've decided to make a new \"home base\" here for the next 6 weeks!  \n\nI have now visited 161 countries, which means that I have 36 left to complete my lifelong goal of visiting every country in the world.  \n\n2019 will be the year that I (hopefully) get to step foot in my 197th country, but it's going to be a loooong, tedious, and exciting journey to get there. \n\nThis video explains some of the challenges that I will face as I plan to enter some of the most difficult and least visited countries in the world. \n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.

Watch this video!\n\nHi from Samoa -- I am nearing the end of my 3 week trip around the Pacific Islands, and now I have just Tonga and Palau left until I complete them all!\n\nI absolutely love traveling in the Pacific Islands -- from the vibrant culture to the enriching nature and everything in between.   This video contains my 6 favorite things about traveling in the Pacific Islands, as well as some of my best travel tips if you are planning to come here!\n\nPlease comment any questions you have about the Pacific Islands, and I'll get back to you :)\n\nFollow @drewbinsky on IG STORIES for behind-the-scenes of my travels.  36 COUNTRIES LEFT\n\nP.S. I'm quite exhausted from hopping around while making daily videos, so I've decided to take some \"off time\" to chill and enjoy Samoa...  When I say \"time off,\" I mean that I will not be running around all over the place, filming like a mad man.  I will be relaxing.

Watch this video!\n\nHi from Samoa -- I am nearing the end of my 3 week trip around the Pacific Islands, and now I have just Tonga and Palau left until I complete them all!\n\nI absolutely love traveling in the Pacific Islands -- from the vibrant culture to the enriching nature and everything in between.   This video contains my 6 favorite things about traveling in the Pacific Islands, as well as some of my best travel tips if you are planning to come here!\n\nPlease comment any questions you have about the Pacific Islands, and I'll get back to you :)\n\nFollow @drewbinsky on IG STORIES for behind-the-scenes of my travels.  36 COUNTRIES LEFT\n\nP.S. I'm quite exhausted from hopping around while making daily videos, so I've decided to take some \"off time\" to chill and enjoy Samoa...  When I say \"time off,\" I mean that I will not be running around all over the place, filming like a mad man.  I will be relaxing.  But still making videos!\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baIG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baTW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com"

Kava is made from the roots of the kava plant, mixed with hibiscus plant and then squeezed out into a cup.  Kava is one of the most interesting drinks I've ever seen, and I can't wait to tell you all about it in this video!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on legal, 100% natural remedies such as kava?  Would you ever try it?\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

It's projected to be entirely underwater by the year 2100. \n \nWhile many countries are feeling the impacts of climate change, nobody is more threatened right now than the 100,000+ residents of Kiribati.\n\nThe question now becomes, how do we prevent the people here from becoming climate refugees?  The only 4 options I can think of are the following:\n\n1. Build a higher sea wall (which will cost billions of USD)\n2. Buy land overseas for them to relocate (will also cost a fortune)\n3. Send more Kiribati citizens abroad (i.e. Australia and New Zealand) for jobs, and they can slowly adapt to a new life \n4. Boost tourism in Kiribati so people can see first hand the affects of climate change, which will also pump money back in to the economy\n\nWould love to get your thoughts on what we can do to help the wonderful people of Kiribati.  I encourage you all to get creative and share your best solutions below.  I will be reading and responding to as many comments as I can, and I encourage you to do the same.

Meet the traveling Goy's (AKA the Wonderlusters) -- I bumped into them this morning at a temple in Sri Lanka, and after speaking with them for a bit, I decided to make this spontaneous video of their inspiring journey. \n\nLong story short, this family of 4 sold everything back home (Quebec, Canada) to go on a 15 MONTH trip to 50 COUNTRIES for LESS THAN $70,000 USD TOTAL. \n\nI caught them half way on their journey, and I was very impressed to hear about their adventures. I know how tedious it is to plan long trips (as a solo traveler), and I could not imagine doing it for 4 people... not to mention, the patience they have to constantly watch over a 9 and 7 year old!\n\nThe Goy's use all sorts of travel hacks to minimize their expenses (i.e. 16 credit cards to collect points) and they homeschool their youngsters on the road.   If you ask me, no kids on this planet are getting a better education right now than Mateo and Luka, as they experience first-hand the wonders of the world.\n\nShare this video if you feel inspired (and if you wish your parents would have taken you to 50 countries before you turned 10)!\n\nFollow @drewbinsky on Insta for daily travel stories.

I am ecstatic to be spending the next 5 days road tripping around this most perfect country in the world!\n\nI first fell in love with Sri Lanka in 2014, but I didn\u2019t own a video camera back then... so I\u2019m thrilled to be here again and show you the wonderful sites and culture of this small island-nation in the Indian Ocean. \n\nIn all honesty, Sri Lanka might just be the \u201cmost perfect\u201d country in the world, or at least, out of the 153 countries that I have visited.  The food is amazing, the nature is breathtaking, the culture is unique, the people are friendly, the lifestyle is affordable \u2014 Sri Lanka is the definition of a travelers' paradise.\n\nHave you ever been to Sri Lanka?  Please recommend some places to visit or people to meet over the coming 5 days! \n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

I am ecstatic to be spending the next 5 days road tripping around this most perfect country in the world!\n\nI first fell in love with Sri Lanka in 2014, but I didn\u2019t own a video camera back then... so I\u2019m thrilled to be here again and show you the wonderful sites and culture of this small island-nation in the Indian Ocean. \n\nIn all honesty, Sri Lanka might just be the \u201cmost perfect\u201d country in the world, or at least, out of the 153 countries that I have visited.  The food is amazing, the nature is breathtaking, the culture is unique, the people are friendly, the lifestyle is affordable \u2014 Sri Lanka is the definition of a travelers' paradise.\n\nHave you ever been to Sri Lanka?  Please recommend some places to visit or people to meet over the coming 5 days! \n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

It's like burning man on steroids.\n\nI seriously cannot believe what I just experienced.  A town of complete unity and togetherness, with 3,000+ residents who come from 57 countries around the world.   A cashless society that has no religion, no laws and a 0% crime rate.   A place where anything is possible, and encouraged, with the most laidback lifestyle I've ever seen. \n\nThis is the real life Burning Man... and it's been around since 1968!\n\nHave you ever heard about Auroville? What are your thoughts about it?\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.  Thank you Michael (IG @affinityadventure) for the shots & edits.  \n\nPS - This video probably won't get the most views, but I had the most fun shooting it and putting this story together.  I love telling unique stories, such as Auroville, which are happening around our world.  If you have thoughts or comments on Auroville, please share below! I will be reading them all :)\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

                    "description": "The biggest reason I came to India was to visit Auroville and make this video so you all can learn about this bizarre experimental community.  It's like burning man on steroids.\n\nI seriously cannot believe what I just experienced.  A town of complete unity and togetherness, with 3,000+ residents who come from 57 countries around the world.   A cashless society that has no religion, no laws and a 0% crime rate.   A place where anything is possible, and encouraged, with the most laidback lifestyle I've ever seen. \n\nThis is the real life Burning Man... and it's been around since 1968!\n\nHave you ever heard about Auroville? What are your thoughts about it?\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.  Thank you Michael (IG @affinityadventure) for the shots & edits.  \n\nPS - This video probably won't get the most views, but I had the most fun shooting it and putting this story together.  I love telling unique stories, such as Auroville, which are happening around our world.  If you have thoughts or comments on Auroville, please share below! I will be reading them all :)\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

After speaking with them for about 30 minutes, I was in awe by their inspiring life story.  \n\nVijayan and his wife both shared a common dream to travel the world, but money was always an issue.  So 55 years ago, Vijayan took up selling tea on the streets of Kochi.\n\nThey saved 300 Rupees ($4.20) every day for decades, and they used this income (together with bank loans) to fund travels to 23 countries!   From Switzerland to Brazil to the USA, and they don't plan on stopping anytime soon.\n\nVijayan and Mohana are a perfect couple who is living the happiest life that anyone can live.  I am so happy that I dropped by their tea shop today, and I wish them the best of luck in their future travels!\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.

After speaking with them for about 30 minutes, I was in awe by their inspiring life story.  \n\nVijayan and his wife both shared a common dream to travel the world, but money was always an issue.  So 55 years ago, Vijayan took up selling tea on the streets of Kochi.\n\nThey saved 300 Rupees ($4.20) every day for decades, and they used this income (together with bank loans) to fund travels to 23 countries!   From Switzerland to Brazil to the USA, and they don't plan on stopping anytime soon.\n\nVijayan and Mohana are a perfect couple who is living the happiest life that anyone can live.  I am so happy that I dropped by their tea shop today, and I wish them the best of luck in their future travels!\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.

She offered to give me (and my parents) a massage, which we easily agreed because of her kindness and warming personality. \n\nNot only was her massage one of the best I've ever had, but her story is so eye opening that I decided to make this impromptu video.   \n\nShe has been working for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year on this exact beach since 1979, while raising 5 children.  The kicker? She makes an average of $25 USD per day. \n\nMeeting people like Mona Lisa is always a reality check for me to appreciate the life that I live, because I am lucky.  And if you are reading this right now, then you are also lucky because you have a computer and/or phone and internet access. \n\nAll too often, we take these things in our lives for granted.  \n\nInstagram @drewbinsky \n\nPS-- This video was entirely shot on my iPhone 10XS and Osmo Pocket.  It's the first time in 520+ videos that I didn't use my GH5 and mic.  Personally, I think the quality of the footage isn't so bad, but the audio needed help.  Would love to get your feedback on it!\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

                    "description": "While sitting on the beach today in Phuket, we were approached by a lovely lady named Mona Lisa.  She offered to give me (and my parents) a massage, which we easily agreed because of her kindness and warming personality. \n\nNot only was her massage one of the best I've ever had, but her story is so eye opening that I decided to make this impromptu video.   \n\nShe has been working for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year on this exact beach since 1979, while raising 5 children.  The kicker? She makes an average of $25 USD per day. \n\nMeeting people like Mona Lisa is always a reality check for me to appreciate the life that I live, because I am lucky.  And if you are reading this right now, then you are also lucky because you have a computer and/or phone and internet access. \n\nAll too often, we take these things in our lives for granted.  \n\nInstagram @drewbinsky \n\nPS-- This video was entirely shot on my iPhone 10XS and Osmo Pocket.  It's the first time in 520+ videos that I didn't use my GH5 and mic.  Personally, I think the quality of the footage isn't so bad, but the audio needed help.  Would love to get your feedback on it!\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

He has showed us the best Georgian hospitality possible, going above and beyond in making sure that we have a great time.  \n\nI originally wasn\u2019t planning to make a video about his life and being an albino, but the more time I spent with him and got to know him on a personal level, the more inclined I felt to share his story to the world.  \n\nI hope Bera serves as an inspiration to you as much as he does to me.  Because the honest truth is that nothing can ever stop you from achieving your dreams. \n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

He has showed us the best Georgian hospitality possible, going above and beyond in making sure that we have a great time.  \n\nI originally wasn\u2019t planning to make a video about his life and being an albino, but the more time I spent with him and got to know him on a personal level, the more inclined I felt to share his story to the world.  \n\nI hope Bera serves as an inspiration to you as much as he does to me.  Because the honest truth is that nothing can ever stop you from achieving your dreams. \n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

The 14 of us arrived in Ban Sam Kha -- a tiny Northern Thai village of 170 families, tucked away in the mountains and nestled in between luscious rice fields.\n\nIt was the simplest day I've spent in a long time.  \n\nWhen we arrived, we were welcomed into the village in a lovely Buddhist ceremony then invited for some home cooked dinner.  The following morning, we caught sunrise in the rice fields and learned how to harvest rice (it's harvesting season now!).  To wrap it up, we spent some time with kids in the school and they taught us how to weave Buddhist flags.\n\nIt feels like life moves in slow motion here.  Nobody is rushing to get anywhere.  And everyone is always smiling!  This place is a true paradise. \n\nSometimes when I spend too much time in cities, I forget how relaxing it is in the countryside (anywhere in the world).  It's like hitting the \"reset button\" on life.  I recommend taking a day trip to some small village sometime soon.  You will thank me later!\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.

It's called the WHITE TEMPLE in Chiang Rai, Thailand.  Have you ever heard of the white temple before?\n\nUnlike every other Buddhist temple, which uses traditional paintings, decorations and stories to tell the story of Buddha's life \u2014 the white temple uses icons from modern culture, such as spaceships, pikachu, superman and Michael Jackson.  You have to see it to believe it!\n\nFollow Drew Binsky for daily travel videos.  Instagram: @drewbinsky.

It's called the WHITE TEMPLE in Chiang Rai, Thailand.  Have you ever heard of the white temple before?\n\nUnlike every other Buddhist temple, which uses traditional paintings, decorations and stories to tell the story of Buddha's life \u2014 the white temple uses icons from modern culture, such as spaceships, pikachu, superman and Michael Jackson.  You have to see it to believe it!\n\nFollow Drew Binsky for daily travel videos.  Instagram: @drewbinsky.

                "description": "TEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854 \n\nI have finally met with the LONG NECK tribe of Northern Thailand - and they are truly some of the most fascinating humans on earth! \n\nAs you probably know, my favorite thing to do when traveling is to discover and interact with the most local people I can find. To eat their food, observe their homes and experience first-hand how they survive. \n\nI\u2019ve spent quality time with the Himba tribe of Namibia, the Mursi tribe of Ethiopia and the Huli tribe of Papua New Guinea. But never have I seen women wearing dozens of heavy metal rings around their neck... until I came to Northern Thailand!! \n\nThey wear the rings (traditionally) to protect from tiger bites, but also to differentiate from the other hi tribes of Myanmar/Thailand.. and of course, it\u2019s also a beauty/fashion thing!\n\nThe long necks are actually refugees from Myanmar who crossed the border in the 18th century and never returned back home. There are some 40,000 of them remaining today, mostly up in the mountains near the Burma border. \n\nHave you ever heard about the long neck tribe? What do you think about their culture? Comment below! \n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

                    "description": "TEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854 \n\nI have finally met with the LONG NECK tribe of Northern Thailand - and they are truly some of the most fascinating humans on earth! \n\nAs you probably know, my favorite thing to do when traveling is to discover and interact with the most local people I can find. To eat their food, observe their homes and experience first-hand how they survive. \n\nI\u2019ve spent quality time with the Himba tribe of Namibia, the Mursi tribe of Ethiopia and the Huli tribe of Papua New Guinea. But never have I seen women wearing dozens of heavy metal rings around their neck... until I came to Northern Thailand!! \n\nThey wear the rings (traditionally) to protect from tiger bites, but also to differentiate from the other hi tribes of Myanmar/Thailand.. and of course, it\u2019s also a beauty/fashion thing!\n\nThe long necks are actually refugees from Myanmar who crossed the border in the 18th century and never returned back home. There are some 40,000 of them remaining today, mostly up in the mountains near the Burma border. \n\nHave you ever heard about the long neck tribe? What do you think about their culture? Comment below! \n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

He really does everything!\n\nWhen he saw that I was coming to Gabon, he immediately reached out on Facebook and offered to show me around his hometown of Libreville. Not only did he pick me up at the airport, give me a room in his house to crash at and take me all over his town of Libreville, Gabon \u2014 but he wouldn\u2019t let me spend a dime. \n\nI tried and tried and tried to pay for food, gas, etc, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. What did he expect in return? Absolutely nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s people like Patrick who make me really appreciate the people all over the world. He will be in all of my upcoming Gabon videos so stay tuned!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

He really does everything!\n\nWhen he saw that I was coming to Gabon, he immediately reached out on Facebook and offered to show me around his hometown of Libreville. Not only did he pick me up at the airport, give me a room in his house to crash at and take me all over his town of Libreville, Gabon \u2014 but he wouldn\u2019t let me spend a dime. \n\nI tried and tried and tried to pay for food, gas, etc, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. What did he expect in return? Absolutely nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s people like Patrick who make me really appreciate the people all over the world. He will be in all of my upcoming Gabon videos so stay tuned!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

I am still in shock by what I have just experienced in the world's oldest desert, dating back 80 million years... But that's not even the coolest part. \n\nNamibia's desert is home to the largest and tallest SAND DUNES on earth -- reaching up to 1,200 feet high. I spent all day trekking around these dunes and I am left speechless. \n\nHAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO NAMIBIA? If not, then add it to your list! \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

Here we gooooooooooo!\n\nThanks to Booking.com for supporting this video.

                    "description": "TOMORROW, I'm leaving for a massive trip around Central and West Africa to 9 countries -- Namibia, Angola, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Gabon, Chad, Mali & Mauritania.\n\nThis trip to Africa has been VERY challenging to plan, tedious to get visas for (5 countries), and extremely expensive to book flights & hotels ($15K+ out of pocket) -- but it's going to be a trip of a lifetime and I CAN'T WAIT to show you places that you've probably never heard of before. \n\nSafety is my biggest concern on this trip, as most of these countries aren't built for tourism and I am going in with all of my camera gear, etc -- so I decided to make this video, which explains 3 ways I am keeping myself safe! \n\nAre you ready to see brand new content from Central/West Africa? Here we gooooooooooo!\n\nThanks to Booking.com for supporting this video.

It's fun being spontaneous sometimes. \n\nI arrived in the capital of Madagascar called Antananarivo early this morning with no hotel reservation, no plan and no idea what I'd be doing... Just seeking adventure!\n\nThrough Facebook, I got in touch with a local girl named Ali, who picked me up at the airport with her 2 classmate friends, Dave and Nancy. Not only have they been AMAZING tour guides around Antananarivo, but Dave volunteered to let me sleep at his house with his family -- who cooked me a delicious dinner of Madagascar food called Vary Amin\u2019anana. Life doesn't get any better than this!\n\nToday is a day that I'll never forget. I am so happy to be back in Africa and so thankful to be able to find people like Ali, Dave & Nancy from social media. I can't wait to see more of Madagascar over the coming days!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

It's fun being spontaneous sometimes. \n\nI arrived in the capital of Madagascar called Antananarivo early this morning with no hotel reservation, no plan and no idea what I'd be doing... Just seeking adventure!\n\nThrough Facebook, I got in touch with a local girl named Ali, who picked me up at the airport with her 2 classmate friends, Dave and Nancy. Not only have they been AMAZING tour guides around Antananarivo, but Dave volunteered to let me sleep at his house with his family -- who cooked me a delicious dinner of Madagascar food called Vary Amin\u2019anana. Life doesn't get any better than this!\n\nToday is a day that I'll never forget. I am so happy to be back in Africa and so thankful to be able to find people like Ali, Dave & Nancy from social media. I can't wait to see more of Madagascar over the coming days!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

It's all about the ladyboy culture in Thailand. \n\nLadyboys, or transgenders, are extremely common in Thailand and you will see them everywhere \u2014 on the streets, on the metro, in restaurants and especially in nightlife areas. Many times, you won't even notice it's a ladyboy, since they look like beautiful women.\n\nThe reason I made this video is to A) educate you about the ladyboy culture in Thailand and B) tell you how accepting Thailand is to treat them like normal members of society. It's remarkable.\n\nAs you and I both know, dozens and dozens of countries in today's world are moving in the opposite direction towards acceptance of those in the LGBTQ community \u2014 so this video can be a lesson to the world. \n\nThey are just people \u2014 let them live their lives. \n\nWhat are you thoughts on ladyboys? Would love to get your opinions. Thank you\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout? Request a custom video from me on CAMEO: https://www.cameo.com/drewbinsky\n\nP.S... P.S. - I apologize for my hoarse voice \u2014 I picked up some infection and it went straight to my throat!\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFacebook @drewbinsky: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baInstagram @drewbinsky: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baTwitter @drewbinsky: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

                    "description": "TEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854 \n\nThis is a video I've been wanting to make since I moved to Thailand. It's all about the ladyboy culture in Thailand. \n\nLadyboys, or transgenders, are extremely common in Thailand and you will see them everywhere \u2014 on the streets, on the metro, in restaurants and especially in nightlife areas. Many times, you won't even notice it's a ladyboy, since they look like beautiful women.\n\nThe reason I made this video is to A) educate you about the ladyboy culture in Thailand and B) tell you how accepting Thailand is to treat them like normal members of society. It's remarkable.\n\nAs you and I both know, dozens and dozens of countries in today's world are moving in the opposite direction towards acceptance of those in the LGBTQ community \u2014 so this video can be a lesson to the world. \n\nThey are just people \u2014 let them live their lives. \n\nWhat are you thoughts on ladyboys? Would love to get your opinions. Thank you\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Mr. Big is the definition of a role model to these kids. \n\nAlso - Mr. Big kept repeating his philosophy in life, which is to keep giving back, and in the long run, you will eventually get back in return. He doesn't care about money. He geniunely wants to see others succeed. \n\nThese are only the bullet points of Mr. Big's story -- I encourage you to learn the rest in this video, that I am very proud of! \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

No way around it, unless you hold an Indian passport where you are exempt from these fees.  Yes, Bhutan is expensive, but yes, Bhutan is worth it (trust me!)\n\nWHY DO THEY CHARGE $250 PER PERSON PER DAY?\n\nIn this video, I explain the reasoning behind why the Bhutanese government charges such a hefty fee, and why I strongly believe that it's worth spending the money to visit!\n\nHave you ever been to Bhutan? Are you planning to go?

No way around it, unless you hold an Indian passport where you are exempt from these fees.  Yes, Bhutan is expensive, but yes, Bhutan is worth it (trust me!)\n\nWHY DO THEY CHARGE $250 PER PERSON PER DAY?\n\nIn this video, I explain the reasoning behind why the Bhutanese government charges such a hefty fee, and why I strongly believe that it's worth spending the money to visit!\n\nHave you ever been to Bhutan? Are you planning to go?

I've asked several people when they were born, and they couldn't give me an answer... because they don't know. \n\nWhy?\n\nThe Bhutanese genuinely believe that leading a happy life is more important than how many years you\u2019ve been alive (birthday). If that doesn't make you smile, then I don't know what will :)\n\nInstead of recognizing individual birthdays \u2013 they decided that all citizens turn 1 year older every Jan 1st. So everyone celebrates a birthday on New Year's Day! \n\nWhile this system is more prevalent in the older generation (younger kids living in cities do know their birthdays) -- it's still proves how fascinating this country is. I've never been to a place where people don't know their birthdays, and don't care to know. They just want to life in peace.\n\nThe sun rises everyday. The sun sets everyday. Life happens. Age doesn't matter. That's Bhutan in a nutshell. And I love this country.\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

I've asked several people when they were born, and they couldn't give me an answer... because they don't know. \n\nWhy?\n\nThe Bhutanese genuinely believe that leading a happy life is more important than how many years you\u2019ve been alive (birthday). If that doesn't make you smile, then I don't know what will :)\n\nInstead of recognizing individual birthdays \u2013 they decided that all citizens turn 1 year older every Jan 1st. So everyone celebrates a birthday on New Year's Day! \n\nWhile this system is more prevalent in the older generation (younger kids living in cities do know their birthdays) -- it's still proves how fascinating this country is. I've never been to a place where people don't know their birthdays, and don't care to know. They just want to life in peace.\n\nThe sun rises everyday. The sun sets everyday. Life happens. Age doesn't matter. That's Bhutan in a nutshell. And I love this country.\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

I also need access to (the best) wifi everyday so I can work and upload videos!\n\nTruth be told, I am really excited for this trip and to witness the hidden cultures in these African countries first-hand. Have you ever been to any of these 9 countries in Africa? I will gladly take some tips/advice or any local connection!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Are you on Instagram?

Nothing has gone right. And I am very frustrated.\n\nThis morning, I woke up at 5AM ready to explore Mah\u00e9 island (the main island of the Seychelles), but a rain storm came rolling through which forced me to delay the morning start until 9:30. When I hopped on the bus to the beach, there was a bad car accident in the road, causing another hour delay and everybody freaking out. Finally, I made it to the beach, only to discover everything being closed because it's a National Holiday today in the Seychelles. So I went to the capital town of Victoria, which was more like a ghost town as no restaurants or stores are open. I managed to find a small shop to get snacks, and while I was inside the store, I witnessed a bad street fight happening between two drunk people outside.

Nothing has gone right. And I am very frustrated.\n\nThis morning, I woke up at 5AM ready to explore Mah\u00e9 island (the main island of the Seychelles), but a rain storm came rolling through which forced me to delay the morning start until 9:30. When I hopped on the bus to the beach, there was a bad car accident in the road, causing another hour delay and everybody freaking out. Finally, I made it to the beach, only to discover everything being closed because it's a National Holiday today in the Seychelles. So I went to the capital town of Victoria, which was more like a ghost town as no restaurants or stores are open. I managed to find a small shop to get snacks, and while I was inside the store, I witnessed a bad street fight happening between two drunk people outside.  That's what I call a disaster in the Seychelles.\n\nDespite being really frustrated and upset, I realized that none of these events have been in my control -- and that's why I should not hate the Seychelles.\n\nThis also is a reminder not hate ANY place based on unexpected events that happen out of your control (bad weather, breaking your arm, public holidays, etc).\n\nSimilar unfortunate events have happened to me in other countries, like Bulgaria, Brunei and India -- and when these situations happen, we need to be mature and move on.

What is your favorite part about the country?\n\nSpecial thanks to Mauritius Tourism for inviting us, Solana Beach Mauritius for hosting us and My Moris for the delicioud street food tour!\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n\u25ba Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25baFacebook @drewbinsky: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n\u25baInstagram @drewbinsky: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25baSnapchat @drewbinsky\n\u25baTwitter @drewbinsky: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com"
