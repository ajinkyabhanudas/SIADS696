We visited JEM FX to find out how its team of effects wizards primes cars to get destroyed spectacularly on camera.\n\nTaking a Buick LeSabre as our case study, JEM\u2019s technicians showed us how they score a car\u2019s roof pillars and replace its door hinges to set it up for optimal wreckage. Then we saw how the weakened car responded to various forms of destruction, from having a 3,000-pound weight dropped on its roof to getting its doors whacked off with a forklift.\n\nThe team at JEM also walked us through some highlights of their automobile effects work on \u201cShang-Chi\u201d (2021), \u201cBright\u201d (2017), \u201cTaken 3\u201d (2014), and \u201cVelvet Buzzsaw\u201d (2019).\n\nFor more from JEM FX:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jemfxpopov\nhttps://www.jemfx.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56P9S13ByG42-s9_7h6ZtA\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nDrummer Rates 7 Drum Scenes in Movies and TV | How Real Is It? | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/uiPGInapHdA\nHow Fight Scene Props Are Made For Movies & TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/4icFrd_o6cQ\nEgyptologist Rates 8 Ancient Egypt Scenes In Movies and TV | How Real Is It? | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/63ehVX5PZT4\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Cars #MoviesInsider #Insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "Former US Army Parachute Team member and combat veteran Michael Elliott rates nine airborne jumps in movies, such as \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout,\" for realism.\n\nElliott breaks down the accuracy of static-line jumps, skydiving scenes and military free falls, such as HALO jumps, in \"Godzilla\" (2014), and \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\" (2018), starring Tom Cruise. He rates paratrooper jumps in \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977). He looks at the realism of demonstration and competitive-style skydiving in \"San Andreas\" (2015), \"Die Another Day\" (2002), and \"Point Break\" (1991), starring Keanu Reeves. He also breaks down the plausibility of emergency-parachuting techniques in \"Drop Zone\" (1994), \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" (2014), and \"Black Widow\" (2021), starring Scarlett Johansson.\n\nElliott is a 26-year combat veteran and was a member of the US Army Parachute Team, nicknamed the Golden Knights, for 11 years. He is the founder and president of the All Veteran Group, a parachute team of active and retired military members that focuses on parachute demonstrations and tandem parachute experiences.\n\nYou can follow Michael here:\nhttps://www.allveterangroup.org\nhttps://www.facebook.com/allveterangroup\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

He also breaks down the development of tanks from World War I to modern times in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (1989) and \"Courage Under Fire\" (1996).\n\nMoran is an armor officer on M1 Abrams tanks and M3 Bradleys, with combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is the in-house historian for the online game \"World of Tanks,\" and he has a YouTube channel covering armored history.\n\nYou can follow Nicholas here:\nhttps://youtube.com/c/TheChieftainsHatch\nhttps://twitter.com/chieftain_armor\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

                "description": "One of the biggest challenges for Hollywood\u2019s stunt performers is creating flight that is both safe and believable. Since George Reeves portrayed Superman in the 1950s, movies and TV shows have used an endless variety of wires, pans, and other rigs to lift actors up high. The best tools depend on the type of flying on-screen. A huge breakthrough came in 1978's \u201cSuperman\u201d when a visual effects artist discovered a way to operate the camera so that Christopher Reeve would appear to be flying even when he was lying flat. Today, many of those same wire and camera tricks are still used. However, digital doubles can make even the most dangerous flying tricks possible, while flying moves can be programmed in advance into a robotic arm, as seen in \u201cBlack Widow.\u201d Elizabeth Olsen\u2019s stunt double, CC Ice, told us about the many ways both Marvel\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d and \u201cWandaVision\u201d made Wanda Maximoff fly.\n\nThanks to everyone who spoke with us and shared footage for this story:\nCC Ice - https://www.instagram.com/cc_ice_stunts/\nRob Inch - https://www.instagram.com/allstunts/\nDayna Grant - https://www.instagram.com/daynastunts/\nChristiaan Bettridge: https://www.instagram.com/stannibombani/\nZac Henry: https://www.instagram.com/zac.henry/\nRobomoco: https://robomoco.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/robomoco/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/RobomocoUK\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS: \nHow Superhero Costumes Evolved From 'Adventures Of Superman' To 'The Batman' | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkhrw0q5JBo\nWhy Helicopters Are Used to Film Action Scenes | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInlj2bV9u0&t=65s\nHow 'No Way Home' Pulled Off Spider-Man's Bridge Fight Against Doctor Octopus | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqSYUu2uWJQ\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#filming #moviesinsider #insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                    "description": "One of the biggest challenges for Hollywood\u2019s stunt performers is creating flight that is both safe and believable. Since George Reeves portrayed Superman in the 1950s, movies and TV shows have used an endless variety of wires, pans, and other rigs to lift actors up high. The best tools depend on the type of flying on-screen. A huge breakthrough came in 1978's \u201cSuperman\u201d when a visual effects artist discovered a way to operate the camera so that Christopher Reeve would appear to be flying even when he was lying flat. Today, many of those same wire and camera tricks are still used. However, digital doubles can make even the most dangerous flying tricks possible, while flying moves can be programmed in advance into a robotic arm, as seen in \u201cBlack Widow.\u201d Elizabeth Olsen\u2019s stunt double, CC Ice, told us about the many ways both Marvel\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d and \u201cWandaVision\u201d made Wanda Maximoff fly.\n\nThanks to everyone who spoke with us and shared footage for this story:\nCC Ice - https://www.instagram.com/cc_ice_stunts/\nRob Inch - https://www.instagram.com/allstunts/\nDayna Grant - https://www.instagram.com/daynastunts/\nChristiaan Bettridge: https://www.instagram.com/stannibombani/\nZac Henry: https://www.instagram.com/zac.henry/\nRobomoco: https://robomoco.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/robomoco/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/RobomocoUK\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS: \nHow Superhero Costumes Evolved From 'Adventures Of Superman' To 'The Batman' | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkhrw0q5JBo\nWhy Helicopters Are Used to Film Action Scenes | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInlj2bV9u0&t=65s\nHow 'No Way Home' Pulled Off Spider-Man's Bridge Fight Against Doctor Octopus | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqSYUu2uWJQ\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#filming #moviesinsider #insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

Sarah walked us through how to create convincing fresh and aged blood stains on a shirt, what materials look the most like dirt, and the very specific way to make a bullet hole look realistic.\n\nCheck out more of Sarah Blostein\u2019s work:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/breakdownbadass/\nhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm7952058/\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The fake sweat Sarah uses in the video is a mixture of water and paint. Baby oil or glycerine are commonly used to create fake sweat on set. Additionally, Sarah used dark brown paint, as opposed to black, for the dried blood in \u201cReady or Not.\u201d\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Old Movies Are Professionally Restored | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/6NzfJJny3Yg\nHow 5 Movie Props Are Made To Be Eaten | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/rz34XZCqBH4\nHow Mirror Scenes Are Shot In Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/sSZTAlACAJI\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Costume #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                    "description": "Breakdown artists, sometimes called agers, dyers, or textile artists, work behind the scenes to fake all the damage on a character\u2019s costume. Sarah Blostein has done breakdown work on \u201cThe Boys,\u201d \u201cThe Strain,\u201d \u201cReady or Not,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and \u201cStation Eleven.\u201d Because movie and TV show scenes are frequently shot out of order, sweat stains and rips have to be replicated. Sarah walked us through how to create convincing fresh and aged blood stains on a shirt, what materials look the most like dirt, and the very specific way to make a bullet hole look realistic.\n\nCheck out more of Sarah Blostein\u2019s work:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/breakdownbadass/\nhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm7952058/\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The fake sweat Sarah uses in the video is a mixture of water and paint. Baby oil or glycerine are commonly used to create fake sweat on set. Additionally, Sarah used dark brown paint, as opposed to black, for the dried blood in \u201cReady or Not.\u201d\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Old Movies Are Professionally Restored | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/6NzfJJny3Yg\nHow 5 Movie Props Are Made To Be Eaten | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/rz34XZCqBH4\nHow Mirror Scenes Are Shot In Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/sSZTAlACAJI\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Costume #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "While there are shots so complicated that they require full CGI, many movies still try to make practical creatures that can interact with actors on set. For \u201cGhostbusters: Afterlife,\u201d creature effects designer Arjen Tuiten and his team were tasked with bringing the terror dog from the original \u201cGhostbusters\u201d movie back to life. This required creating a 450-pound animatronic out of lifelike materials. They placed 21 motors in its face to allow for realistic expressions such as snarling, squinting, and breathing. Meanwhile, the team created a separate terror dog leg to terrify Paul Rudd in a close-up shot. And a more traditional, but no less complicated cable system allowed a skeleton puppet to actually pick up a coffee mug.\n\nFollow Arjen on Instagram to see more of his special makeup effects work:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/_a_r_j_e_n_/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Bleeding Prosthetics Are Created For Movies And TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/g4Fi8IN0LrY\nHow Marvel\u2019s 'Shang-Chi' Pulled Off Its Seven Minute Bus Fight | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/1eE5XlL5LDQ\nHow Scream Artists Create The Perfect Screams For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/W02Q63vAeLY\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Ghostbusters #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                    "description": "While there are shots so complicated that they require full CGI, many movies still try to make practical creatures that can interact with actors on set. For \u201cGhostbusters: Afterlife,\u201d creature effects designer Arjen Tuiten and his team were tasked with bringing the terror dog from the original \u201cGhostbusters\u201d movie back to life. This required creating a 450-pound animatronic out of lifelike materials. They placed 21 motors in its face to allow for realistic expressions such as snarling, squinting, and breathing. Meanwhile, the team created a separate terror dog leg to terrify Paul Rudd in a close-up shot. And a more traditional, but no less complicated cable system allowed a skeleton puppet to actually pick up a coffee mug.\n\nFollow Arjen on Instagram to see more of his special makeup effects work:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/_a_r_j_e_n_/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Bleeding Prosthetics Are Created For Movies And TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/g4Fi8IN0LrY\nHow Marvel\u2019s 'Shang-Chi' Pulled Off Its Seven Minute Bus Fight | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/1eE5XlL5LDQ\nHow Scream Artists Create The Perfect Screams For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/W02Q63vAeLY\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Ghostbusters #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

They show us how they would create the effects for a cut artery, an abdomen slash, a gunshot to the head, and more, using materials ranging from a garden sprayer to a blood cannon.\nThey break down how to pull off grounded, realistic blood effects, like a bullet or laceration wound, as well as more stylized ones, like a Quentin Tarantino-style kill.

They show us how they would create the effects for a cut artery, an abdomen slash, a gunshot to the head, and more, using materials ranging from a garden sprayer to a blood cannon.\nThey break down how to pull off grounded, realistic blood effects, like a bullet or laceration wound, as well as more stylized ones, like a Quentin Tarantino-style kill. Find out the distinct challenges of making actors convincingly gush, spurt, and spill blood on screen.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/spfxmakeupstudio/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bschmidtfx/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/gregpikulski/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow \u2018Shang-Chi\u2019 Pulled Off A Seven Minute Fight On A Moving Bus | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eE5XlL5LDQ&t=1s\nHow 8 Extreme Weather Scenes Were Made for Movies | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hrSTLo44A\n7 Classic Movie Tricks That Led To Modern CGI | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt8_sYKpdBE\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Prosthetics #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

In this episode of \"Movies Insider,\" she breaks down how she'd transform a contemporary New York City street to look like a 1957 time capsule. \n\nRena takes us through Eclectic/Encore Props in Long Island City, Queens, and shows us the period products and street dressing she would use to rewind time on a modern city. Find out how set decorators dress windows, create fake storefronts, and cover up modern signifiers to make filming locations resemble an era of the past.\n\nRena has worked on a long list of period pieces, from \"Mad Men\" to \"The Help.\" She is a frequent collaborator of Steven Spielberg's, having worked on three of the director's historical dramas: \"West Side Story,\" \"Bridge of Spies,\" and \"The Post.\" \n\nFor more from Eclectic/Encore Props: \nhttps://www.eclecticprops.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/eclecticprops/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow \u2018No Time To Die\u2019 Pulled Off James Bond\u2019s Opening Chase | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/q_5MJv-Jjy0\nHow Talking Animals Are Created For Movies | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/ke4Isk-po2Y\nWhat 7 Fake Injuries Look Like Behind The Scenes | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/NT9npI1lsi4\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#SetDecorator #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

In this episode of \"Movies Insider,\" she breaks down how she'd transform a contemporary New York City street to look like a 1957 time capsule. \n\nRena takes us through Eclectic/Encore Props in Long Island City, Queens, and shows us the period products and street dressing she would use to rewind time on a modern city. Find out how set decorators dress windows, create fake storefronts, and cover up modern signifiers to make filming locations resemble an era of the past.\n\nRena has worked on a long list of period pieces, from \"Mad Men\" to \"The Help.\" She is a frequent collaborator of Steven Spielberg's, having worked on three of the director's historical dramas: \"West Side Story,\" \"Bridge of Spies,\" and \"The Post.\" \n\nFor more from Eclectic/Encore Props: \nhttps://www.eclecticprops.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/eclecticprops/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow \u2018No Time To Die\u2019 Pulled Off James Bond\u2019s Opening Chase | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/q_5MJv-Jjy0\nHow Talking Animals Are Created For Movies | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/ke4Isk-po2Y\nWhat 7 Fake Injuries Look Like Behind The Scenes | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/NT9npI1lsi4\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#SetDecorator #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

The shoe is significant because of its rarity, even in an old condition. Michael Jordan's original 1985 Chicago Air Jordan 1s sold at auction in 2020 for $560,000. On the market, a good pair can cost anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000. Because the client wanted to keep the originality of the shoes, they will be resoled using a donor sole. The team will go through the process of how they do this professionally to give the soles a seamless finish.  \n\nFor more, visit:\nhttps://thecobblers.com/  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecobblersofficial/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCobblersUSA\n\nMORE REFURBISHED VIDEOS:\nHow $1,000 Louboutins Are Professionally Restored | Refurbished\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrxDFOEqLbE\nHow $700 Ferragamo Loafers Are Professionally Restored | Refurbished\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4PmmoHKlU8\nHow Dr. Martens Get Professionally Restored | Refurbished\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EatME6K387I\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#AirJordan1s #Refurbished #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                    "description": "The Cobblers is a shoe-repair shop in Miami. The shoe it's working on today is a rare pair of 1985 Chicago Air Jordan 1s that a client brought in to be resoled. The shoe is significant because of its rarity, even in an old condition. Michael Jordan's original 1985 Chicago Air Jordan 1s sold at auction in 2020 for $560,000. On the market, a good pair can cost anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000. Because the client wanted to keep the originality of the shoes, they will be resoled using a donor sole. The team will go through the process of how they do this professionally to give the soles a seamless finish.  \n\nFor more, visit:\nhttps://thecobblers.com/  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecobblersofficial/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCobblersUSA\n\nMORE REFURBISHED VIDEOS:\nHow $1,000 Louboutins Are Professionally Restored | Refurbished\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrxDFOEqLbE\nHow $700 Ferragamo Loafers Are Professionally Restored | Refurbished\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4PmmoHKlU8\nHow Dr. Martens Get Professionally Restored | Refurbished\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EatME6K387I\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#AirJordan1s #Refurbished #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

Major breakthroughs occurred during \"The Incredibles,\" in which animators now had the capability to give humans muscles and skin that moved like the real thing, eventually allowing \"Ratatouille\" to stretch the human mouth far and control a character's loose movements. Meanwhile in \"Cars,\" a new technology called ground locking let cars drive on a straight path, while new stretchy rigs were created for realistic octopus tentacles in \"Finding Dory\" and an especially dynamic dog tongue in \"Coco.\" Thanks to new features, like the ability to add tendons onto hands and a digital piano that played by itself, Pixar was able to show complex piano playing.

                "description": "Lighting is essential in 3D animated films for a few reasons: It tells the time of day, makes objects appear more lifelike, and can even convey the mood of a given moment. You can see this in Netflix's \"Over the Moon.\" Animators start with colorscripts, which portray the entire emotional story arc of a film and guide the lighting decisions. For \"Over the Moon,\" Clara Chan and the CG team were tasked with the lighting on both Earth and Lunaria. When adding light to scenes, human skin begins to look more real, while a shiny jacket will begin to look like a real puffer. Then, through ray and path tracing, features like shadows and reflections are naturally added in the rendering process. And while a lot of 3D lighting is calculated by a computer, lighting artists still have a great amount of control. For instance, the computer created really heavy shadows cast off Fei Fei's bangs, which Clara then lightened and eliminated. In general, lighting artists control the intensity of light, the placement, and the color. Lighting decisions also intentionally create mood. Like for a scene in \"Incredibles 2,\" using fluorescent lights had an emotional purpose, while in \"Over the Moon,\" focusing on intense lantern light rather than moonlight created a desired warmth.\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Fake Facial Hair Is Made For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x53ux2GyTDw&t=20s\nHow Bodysuits Are Designed To Look Realistic In Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVqgzW2V9OA\nHow Hollywood Makes Characters Walk On Walls | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwObBhFCDJ0&t=35s\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Movies #Animation #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                    "description": "Lighting is essential in 3D animated films for a few reasons: It tells the time of day, makes objects appear more lifelike, and can even convey the mood of a given moment. You can see this in Netflix's \"Over the Moon.\" Animators start with colorscripts, which portray the entire emotional story arc of a film and guide the lighting decisions. For \"Over the Moon,\" Clara Chan and the CG team were tasked with the lighting on both Earth and Lunaria. When adding light to scenes, human skin begins to look more real, while a shiny jacket will begin to look like a real puffer. Then, through ray and path tracing, features like shadows and reflections are naturally added in the rendering process. And while a lot of 3D lighting is calculated by a computer, lighting artists still have a great amount of control. For instance, the computer created really heavy shadows cast off Fei Fei's bangs, which Clara then lightened and eliminated. In general, lighting artists control the intensity of light, the placement, and the color. Lighting decisions also intentionally create mood. Like for a scene in \"Incredibles 2,\" using fluorescent lights had an emotional purpose, while in \"Over the Moon,\" focusing on intense lantern light rather than moonlight created a desired warmth.\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Fake Facial Hair Is Made For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x53ux2GyTDw&t=20s\nHow Bodysuits Are Designed To Look Realistic In Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVqgzW2V9OA\nHow Hollywood Makes Characters Walk On Walls | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwObBhFCDJ0&t=35s\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Movies #Animation #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "Sometimes, an actor can\u2019t grow a piece of facial hair they need for a role. Other times, it is better for continuity to be clean shaven. In cases like this, makeup and hair artists will create fake facial hair for performers, from sideburns to mustaches to eyebrows and beards. Makeup artist John Blake of John Blake\u2019s Wigs made a fake beard for some scenes for Kurt Russell in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\u201d Pieces like that can be made on a very durable piece of lace, where the artist must painstakingly punch individual hairs into every hole of the piece. These pieces are great for action scenes because they stay tight on the face, but they\u2019re also uncomfortable. \n\nAnother method is instead hand laying clumps of hair directly on an actor\u2019s face. Blake did this for John C. Reilly for several scenes in \u201cWalk Hard.\u201d While less durable, hand-laid facial hair allows actors more freedom to move their face around. Meanwhile, this method is also great if you need to add more hairs to an actor\u2019s already existing facial hair, which is what Richard Redlefsen did for actor Martin Starr when he needed to give his character a longer and older-looking beard in HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d \n\nThen, special effects makeup artist Kenneth Calhoun showed us how to float off a beard, which is when you build a beard on a fake head and then take it off as one piece using a brush. They are great for background characters and performers who will only be on set for a short amount of time. In addition, Calhoun also has to put hairs on fake bodies and prosthetic pieces. When punching eyelashes into a fake head, he has to make sure the lashes both fan out and curl. \n\nNo matter what the facial hair piece looks like or how it\u2019s made, there are a few things they must follow to look real: they must be a blend of multiple colors, use the correct type of hair for just the right texture, and be styled like any real piece of hair would be.\n\nThank you to all the makeup artists who provided us with footage and photos.

We regret the oversight.\nPaul Lowe: https://www.instagram.com/littlelowey/\nEdd Osmond: https://www.instagram.com/eddosmond/\n\nDisney\u2019s live-action \u201cDumbo\u201d remake featured the beloved baby elephant made completely from CGI. However, they still needed an actor to play Dumbo. That\u2019s where Edd Osmond, an actor and creature performer, stepped in. While creature performers are typically known for wearing costumes and heavy prosthetics, sometimes they need nothing but a green suit. \u201cDumbo\u201d is out now on Digital and Blu-ray.\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER CONTENT:\nHow Pixar's Animation Has Evolved Over 24 Years, From \u2018Toy Story\u2019 To \u2018Toy Story 4\u2019 | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTPKGVrFtQU\nHow 'Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu' Was Animated | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4thFZuASzhg\nHow Actors Train Their Voices For Animated Movies | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwptXx_2Fq4\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Dumbo #CGI #INSIDER\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "Cutting hair with fire was popular in Italy in the 20th century. Today, many barber shops have stopped practising this technique, except for Antica Barbieria Colla, in Milan.\n\nSo why is having your hair cut with fire still a thing?\n\n\"The reason why this is done is because it\u2019s good for the hair because the candle welds the part of the hair that has been cut off, and the keratin inside the hair strengthens,\" founder and creative director Francesca Bompieri told INSIDER. \"If you cut only the tip and the hair is very weak, it can be split in two, the famous split ends.\"\n\nAntica Barbieria Colla was founded in 1904 by Dino Colla, and it soon stood out among barber shops in Milan. In 1949, ownership passed over to Franco Bompieri, who has now retired and left his daughter, Francesca, to run it.\n\n\"The thing with this haircut is, if you do a stylized haircut, the flame will change it,\" said Francesca. \"So style is something that\u2019s a bit different from what you can do using the candle. Essentially what we do here is, trying to give a style to the client, of course, but something classic that allows us to use the candle as final step. Because we care more about the health of the hair. This treatment is good for you if your hair is weak, if something unexpected happened and you need to strengthen it.\"\n\nThe shop uses a candlewick which is made bespoke by a supplier.\n\n\"It\u2019s a specific object that has to be made in a specific way. The thing is, there doesn\u2019t need to be any drops when you use the flame, otherwise the hair would be damaged. Therefore, you need a small amount of wax.\"\n\nFor more, visit: \nhttps://www.anticabarbieriacollashop.com/en/\n\nMORE HAIR CONTENT:\nMeet The Barber Behind Paul Pogba\u2019s Famous Haircuts\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9LQYJ5hhlI\nLA\u2019s Best Barber Is A Woman Breaking Gender Stereotypes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqZpJK07cTI\n7-Year-Old Boy\u2019s Hair Is Changing The Modeling Industry\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atquNd1JCEQ\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

In it, we get a glimpse of where some of TV's favorite characters, now entering their teenage years, are heading next, including Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), and Will (Noah Schnapp). We also see crowd favorites like Jim Hopper (David Harbour), Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), and Steve Harrington (Joe Keery).\n\nThe trailer gives us clues about when the season takes place, new characters, and important locations, like the Starcourt Mall. From start to finish the trailer is filled with nods to the time period, from songs from \u201cThe Who\u201d and \u201cM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce,\u201d and toys from the '80s. We also get small details that are important callbacks from seasons 1 and 2 that may be important for the upcoming season.

'Gun Rush' is a popular course aimed at rising stunt performers who want to learn how to safely handle firearms for use in action sequences. We took the full-day course outside of Woking, west of London, to find out how firearms stunts are co-ordinated.\u00a0\n\nFounder Andreas Petrides has been working in the industry for over 28 years. He has worked on \"Gladiator\", four \"James Bond\" movies, \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Star Wars\" to name a few. As part of the course, Andreas runs through safety drills and shares his industry experience. Training is done with rifle, 8mm hand gun, Uzi and M4.\n\nMovies use a range of weapons during filming. \u2018Blanks\u2019 are working weapons loaded with blank cartridges. These produce a big muzzle flash or a loud \u2018bang.\u2019 There are replica guns, or for less detailed dummy guns \u2014 ones made of rubber.\u00a0Actors need to know how to adopt a convincing gun stance. Two of these examples are a Boxer stance and a Weaver stance.\u00a0 \n\nThe prop guns themselves go hand in hand with sound design. When a gun fires, you're hearing three acoustic elements.

                "description": "Gongbang is a type of YouTube video in which people film themselves studying. These videos have become really popular, with some getting millions of views over time. People who create and watch these study videos say they do it to help them focus and ultimately pass their exams.\n\nThe Man Sitting Next To Me:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5F_d3cnqsl_6syKejWVWxw\nTheStrive Studies:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSQkQjPhnZw12Hj-SfsbX8w\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nNarrator: Why study alone, when you can study with a bunch of strangers from all over the world?\n\nThis is gongbang, which translates to \"study broadcast\" in Korean. In Japan, it's known as benkyou douga, and in the US and other parts of the world, it's simply called \"study with me.\" It's a type of video in which people prepare for an exam on camera, while other people watch and study as well.\n\nThis might not sound like riveting entertainment, but these videos are racking up millions of views on YouTube. So why are they so popular? And is this just the latest example of lazy content creation, or is there something more going on here?\n\nThe Man Sitting Next to Me: When you're studying by yourself, you can feel alone. But they can reduce their loneliness by getting the sensation of studying with other people.\n\nNarrator: This YouTuber goes by the name \"The Man Sitting Next to Me.\" He prefers to remain anonymous. He lives in Korea and is studying to be a tax accountant. He livestreams himself studying for hours at a time and has over 20 thousand subscribers on his channel.\n\nThe Man Sitting Next to Me: It depends on my exam schedule, but, in general, I broadcast from 9 a.m to 12 a.m.\n\nNarrator: His videos show him simply sitting at a desk taking notes or looking at a book.\n\nJamie Lee: You're studying for a long time whether it's for high school, college, or a professional degree. It can be really lonely, and it's always helpful to have sort of a study buddy. \n\nNarrator: This is Jamie. She lives in New York and runs a YouTube channel called \"The Strive to Fit.\" She started her channel when she was in medical school and continues to film herself studying while in residency. Unlike The Man Sitting Next to Me, Jamie's \"study with me\" videos are prerecorded. Her videos range from around 20 minutes to two-and-a-half hours in length, and some have over two million views.\n\nShe offers videos with music and some with the natural sounds of the pencil on paper as a sort of ASMR.\n\nJamie: I try to cater to different types of audiences. It'll just be kind of the natural sound of like, pen and paper or book sounds and things like that.\n\nNarrator: With a quick YouTube search, you can find all sorts of different people and types of study videos to choose from. This study video trend is a lot like mukbang, which has become more popular in recent years. It involves people eating food, often a whole lot of it, on camera.\n\nLooking at what's on YouTube these days, like ASMR, mukbang, and reaction videos, it would seem like you don't need a whole lot of special skills to be a success. But gongbang serves a real purpose, helping people focus. Or at least that's what the content creator and the fans are saying.\n\nWhile it may seem distracting to watch YouTube while doing your work, they say it actually is a helpful way to avoid distractions.\n\nThe Man Sitting Next to Me: The first benefit my viewers can get is motivation. By watching other people studying, they can also get motivated to study hard. And for myself, by studying with all of you, I can prevent myself from getting lazy and continue to focus with my study.\n\nNarrator: And based on some of the comments, this method seems to be working.\n\n\"I'm an engineering student, a week ago I wasn't motivated at all, then I found your channel. Thank you for saving me.\"\n\n\"I feel more concentrated on my exam preparation. Thank you Jamie for your video. It's actually very nice and helpful.\"\n\nJamie: It really helps them focus, because every time they're tempted to do something on their phone or go somewhere on their website, they kinda look up and see that I'm still studying on the screen, so it kind of motivates them to keep studying and stay focused on what they're supposed to be doing.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#YouTube #Study #INSIDER\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

It'll just be kind of the natural sound of like, pen and paper or book sounds and things like that.\n\nNarrator: With a quick YouTube search, you can find all sorts of different people and types of study videos to choose from. This study video trend is a lot like mukbang, which has become more popular in recent years. It involves people eating food, often a whole lot of it, on camera.\n\nLooking at what's on YouTube these days, like ASMR, mukbang, and reaction videos, it would seem like you don't need a whole lot of special skills to be a success. But gongbang serves a real purpose, helping people focus. Or at least that's what the content creator and the fans are saying.\n\nWhile it may seem distracting to watch YouTube while doing your work, they say it actually is a helpful way to avoid distractions.\n\nThe Man Sitting Next to Me: The first benefit my viewers can get is motivation. By watching other people studying, they can also get motivated to study hard. And for myself, by studying with all of you, I can prevent myself from getting lazy and continue to focus with my study.\n\nNarrator: And based on some of the comments, this method seems to be working.\n\n\"I'm an engineering student, a week ago I wasn't motivated at all, then I found your channel. Thank you for saving me.\"\n\n\"I feel more concentrated on my exam preparation. Thank you Jamie for your video. It's actually very nice and helpful.\"\n\nJamie: It really helps them focus, because every time they're tempted to do something on their phone or go somewhere on their website, they kinda look up and see that I'm still studying on the screen, so it kind of motivates them to keep studying and stay focused on what they're supposed to be doing.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#YouTube #Study #INSIDER\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "channelId": "UCHJuQZuzapBh-CuhRYxIZrg",
                "description": "Commercial DNA tests have been a huge trend lately. However, my dad's family already has a detailed record of their ancestry. If a DNA test is truly accurate, he says it will classify me as heavily African and partly Asian. I took the 23andMe and Helix DNA tests to determine whether they'd confirm my dad's account and if so, to see which test would be more accurate.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nManny: Commercial DNA tests have been a huge trend lately. They were some of the most popular holiday gifts last year. Which makes sense, there's so much excitement in learning more about yourself. Some tests can shed light on health risks you might have, but the main ones tell you the composition of your ancestry.\n\nHabtay Ocbazghi: It looks like DNA is helpful to trace your origin, but for me, I already know my origins.\n\nManny: That's my dad, he's very proud of me because I'm doing great things in life.\n\nClip: Manny: Chicken number one kills chicken number two in this competition.H\n\nabtay: I was born in Eritrea. Eritrea is located in Northeast Africa.\n\nManny: His family kept a detailed record of their ancestors so that they would never forget where they came from.\n\nHabtay: Up to the sixth generation, I know even where they are buried and where they used to have their farm lands. Some people crossed from Asia and people stayed in Africa. They lived together during war, during peace, and they intermarried.\n\nManny: I wonder though, could this be more accurate than a DNA test?\n\nHabtay: I'm not that familiar with DNA but if it tells the origins of humans, your DNA will classify you as heavily African and partly Asian.\n\nManny: Let's find out! I ordered two DNA tests - the Helix test from National Geographic and 23andMe. Unboxing the tests was kind of exciting. They were neat and they had simple instructions. Generating enough spit was a challenge and I'm so sorry you have to watch this. A few weeks later...\n\nLet's start with National Geographic's Helix test. The results classify me as East African. It says that 62% of my DNA can be traced to the continent of Africa and 36% can be traced to Asia. This is in line with what my dad predicted, but I'm a little skeptical that my Asian ancestry is so prominent.\n\nHelix also noted that 2% of my DNA could be traced back to Europe. Specifically, the West Mediterranean. This region does include Italy, which did occupy parts of the Horn of Africa in the 1800's. Which could explain part of that 2%.\n\nOne thing that struck me about the Helix test was its description of East Africa. It tells me that my ancestry is associated with the birthplace of humankind, as well as the departure point for human migration out of Africa. This made me feel like a key part of human history. If only this ancestral journey didn't lead to a man who spends hours making SpongeBob memes.\n\nNow let's look at the 23andMe test. 94.6% Eritrean, Ethiopian. 2.4% Sudanese and 0.3% Broadly South Asian. This test puts much more emphasis on my African ancestry and a lot less on my Asian ancestry. There was also no mention of any European ancestry. This makes a lot more sense to me, but I wonder how two separate DNA tests can produce such different results. \n\nRobin Smith: So we take your DNA and compare you to reference data sets from around the world.\n\nManny: Robin Smith is 23andMe's Group Product Manager. To find out your ancestry, DNA tests compare your DNA with DNA from people around the world.

                    "title": "How Accurate Are DNA Tests?",
                    "description": "Commercial DNA tests have been a huge trend lately. However, my dad's family already has a detailed record of their ancestry. If a DNA test is truly accurate, he says it will classify me as heavily African and partly Asian. I took the 23andMe and Helix DNA tests to determine whether they'd confirm my dad's account and if so, to see which test would be more accurate.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video:\n\nManny: Commercial DNA tests have been a huge trend lately. They were some of the most popular holiday gifts last year. Which makes sense, there's so much excitement in learning more about yourself. Some tests can shed light on health risks you might have, but the main ones tell you the composition of your ancestry.\n\nHabtay Ocbazghi: It looks like DNA is helpful to trace your origin, but for me, I already know my origins.\n\nManny: That's my dad, he's very proud of me because I'm doing great things in life.\n\nClip: Manny: Chicken number one kills chicken number two in this competition.H\n\nabtay: I was born in Eritrea. Eritrea is located in Northeast Africa.\n\nManny: His family kept a detailed record of their ancestors so that they would never forget where they came from.\n\nHabtay: Up to the sixth generation, I know even where they are buried and where they used to have their farm lands. Some people crossed from Asia and people stayed in Africa. They lived together during war, during peace, and they intermarried.\n\nManny: I wonder though, could this be more accurate than a DNA test?\n\nHabtay: I'm not that familiar with DNA but if it tells the origins of humans, your DNA will classify you as heavily African and partly Asian.\n\nManny: Let's find out! I ordered two DNA tests - the Helix test from National Geographic and 23andMe. Unboxing the tests was kind of exciting. They were neat and they had simple instructions. Generating enough spit was a challenge and I'm so sorry you have to watch this. A few weeks later...\n\nLet's start with National Geographic's Helix test. The results classify me as East African. It says that 62% of my DNA can be traced to the continent of Africa and 36% can be traced to Asia. This is in line with what my dad predicted, but I'm a little skeptical that my Asian ancestry is so prominent.\n\nHelix also noted that 2% of my DNA could be traced back to Europe. Specifically, the West Mediterranean. This region does include Italy, which did occupy parts of the Horn of Africa in the 1800's. Which could explain part of that 2%.\n\nOne thing that struck me about the Helix test was its description of East Africa. It tells me that my ancestry is associated with the birthplace of humankind, as well as the departure point for human migration out of Africa. This made me feel like a key part of human history. If only this ancestral journey didn't lead to a man who spends hours making SpongeBob memes.\n\nNow let's look at the 23andMe test. 94.6% Eritrean, Ethiopian. 2.4% Sudanese and 0.3% Broadly South Asian. This test puts much more emphasis on my African ancestry and a lot less on my Asian ancestry. There was also no mention of any European ancestry. This makes a lot more sense to me, but I wonder how two separate DNA tests can produce such different results. \n\nRobin Smith: So we take your DNA and compare you to reference data sets from around the world.\n\nManny: Robin Smith is 23andMe's Group Product Manager. To find out your ancestry, DNA tests compare your DNA with DNA from people around the world. And depending on the company, these reference data sets can vary. \n\nSmith: Seeing your results here, it looks like Ethiopian and Eritrean so that's a group for which, you know, maybe a few years ago we wouldn't have had much of a data set but now because of our size we got a lot of data from that region so we're able to provide very good granularity there.\n\nManny: Some regions of the world aren't as represented as others in these reference data sets, leading to some disappointingly vague results for some customers. Thankfully my DNA tests were pretty accurate, but at the end of the day, they just confirmed what my dad already knew.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#DNA #Ancestry #INSIDER\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "title": "Why Is Duct Tape So Strong?",
                "channelId": "UCHJuQZuzapBh-CuhRYxIZrg",
                "description": "Duct tapes were first invented by a female factory worker during World War II. They were originally called 'duck' tape because it was made out of a cotton duck fabric and it repelled water like a duck's back.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nNarrator: Duct tape can hold just about anything together. We use it for all sorts of repairs and even as a decorative addition to various arts and crafts. But what makes duct tape so strong and versatile? And is it duct tape or duck tape? The tape was originally called duck tape because of its water-resistant qualities. It repelled water like a duck's back, and it used to be made out of a cotton duck fabric without any adhesive layers. But cotton duck fabric doesn't actually come from ducks. This is what it looks like. It's a strong fabric made from cotton, where the threads make a crisscross pattern. Known for being a strong material, the fabric was used to protect power cables and electrical conductors from corrosion. But the adhesive duct tape we know and love today didn't appear until World War II. A factory worker who was packaging ammunition sealed each box with tape and wax to make them waterproof. When the worker, Vesta Stout, saw soldiers struggling to open the boxes, she came up with an idea to seal the boxes with a strong, cloth-based, waterproof tape. Stout wrote a letter to FDR about her solution and a few weeks later, received word from the War Production Board that Johnson and Johnson would be manufacturing the tape. The tape became a military sensation. It was durable and easy to apply and remove by hand. After the war ended, duct tape turned up in hardware stores ready to help Americans with household repairs, too. It quickly became a useful tool for wrapping air ducts, which led to its other name, duct tape.\n\nAshley Luke: Duct tape used to be kind of a one-and-done silver tape that was essentially used for repairs. Our adhesive is specifically formulated to stick to a whole variety of different surfaces, and then basically the waterproof backing on top of that then protects the adhesive once it's applied to a surface.\n\nNarrator: There are three main components that go into making the tape. Rubber for the adhesive, cloth, and backing. The rubber comes from rubber trees and arrives at the factory in large bales. A machine mixes the raw rubber along with various sticky resins until it reaches the consistency of pizza dough. Then, the mixture is heated to over 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Now the adhesive is ready to be added to the cloth and the backing. The cloth, sometimes called the scrim, lies in between the sticky rubber layer and that ubiquitous silver backing. It's made from cotton and is a key part of the tape. The cloth is what gives the tape its tensile strength. It makes it easy to hand tear and keeps the tape stuck to a surface once it's laid down. Finally, there's the backing. The backing is made from polyethylene, the same plastic material used to make bags and shampoo bottles. Once the backing is ready, all of the materials are put together.\n\nAshley Luke: So there's basically two ways that the backing can be incorporated into the tape: either laminated or co-extrusion. The co-extrusion basically melds together the backing, the cloth, and then the adhesive. So it gives you a stronger tape that won't delaminate. It's gonna be really good in different weather applications.\n\nNarrator: Once the layers are combined, the strength of the cloth and the plastic-like nature of the backing combine to give the tape the strength and durability we know and love. The tape comes out in one jumbo roll that weighs over a ton. Each giant roll can produce over 30,000 small rolls. To get it to a smaller size, the roll is sliced into strips. Then, the smaller tape strips are put into cores and rerolled. Finally, the tapes are placed in their final packaging, sent down the conveyor belt, and put into boxes for shipment. Since its debut, duct tape has exploded in popularity. Today, we use it to make flowers, bags, wallets, science projects, and various DIY crafts. Unlike your masking tapes, scotch tapes, painter's tape, and other single-use tapes, duct tape has a long history of being used for just about anything. By simply putting fabric and adhesive together, Vesta Stout may have created one of the most useful and strongest inventions we have today.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                    "title": "Why Is Duct Tape So Strong?",
                    "description": "Duct tapes were first invented by a female factory worker during World War II. They were originally called 'duck' tape because it was made out of a cotton duck fabric and it repelled water like a duck's back.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nNarrator: Duct tape can hold just about anything together. We use it for all sorts of repairs and even as a decorative addition to various arts and crafts. But what makes duct tape so strong and versatile? And is it duct tape or duck tape? The tape was originally called duck tape because of its water-resistant qualities. It repelled water like a duck's back, and it used to be made out of a cotton duck fabric without any adhesive layers. But cotton duck fabric doesn't actually come from ducks. This is what it looks like. It's a strong fabric made from cotton, where the threads make a crisscross pattern. Known for being a strong material, the fabric was used to protect power cables and electrical conductors from corrosion. But the adhesive duct tape we know and love today didn't appear until World War II. A factory worker who was packaging ammunition sealed each box with tape and wax to make them waterproof. When the worker, Vesta Stout, saw soldiers struggling to open the boxes, she came up with an idea to seal the boxes with a strong, cloth-based, waterproof tape.

                "description": "DJ, producer, and founder of Fool's Gold Records, A-Trak has been DJing for over 20 years. In 1997, he was the world champion of DJing at age 15 before going on to become Kanye West's touring DJ and founding his own record label. Beginning in 2017, he's organized the Goldie Awards, a DJ competition and beat battle for DJs and producers to demonstrate their skills.\u00a0In this interview, A-Trak explains that the role of the DJ isn't just to press a play button. It's to control the crowd's energy by selecting the perfect tracks to play at the right time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

The science of DJing, if you try to boil it down too much to a simple description of beatmatching, for example, definitely like an intangible to it. On a very simple level, beatmatching is what you call matching the tempo of one song to the next song that's playing so that you have a continuous beat. And just going back to the basic idea that DJs keep people dancing. You're able to keep the tempo steady as you go from song to song.\n\nIt's actually a pretty easy technique, but DJing itself is not that easy and I think the real role of the DJ is selection, it's picking songs and having a sense of what to play and when. And that's the part that's harder to break down or explain. What really differentiates a good DJ from a not so good DJ is selection and taste and sense of timing and also knowing how to adapt to different crowds. That's probably the biggest thing that DJs have to learn is to understand not only what to play and when but in which setting. You can't play the same set everywhere.\n\nElectronic music's been around since the late '70s, early '80s. So electronic music isn't new but EDM is this newer, bigger, more polished manifestation of it. And when it really broke in America, at the beginning of this decade, it's also when certain songs were really bona fide pop songs, and were playing on the radio. New audiences embraced these big records that had a universal appeal, and by the same token embraced the producers and DJs who were behind those records. More and more of these festivals started popping up. I think that confused a lot of people. Just seeing a DJ essentially play songs that were already made, on the stage where they'd be used to seeing the Red Hot Chili Peppers or something.\n\nPeople were questioning whether DJs were really just pressing play and that became a bit of a buzzword, \"pressing play\" or \"button pusher.\" The range of different styles that started existing got almost too big to just categorize as one thing. So, do some DJs just go up and press play and phone in the same set at a lot of events? Yeah. Does that mean that all DJs do that, no. A lot of DJs have true craftsmanship and art to what they do.\n\nUsually the argument that most people will give and that I was just giving also is that DJs don't really play the same set everywhere and we're mixing live and all this stuff. But in some cases when the show is so big, that you get into a place where there actually is literally pyro and effects that need to be timed and this and that, then you'll have a DJ who plans their set. But even that to me, can be compared to theater. When you go watch theater, it's pre-planned but it's great entertainment. In the case of a DJ, the DJ is doing a sort of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, of songs that they know the crowd will enjoy hearing. And songs that they are sometimes connected to or that they made. And translating that into a show that will work in front of 60,000 people. There's an art to that too. The control of energy is kind of magical and undeniable. And that's a big part of the art too. So between that and the sort of sonic wizardry that happens with the knobs on here, it definitely isn't something to be diminished.",

                    "description": "DJ, producer, and founder of Fool's Gold Records, A-Trak has been DJing for over 20 years. In 1997, he was the world champion of DJing at age 15 before going on to become Kanye West's touring DJ and founding his own record label. Beginning in 2017, he's organized the Goldie Awards, a DJ competition and beat battle for DJs and producers to demonstrate their skills.\u00a0In this interview, A-Trak explains that the role of the DJ isn't just to press a play button. It's to control the crowd's energy by selecting the perfect tracks to play at the right time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

The science of DJing, if you try to boil it down too much to a simple description of beatmatching, for example, definitely like an intangible to it. On a very simple level, beatmatching is what you call matching the tempo of one song to the next song that's playing so that you have a continuous beat. And just going back to the basic idea that DJs keep people dancing. You're able to keep the tempo steady as you go from song to song.\n\nIt's actually a pretty easy technique, but DJing itself is not that easy and I think the real role of the DJ is selection, it's picking songs and having a sense of what to play and when. And that's the part that's harder to break down or explain. What really differentiates a good DJ from a not so good DJ is selection and taste and sense of timing and also knowing how to adapt to different crowds. That's probably the biggest thing that DJs have to learn is to understand not only what to play and when but in which setting. You can't play the same set everywhere.\n\nElectronic music's been around since the late '70s, early '80s. So electronic music isn't new but EDM is this newer, bigger, more polished manifestation of it. And when it really broke in America, at the beginning of this decade, it's also when certain songs were really bona fide pop songs, and were playing on the radio. New audiences embraced these big records that had a universal appeal, and by the same token embraced the producers and DJs who were behind those records. More and more of these festivals started popping up. I think that confused a lot of people. Just seeing a DJ essentially play songs that were already made, on the stage where they'd be used to seeing the Red Hot Chili Peppers or something.\n\nPeople were questioning whether DJs were really just pressing play and that became a bit of a buzzword, \"pressing play\" or \"button pusher.\" The range of different styles that started existing got almost too big to just categorize as one thing. So, do some DJs just go up and press play and phone in the same set at a lot of events? Yeah. Does that mean that all DJs do that, no. A lot of DJs have true craftsmanship and art to what they do.\n\nUsually the argument that most people will give and that I was just giving also is that DJs don't really play the same set everywhere and we're mixing live and all this stuff. But in some cases when the show is so big, that you get into a place where there actually is literally pyro and effects that need to be timed and this and that, then you'll have a DJ who plans their set. But even that to me, can be compared to theater. When you go watch theater, it's pre-planned but it's great entertainment. In the case of a DJ, the DJ is doing a sort of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, of songs that they know the crowd will enjoy hearing. And songs that they are sometimes connected to or that they made. And translating that into a show that will work in front of 60,000 people. There's an art to that too. The control of energy is kind of magical and undeniable. And that's a big part of the art too. So between that and the sort of sonic wizardry that happens with the knobs on here, it definitely isn't something to be diminished."

By layering the sounds of many animals, they can create the sound of a whole new creature. \n\nThe INSIDER team believes that life is an adventure!

And none can stop me! So, how does Hollywood know how to make them sound? \nDaenerys: Dracarys! \nNarrator:\u00a0Just like visual artists, sound designers take inspiration from the world around them. The sounds for creatures like dragons, dinosaurs, and even Chewbacca are based on real-world animals. A sound designer may use sounds from lions, elephants, cats, and even tortoises to create the sound for just one dragon. They'll layer sounds together to create the sound of a non-existent creature. \nPaula Fairfield:\u00a0So, my dogs are in the second episode of season five. There's a scene that's very intimate and you hear these like beautiful little nasal whistles. Okay, that was my dog, Angel. She's in a lot of Drogon's stuff and obviously in the wolves. So, I took that sound and put it in there. \nNarrator:\u00a0Paula Fairfield is a sound designer for \"Game of Thrones.\" Over the last five seasons, Paula has carefully crafted the sounds of Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. She even used the vocal screams of fans to create the sound generated by Viserion's icy breath in the season seven finale. The final sound design of a scene is complex. It masks the individual sound effects so the viewer can't identify the sources. But, we can build our own simplified version of a dragon's sound. Combine some alligator, a little elephant, horse, add a pig and you've got the sound of a dragon. But, these are complex creatures. Dragons do more than just roar and breathe fire. Sound designers also use sound to craft a performance for the dragon. Just like Daenerys, Drogon needs to act and perform. Sound designers take emotional cues from animals to influence the sounds they create. \nPaula Fairfield:\u00a0I was really proud of the fact that you can always hear from the time he was, you know, a toddler to now you can hear the essence of him in his voice. You recognize him as Drogon. And I see them as like your puppy dog. I mean, we have grown up with these puppy dragons in our world, right? And, I think that's why there is so much love for them. I've tried to bring my love of that into the show. \nNarrator:\u00a0Each dragon is unique and sound designers are always trying something new. In \"The Hobbit,\" director Peter Jackson used Benedict Cumberbatch's original performance as Smaug to influence the sound design of the dragon. Many of the pauses, hisses, and vocal affectations came from Cumberbatch. \nSmaug:\u00a0So, tell me, thief, how do you choose to die? \nNarrator:\u00a0These details help make Smaug incredibly impactful and memorable. And, in the \"How to Train Your Dragon\" series, sound designer Randy Thom used different types of sounds for each species of dragon giving each type of creature their own unique sound. Dragons and other fantastical creatures add a larger-than-life element to stories. The most memorable dragons leave space for the sound to have an emotional effect on the viewer. Without the incredible sound design, \"Game of Thrones\" and \"How To Train Your Dragon\" may not be as memorable. \nDaenerys:\u00a0They're beautiful aren't they? \nJon: Wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, but yes, they are.\n\nHow Dragon Sound Effects Are Made | Movies Insider",

By layering the sounds of many animals, they can create the sound of a whole new creature. \n\nThe INSIDER team believes that life is an adventure!

And none can stop me! So, how does Hollywood know how to make them sound? \nDaenerys: Dracarys! \nNarrator:\u00a0Just like visual artists, sound designers take inspiration from the world around them. The sounds for creatures like dragons, dinosaurs, and even Chewbacca are based on real-world animals. A sound designer may use sounds from lions, elephants, cats, and even tortoises to create the sound for just one dragon. They'll layer sounds together to create the sound of a non-existent creature. \nPaula Fairfield:\u00a0So, my dogs are in the second episode of season five. There's a scene that's very intimate and you hear these like beautiful little nasal whistles. Okay, that was my dog, Angel. She's in a lot of Drogon's stuff and obviously in the wolves. So, I took that sound and put it in there. \nNarrator:\u00a0Paula Fairfield is a sound designer for \"Game of Thrones.\" Over the last five seasons, Paula has carefully crafted the sounds of Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. She even used the vocal screams of fans to create the sound generated by Viserion's icy breath in the season seven finale. The final sound design of a scene is complex. It masks the individual sound effects so the viewer can't identify the sources. But, we can build our own simplified version of a dragon's sound. Combine some alligator, a little elephant, horse, add a pig and you've got the sound of a dragon. But, these are complex creatures. Dragons do more than just roar and breathe fire. Sound designers also use sound to craft a performance for the dragon. Just like Daenerys, Drogon needs to act and perform.

He's worked with her for years and he's been dancing his entire life.\n\nKnight: I remember dancing in my grandmother's living room. And then when I was 16, I started my own dance group with my best friend in Atlanta. So that was kinda the first serious step towards choreography and creative direction.\n\nNarrator: At just 18, JaQuel landed a gig choreographing one of the best videos of all time, \"Single Ladies.\" Years later, JaQuel reveals what it takes to be a backup dancer for Beyonce.\n\nKnight: To work for B as a dancer, it takes everything, you know. She's a southern girl, you know, who's worked very hard to get where she is. So she want people to do the same. She wanna know that you want it really bad. She wanna see your heart, your passion, your drive. And then, you know, you gotta be able to jam. How greasy can you get? How can you hit it hard? Then there's also the side of her that's looking for the technical element. You know, are you trained? Do you have any ballet training? Do you have any jazz training? How are your lines? You know, so there's a few things that go into the process.\n\nAnd once we start to audition things, you know, we look for everything. We teach them hip-hop number, we teach them a super difficult technical number, we teach them the classic Beyonc\u00e9 number, you know. And then besides that, you know, you gotta be able to carry the stage, you know, with her. You gotta be able to stand next to her and be just as good, you know. And sometimes people are ready, sometimes they're not. You can be a great dancer, but it may not come through when you get on stage. You may kind of pull into a shell, don't know who to look at. So she's looking for stars. Star dancers, who have magic. That can bring it, you know, and pull other people in, always.\n\nWorking with B during the rehearsal process is like, it's kind of a out of body experience, ya know. People don't understand the amount of effort her work ethic is out of this world. And it's never just one thing. When we're creating choreography, it's okay, boom. Where's the wardrobe at? You know, bring them in so they can see what the choreography is. Okay boom. Where are we on this stage? You know, let's make sure lighting knows how to light this, boom. Where are the cameras? Okay, let's look at this camera and then do this.\n\nYou know, we're always thinking of every single piece of the puzzle. But you know, at the end of the day, we send her pictures, we send her videos. She's watching people in rehearsal like who's that? Okay, that's so and so that we talked about. She's like okay, she's good. You know, she's looking at everything at every moment, you know. So she's like heavily involved.",

                "description": "Breast cancer survivors are getting mastectomy tattoos to decorate their surgical scars. These tattoos come in several forms, and women choose them for specific reasons. One of the tattoos, 3D areola repigmentation, is done on non-reconstructed nipples to create a life-like replication of nipples. Other women decorate their scars with illustrative tattoos to express their identities and the battles they went through to survive the disease.\n\nOne tattoo artist who is helping empower survivors is Friday Jones. She serves as a board member of P.ink, an organization that connects breast cancer survivors with tattoo artists.\n\n2:25 -- Art by @shanewallintattoo, @mastectomytattoo.

                    "description": "Breast cancer survivors are getting mastectomy tattoos to decorate their surgical scars. These tattoos come in several forms, and women choose them for specific reasons. One of the tattoos, 3D areola repigmentation, is done on non-reconstructed nipples to create a life-like replication of nipples. Other women decorate their scars with illustrative tattoos to express their identities and the battles they went through to survive the disease.\n\nOne tattoo artist who is helping empower survivors is Friday Jones. She serves as a board member of P.ink, an organization that connects breast cancer survivors with tattoo artists.\n\n2:25 -- Art by @shanewallintattoo, @mastectomytattoo.
