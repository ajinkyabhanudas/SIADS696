Her and her friends enjoyed the off-season and slow travel bliss with virtually private access to otherwise crowded sites. She believes that the time she\u2019s spent on road trips, chasing the warm yellow tones of sunset and sunrise, has given her ownership over how she faces challenges in life, particularly when learning how to navigate a Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis. Resisting the temptation to withdraw from her life out of fear, she remained inspired by the beauty and healing power of nature\u2014a constant force to which many of us are turning for reassurance in 2020.\n\nWant to learn more about Arizona?

Welcome to Yellowstone, the grandfather of all national parks.\n\nWe hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. \n\nMore travel information around Yellowstone National Park: https://www.expedia.com/Yellowstone-National-Park.dx6130056\n\nSubscribe to Expedia\u2019s YouTube Channel for great travel videos and join the conversation on the best vacation ideas. \n\n---------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Expedia\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/expedia\n\n---------\n\n0:00 - Yellowstone National Park\n2:03 - Grand Prismatic spring\n2:31 - Old Faithful\n3:16 - Yellowstone Lake\n3:38 - Hayden Valley\n4:17 - Yellowstone River & Grand Canyon of Yellowstone\n4:35 - Artist Point\n5:14 - Pebble Creek\n5:30 - Lamar Valley\n5:58 - Gardiner\n6:20 - Mammoth Hot Springs\n6:54 - Norris\n7:01 - Artists' Paintpots"

See why this special destination captured the hearts of all those involved in the crafting of this video. \n\nWant to know what goes into creating one of the Expedia Vacation Travel Guide videos? Check out how we made the Jordan Vacation Travel Guide here: https://viewfinder.expedia.com/jordan-video-behind-the-scenes/\n\nCheck out all the places we visited in this video: https://viewfinder.expedia.com/jordan-vacation-ideas-planning-itinerary-travel-video/\n\nWhen ready, browse vacation packages to Jordan: https://www.expedia.com/Jordan.d90.Destination-Travel-Guides\n\nFrom epic landscapes to monumental ruins, #Jordan allows us to reach out and touch the eternal and be at one with something far greater than ourselves.\n\nThe ancient Greeks knew Jordan\u2019s capital, Amman, as Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Overlooking Amman is the Citadel, the city\u2019s ancient core. Rising over the Citadel are the remaining pillars of the Temple of Hercules, a Roman temple that in its day dwarfed many in Ancient Rome.  \n\nFrom Amman, #journey north to Jerash, home to one of the largest concentrations of Roman ruins outside Italy. Then, continue north to Ajloun Castle, built to halt the Crusader armies as they rode down Jordan\u2019s northern valley, hell-bent on Jerusalem.\n\nEnter the gravel plains of the Eastern Desert and follow the Desert Castle Loop. For many, the highlight here is Qasr al-Azraq, where Lawrence of Arabia made his winter headquarters. \n\nTravel south to Madaba, famed for the Madaba Map, one of the earliest depictions of the Holy Lands. Continue south along the Kings Highway, which once took Arabs to Mecca, and Israelites to the Promised Land. \n\nFollow the hairpin road 1300 feet below sea level to the Dead Sea. Float in the saline waters and cover yourself in the same mineral-rich muds Cleopatra once enjoyed. \n\nNo visit to Jordan is complete without a visit to Petra. Emerge from the shadows of the Siq and gaze up at the Treasury, the greatest of all of Petra\u2019s 500 tombs. Then continue south to explore the emptiness of Wadi Rum. \n\nFor now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. \n\nMore travel information around Jordan: https://www.expedia.com/Jordan.dx90\n\nSubscribe to Expedia\u2019s YouTube Channel for great travel videos and join the conversation on the best vacation ideas. \n\n---------\n\nFollow us on social media: \nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Expedia\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/expedia\n\n---------\n\n0:00 - Jordan\n1:30 - Amman \n1:47 - Citadel\n1:58 - The Temple of Hercules\n2:32 - Roman Theatre \n2:48 - Amman\u2019s Museums and Galleries\n3:00 - The Royal Automobile Museum\n3:17 - Duke of Mukhyber\u2019s Residence\n4:11 - Jerash\n5:10 - South Theatre\n5:26 - Oval Forum\n5:44 - Cardo Maximus \n6:32 - Temple of Artemis \n7:00 - Ajloun Castle\n7:35 - Pella\n7:56 - Eastern Desert\n8:08 - Qasr Kharana\n8:25 - Qusayr Amra\n8:53 - Qasr al-Azraq\n9:26 - Madaba\n10:10 - King\u2019s Highway\n10:26 - Mount Nebo\n10:50 - The Dead Sea\n11:42 - Wadi Mujib\n12:19 - Petra\n12:47 - The Treasury\n14:20 - Wadi Rum",

                    "description": "Epic history, thundering landscapes and ancient artefacts await in Jordan. See why this special destination captured the hearts of all those involved in the crafting of this video. \n\nWant to know what goes into creating one of the Expedia Vacation Travel Guide videos? Check out how we made the Jordan Vacation Travel Guide here: https://viewfinder.expedia.com/jordan-video-behind-the-scenes/\n\nCheck out all the places we visited in this video: https://viewfinder.expedia.com/jordan-vacation-ideas-planning-itinerary-travel-video/\n\nWhen ready, browse vacation packages to Jordan: https://www.expedia.com/Jordan.d90.Destination-Travel-Guides\n\nFrom epic landscapes to monumental ruins, #Jordan allows us to reach out and touch the eternal and be at one with something far greater than ourselves.\n\nThe ancient Greeks knew Jordan\u2019s capital, Amman, as Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Overlooking Amman is the Citadel, the city\u2019s ancient core. Rising over the Citadel are the remaining pillars of the Temple of Hercules, a Roman temple that in its day dwarfed many in Ancient Rome.  \n\nFrom Amman, #journey north to Jerash, home to one of the largest concentrations of Roman ruins outside Italy. Then, continue north to Ajloun Castle, built to halt the Crusader armies as they rode down Jordan\u2019s northern valley, hell-bent on Jerusalem.\n\nEnter the gravel plains of the Eastern Desert and follow the Desert Castle Loop. For many, the highlight here is Qasr al-Azraq, where Lawrence of Arabia made his winter headquarters. \n\nTravel south to Madaba, famed for the Madaba Map, one of the earliest depictions of the Holy Lands. Continue south along the Kings Highway, which once took Arabs to Mecca, and Israelites to the Promised Land. \n\nFollow the hairpin road 1300 feet below sea level to the Dead Sea. Float in the saline waters and cover yourself in the same mineral-rich muds Cleopatra once enjoyed. \n\nNo visit to Jordan is complete without a visit to Petra. Emerge from the shadows of the Siq and gaze up at the Treasury, the greatest of all of Petra\u2019s 500 tombs. Then continue south to explore the emptiness of Wadi Rum. \n\nFor now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. \n\nMore travel information around Jordan: https://www.expedia.com/Jordan.dx90\n\nSubscribe to Expedia\u2019s YouTube Channel for great travel videos and join the conversation on the best vacation ideas. \n\n---------\n\nFollow us on social media: \nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Expedia\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/expedia\n\n---------\n\n0:00 - Jordan\n1:30 - Amman \n1:47 - Citadel\n1:58 - The Temple of Hercules\n2:32 - Roman Theatre \n2:48 - Amman\u2019s Museums and Galleries\n3:00 - The Royal Automobile Museum\n3:17 - Duke of Mukhyber\u2019s Residence\n4:11 - Jerash\n5:10 - South Theatre\n5:26 - Oval Forum\n5:44 - Cardo Maximus \n6:32 - Temple of Artemis \n7:00 - Ajloun Castle\n7:35 - Pella\n7:56 - Eastern Desert\n8:08 - Qasr Kharana\n8:25 - Qusayr Amra\n8:53 - Qasr al-Azraq\n9:26 - Madaba\n10:10 - King\u2019s Highway\n10:26 - Mount Nebo\n10:50 - The Dead Sea\n11:42 - Wadi Mujib\n12:19 - Petra\n12:47 - The Treasury\n14:20 - Wadi Rum"

Check out the coolest spots to explore in this Argentine city. \n\nWhen ready, browse vacation packages to Mendoza: https://www.expedia.com/Mendoza-Wine-Region.d6054200.Destination-Travel-Guides\n\n\u00a1Bienvenidos a Mendoza! \n\nFind #Mendoza at the foot of the Andes and let your #vacation experience roll out through the lush gardens, tree-lined streets and open plazas that drive the city\u2019s culture and heartbeat. \n\nThis part of Argentina is great to #visit year-round given its seemingly-endless sunshine. Located on an arid plateau, Mendoza was built on the irrigation channels that were originally dug by the indigenous Huarpe people. These waterways also feed snowmelt from the Andes to Mendoza's vineyards. Mendoza is one of the most highly renowned wine regions in the world.\n\nFrom above, key Mendoza parks take on the shape of a dotted number five, like on dice. #Explore the central dot, leafy Plaza Independencia and its underground modern art museum. The corners are formed by the Plaza Italia, Plaza General San Mart\u00edn, Plaza Espa\u00f1a and Plaza Chile, with their richly decorated statues and fountains.\n\nFor now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. \n\nMore travel information around Mendoza: https://www.expedia.com/Mendoza-Wine-Region.dx6054200\u00a0\n\n---------\n\nFollow us on social media: \nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Expedia\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/expedia\n\n---------\n\n0:00 - Mendoza\n1:44 - Bodega Lagarde\n2:11 - Catena Zapata\n2:23 - Parque General San Martin\n2:53 - El Cerro de la Gloria\n3:16 - Teatro Independencia \n3:26 - Espacio Contempor\u00e1neo de Arte\n3:46 - Plaza Independencia \n4:28 - Plaza Italia"

                "description": "When booking a cruise, it\u2019s natural think about which ports you\u2019ll visit along the way. But what about sea days? They are the time to unwind, let loose and really enjoy the ship. And when you\u2019re sailing on Disney Cruise Line, you\u2019ll want lots of time to take in everything there is to do onboard. Here are some of our favorite ways to maximize days at sea. Plan your cruise: http://bit.ly/1T5ovZ5\n\n1. Get some pool time\nNothing says vacation like pool time. Adults can visit the Quiet Cove pool which is exclusively for guests 18+. There is a pool bar, infinity edge hot tubs and plenty of lounge space. It\u2019s great for when your kids are in the nursery or kids clubs. When it\u2019s time for the family to come back together, there are also two family-friendly pools, waterslides and water play areas for kids of all ages. And don\u2019t forget the AquaDuck! It\u2019s the first-of-its-kind water coaster at sea taking riders up, down, around and even off the side of the ship before splashing back on deck.\n\n2. Learn something new   \nA sea day is also a great time to learn something new. Disney Cruise Line offers everything from cooking demos, towel folding workshops, animation classes, fitness seminars, behind-the-scenes ship tours and more. Adults can get schooled on their favorite cocktails with tasting classes. Check the Disney Cruise Line Navigator app for a dialing listing of onboard activities. \n\n3. Day-time Entertainment\nThere\u2019s no shortage of planned activities on sea days. All of the youth clubs have scheduled fun under the care of specially trained Disney counselors. Even the nursery has activities for the little ones! Ever wanted to solve a mystery? The Midship Detective Agency allows you to do just that. This all-ages interactive adventure takes you all around the ship to solve cases with clues, technology and good old-fashioned intuition. You can also challenge yourself to some healthy competition with Disney trivia or get swept up in board game madness. You\u2019ll get so into the action that time will fly. \n\n4. Night-time Entertainment\nWhen nighttime comes, you can soak up the ambience at onboard entertainment venues. Piano bars let you revel in the sounds of live piano music. At the Skyline bar, you can travel the world in one night as the \u2018city views\u2019 change from one international destination to another. There are a myriad of other lounges that offer fun throughout the evening. At the end of the day, take a relaxing stroll around the upper decks and soak in the starlight and sea breezes. You may even meet some new friends along the way!\n\nWant to learn more about Disney Cruise Line? Watch the rest of our Expedia At Disney playlist on YouTube.

                "description": "Booking a cruise should be just as easy as sailing on one. Luckily, we\u2019ve made the planning process easy for you. On Expedia, you can search for cruises by destination, travel dates, trip length and more to find the sailing that works best for you. Plan your cruise: http://bit.ly/1T5ovZ5\n \nAfter you\u2019ve selected your destination and the dates you want to sail, it\u2019s time to pick your stateroom type. You can pick your exact stateroom on Expedia with a virtual map. Inside staterooms offer the best value, but lack exterior views. But on the Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy, inside staterooms feature a magical porthole which showcases real-time views of the sea and virtual sightings of animated Disney characters. Outside staterooms are also available, offering two portholes or one large porthole. Verandah staterooms, which offer private balconies, provide you with the ultimate setting to enjoy refreshing sea breezes. Premium suites are also available, which gives you the ultimate luxury. Many staterooms sleep up to 5 people. A fold-out couch and pull-down beds help maximize the space. Most staterooms also offer split bathrooms. One bathroom has a toilet and sink, while the other has a shower and sink. This makes it easy for larger parties to get ready in the morning. \n \nWhile counting down to your cruise, check out the Disney Cruise Line website to pre-book spa appointments, premium dining, port adventures and more. Once the planning is done, you don\u2019t have to worry about a thing onboard. From spending time with the ones you love to watching the only fireworks at sea, there are endless reasons to book a Disney Cruise. \n\nWant to learn more about Disney Cruise Line?

On Expedia, you can search for cruises by destination, travel dates, trip length and more to find the sailing that works best for you. Plan your cruise: http://bit.ly/1T5ovZ5\n \nAfter you\u2019ve selected your destination and the dates you want to sail, it\u2019s time to pick your stateroom type. You can pick your exact stateroom on Expedia with a virtual map. Inside staterooms offer the best value, but lack exterior views. But on the Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy, inside staterooms feature a magical porthole which showcases real-time views of the sea and virtual sightings of animated Disney characters. Outside staterooms are also available, offering two portholes or one large porthole. Verandah staterooms, which offer private balconies, provide you with the ultimate setting to enjoy refreshing sea breezes. Premium suites are also available, which gives you the ultimate luxury. Many staterooms sleep up to 5 people. A fold-out couch and pull-down beds help maximize the space. Most staterooms also offer split bathrooms. One bathroom has a toilet and sink, while the other has a shower and sink. This makes it easy for larger parties to get ready in the morning. \n \nWhile counting down to your cruise, check out the Disney Cruise Line website to pre-book spa appointments, premium dining, port adventures and more. Once the planning is done, you don\u2019t have to worry about a thing onboard. From spending time with the ones you love to watching the only fireworks at sea, there are endless reasons to book a Disney Cruise. \n\nWant to learn more about Disney Cruise Line?

But there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t stay ship shape as well. Here are the top 10 ways to stay healthy on a Disney cruise. Plan your cruise: http://bit.ly/1T5ovZ5\n\n1. Shuffleboard\nEnjoy a round of shuffleboard on the lower deck of the ship. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity to get away from the crowds and breathe in the fresh ocean air. \n\n2. Goofy\u2019s Sports Deck\nThis action-packed area allows guests of all ages to play a game of full-court basketball. Make sure to drink plenty of water in the heat!\n\n3. Jogging Track\nEach of the Disney ships offers a track for jogging and walking. Hint: 8 laps around the Disney Dream ship equals a 5k.\n\n4. Miniature Golf\nIf you don\u2019t want to break a series sweat, you can still stay active with a round of mini golf. The course is a prime location for watching the sunset too. \n\n5. Fitness Center\nThe gyms onboard Disney ships are state-of-the-art exercise clubs with spectacular ocean views. These adult-only facilities offer everything you need to work out while at sea. Choose from treadmills, weight machines, personal training and fitness classes. \n\n6. Spa\nTaking care of yourself on vacation also means taking time to unwind. Senses Spa offers a variety of treatment options. The Rainforest Room offers the benefits of steam, heat, water therapy and aromatherapy. \n\n5.

Check out our tips for taking advantage of activities and entertainment for all ages while sailing with Disney Cruise Line. Plan your cruise: http://bit.ly/1T5ovZ5\n\nAdults can start their day with a specialty coffee from Cove Caf\u00e9, one of the venues exclusive to guests who are 18+. This coffee shop offers mouth-watering drinks in a plush atmosphere. Afterwards, adults can hit the spa and get pampered with facials, massages, saunas, manicures, pedicures and more. Health nuts can even keep up with their fitness routines at the onboard gym. Or work up a sweat on the jogging track and sports deck. In the evening, adults can watch sports in the pub. Many of the lounges are open during the day, offering activities for all ages. But at night the clubs offer an adult exclusive evening of dancing, comedy, live piano music and more. Our favorite is La Piazza, a lounge inspired by Italy. It even offers a bar modeled after a vintage carousel.\n\nKids of all ages are welcome on a Disney Cruise. You\u2019re never too young to enjoy fun activities like daily toddler time play groups, the Aqualab water play area and the Wake Up with Disney Jr Dance Party. Also, having a nursery onboard means new parents can enjoy a little time to unwind and spend date nights together. Tweens even have their own space. If your kids are too cool for the kid\u2019s club, but not quite ready for the teen club, then they can spend time at Edge \u2013 the youth club designed just for tweens. \n\nGuests of all ages can enjoy the first-run movies at the onboard movie theater. And there\u2019s D Lounge, a family-friendly entertainment venue with karaoke, trivia, game shows and more. Last but not least, everyone can share over-the-top dinners and broadway style shows nightly.

                "description": "Everyone knows there\u2019s no shortage of food on a cruise. That\u2019s especially true when sailing with Disney Cruise Line. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not all pizza, hot dog and kiddie fare! Guests can enjoy upscale menu items crafted by Michelin star-rated chefs or wine pairings selected by master sommeliers. Out of all the options, here are some of our favorite dining experiences with Disney Cruise Line. Plan your cruise: http://bit.ly/1T5ovZ5\n\nSpecialty dining at Remy and Palo\nPetites assiettes means \u201csmall plates,\u201d and this gem is an experience offered at Remy, a French-inspired fine dining restaurant exclusively for adults. There are six dishes in all, each perfectly paired with wine. The Disney ships are also home to Palo, which is widely regarded as a favorite dining spot. This adult-only venue offers Italian cooking for brunch and dinner. The fan favorite here is the chocolate souffl\u00e9, but I think the views are equally scrumptious!\n\nRotating dining rooms\nWith Disney Cruise Line you don\u2019t simply dine in the same dining room every evening \u2013 you visit one of three uniquely themed family dining spaces each night. You might dine in an enhanted garden that transforms from day to night while you dine or enjoy South American flair at Cariocas. And then there\u2019s our favorite, Animator\u2019s Palate, where Disney characters come to life before your eyes. On the Disney magic and Disney fantasy you can even see your hand-drawn characters become part of the show!\n\nCasual dining options\nOr you can simply go casual by grabbing food up on deck. There are healthy wraps and fruit. Also, indulge with complementary soft serve ice cream, soda and coffee. And, yes, there\u2019s pizza, chicken and burgers. But also more exotic items like Shawarma \u2013 complete with grilled meats and lots of toppings.\n\nCabanas buffet\nWe\u2019re going to let you in on the best kept Disney Cruise dining secret. Imagine you\u2019ve spent an action-packed day exploring Rome, snorkeling in the Caribbean, or simply wore yourself out riding the Aquaduck water coaster, and you\u2019re looking for a laid back, full service dining experience. Then why not skip the dining room and instead opt for dinner under the stars up on deck? Cabanas offers a free-flowing buffet experience by day, but come nighttime it features signature dishes from the main dining restaurants in a subdued, and sublime, setting.\n\n24-hour room service\nNot even feeling up to leaving your room to dine at all? No worries, 24-hour in-room dining onboard is also complimentary, meaning that you don\u2019t even need to put on pants to enjoy fresh salmon, salads, paninis, soup and more. It\u2019s the perfect option for late-night snacking, a casual dinner to enjoy with Disney movies in your room, or a daytime meal to savor with breathtaking verandah views.\n\nWhether savoring upscale dining, snacking on classic American fare or indulging in treats, your tastebuds are sure to cry out for more. While on your way to your next Disney Cruise dining adventure, work up an appetite by taking the stairs!\n\nWant to learn more about Disney Cruise Line?

                "description": "Sailing on a Disney Cruise is an unforgettable experience. From pool parties to fine dining to Disney-style broadway shows, there\u2019s never a dull moment on board. But with so many activities to choose from, how do you know where to start? Here are our tips for the first things you should do onboard a Disney Cruise. Plan your Disney cruise: http://bit.ly/1T5ovZ5\n\nStep 1: B-line to lunch\nYour stateroom won\u2019t be ready until the early afternoon, so grab some lunch instead. Be sure to come hungry, because this is one of many bountiful meals included in your cruise price. \n\nStep 2: Download the Disney Cruise Line Navigator app\nThis app will help you keep your daily cruise plans on track. It includes information about the ship, daily activities and other helpful info. Search for \u2018Disney Cruise Line\u2019 in your app store and it will be downloaded in a flash!\n\nStep 3: Take a quick tour of the ship\nGet the lay of the land by taking a walk around the ship. You can reference the maps on the walls to get a good sense of where you are. This is the perfect opportunity to scope out all of the things you want to do during your cruise.  \n\nStep 4: Make reservations for specialty dining and the spa\nEvery ship has fine dining restaurants and a luxurious spa. Although they are an extra cost, they are completely worth it! Spots fill up quickly and you won\u2019t want to miss out.\n\nStep 5: Sign the kids up for their clubs\nToddlers, kids, tweens and teens each have their own place to hang out. Get your kiddos signed up for the club in their age range. You\u2019ll have a hard time peeling them away from all the fun.\n\nStep 6: Ride the AquaDuck\nBe one of the first people to experience this awesome water coaster. It zips you around the perimeter of the ship and gives you unobstructed views of the ocean. It\u2019s a popular attraction, so check it off your list early!\n\nStep 7: Kick back with a cocktail\nThere are plenty of places on deck to grab a cold drink. Stop by one of the bars and order your favorite concoction. You\u2019ll be relaxing in no time!\n\nStep 8: Sail away\nAfter the muster drill, it\u2019s time to sail away. Don\u2019t miss the party on the pool deck! You can dance the afternoon away with all your Disney pals. It\u2019s the perfect way to bid farewell to dry land. \n\nStep 9: Head back to your state room\nYour luggage will be waiting for you in front of your stateroom. Open your room for the first time and sink in to your new home away from home. \n\nStep 10: Finish the evening with nighttime entertainment\nEach night there is a new broadway-style show as well as plenty of activities. You can choose from dance clubs, trivia nights, movie screenings, wine tastings and so much more. \n\nWant to learn more about Disney Cruise Line?

Click play to check out the top sights. \n\nWhen ready, browse vacation packages to Edinburgh: https://www.expedia.com/Edinburgh.d6069845.Destination-Travel-Guides\n\nA #vacation to #Edinburgh lets you rub shoulders with history. Its Old Town and Royal Mile are filled with the ghosts of medieval merchants and poets, while its New Town shines with the glories of the Scottish Enlightenment.  \n\nTo see Edinburgh in all her glory, climb to Arthur\u2019s Seat, the highest of the city\u2019s seven peaks. #Visit Edinburgh Castle, the symbol of Scotland. Over the last eleven centuries, this castle has been laid siege to 26 times but still it stands, a testimony to the indomitable spirit of the Scots.\n \nExplore centuries of innovation at the Scottish Museum, or head to South Queensferry to see the Forth Bridge, an engineering marvel when it opened in 1890. The Royal Botanic Gardens is one of the world\u2019s oldest and most important centers of botanical science, yet it\u2019s still a place which invites one to slow down.\n \nFor now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. \n\nMore travel information around Edinburgh: https://www.expedia.com/Edinburgh.dx6069845\n\nSubscribe to Expedia\u2019s YouTube Channel for great travel videos and join the conversation on the best vacation ideas. \n \n---------\n\nFollow us on social media: \nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Expedia\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/expedia\n\n---------\n\n0:00 - Edinburgh\n0:44 - Royal Mile\n0:53 - New Town\n1:17 - Arthur\u2019s Seat\n1:47 - Edinburgh Castle\n2:20 - Royal Yacht Britannia\n2:50 - Thistle Chapel\n3:17 - Princess Street Gardens\n3:43 - The Writers Museum\n3:56 - The Elephant House Cafe\n4:11 - The University of Edinburgh\n4:37 - Forth Bridge\n4:56 - Royal Botanic Gardens",

Click play to check out the top sights. \n\nWhen ready, browse vacation packages to Edinburgh: https://www.expedia.com/Edinburgh.d6069845.Destination-Travel-Guides\n\nA #vacation to #Edinburgh lets you rub shoulders with history. Its Old Town and Royal Mile are filled with the ghosts of medieval merchants and poets, while its New Town shines with the glories of the Scottish Enlightenment.  \n\nTo see Edinburgh in all her glory, climb to Arthur\u2019s Seat, the highest of the city\u2019s seven peaks. #Visit Edinburgh Castle, the symbol of Scotland. Over the last eleven centuries, this castle has been laid siege to 26 times but still it stands, a testimony to the indomitable spirit of the Scots.\n \nExplore centuries of innovation at the Scottish Museum, or head to South Queensferry to see the Forth Bridge, an engineering marvel when it opened in 1890. The Royal Botanic Gardens is one of the world\u2019s oldest and most important centers of botanical science, yet it\u2019s still a place which invites one to slow down.\n \nFor now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. \n\nMore travel information around Edinburgh: https://www.expedia.com/Edinburgh.dx6069845\n\nSubscribe to Expedia\u2019s YouTube Channel for great travel videos and join the conversation on the best vacation ideas. \n \n---------\n\nFollow us on social media: \nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Expedia\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/expedia\n\n---------\n\n0:00 - Edinburgh\n0:44 - Royal Mile\n0:53 - New Town\n1:17 - Arthur\u2019s Seat\n1:47 - Edinburgh Castle\n2:20 - Royal Yacht Britannia\n2:50 - Thistle Chapel\n3:17 - Princess Street Gardens\n3:43 - The Writers Museum\n3:56 - The Elephant House Cafe\n4:11 - The University of Edinburgh\n4:37 - Forth Bridge\n4:56 - Royal Botanic Gardens"

Some 2,000 years ago, the Moche people and later the Chim\u00fa, managed to cultivate the arid Moche Valley and build thriving cities such as Chan Chan, made entirely from adobe bricks. \n\nThese pre-Columbian civilizations also created the mighty Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Moon, wove reed fishing boats and dug canals for irrigation. \nThe museum in the coastal site of El Brujo contains a tattooed mummy of a warrior leader or priestess, who was dubbed the Lady of Cao. Find out more about these ancient cultures in Trujillo\u2019s Archaeological Museum. Then, admire the region\u2019s pure-bred Paso Horses during a Marinera show with costumed dancers.

Some 2,000 years ago, the Moche people and later the Chim\u00fa, managed to cultivate the arid Moche Valley and build thriving cities such as Chan Chan, made entirely from adobe bricks. \n\nThese pre-Columbian civilizations also created the mighty Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Moon, wove reed fishing boats and dug canals for irrigation. \nThe museum in the coastal site of El Brujo contains a tattooed mummy of a warrior leader or priestess, who was dubbed the Lady of Cao. Find out more about these ancient cultures in Trujillo\u2019s Archaeological Museum. Then, admire the region\u2019s pure-bred Paso Horses during a Marinera show with costumed dancers. End your stay with a visit to the Cathedral and Freedom Monument on Plaza de Armas in the city\u2019s picturesque Historic Centre.\n\nFor now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. \n\nMore travel information around Trujillo: https://www.expedia.com/Trujillo.dx3537\u00a0\n\n---------\n\nFollow us on social media: \nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Expedia\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/expedia\n\n---------\n\n0:00 - Trujillo \n1:36 - Trujillo Cathedral Basilica\n1:58 - Archeological Museum of Trujillo\n2:19 - Temple of the Sun and the Moon\n3:01 - El Brujo \n3:44 - Chan Chan \n5:06 - Plaza de Armas\n5:21 - Casa Urquiaga"

After all, there\u2019s no need to waste the day in the airport terminal when you could be venturing around the nation\u2019s capital. The clock is ticking until your next flight, but there\u2019s lots you can do in just 24 hours in Budapest. \n\nWhen you\u2019re looking to experience Budapest in a day, start your adventures at the Royal Palace on Castle Hill. The compound was built in the 13th century, and it includes popular attractions such as the Hungarian National Gallery and the Budapest History Museum. Next, check out the massive Hungarian Parliament Building and gaze at the Holy Crown of Hungary, located in the central hall. If you still have time to spare during your layover, take a dip in the steamy water at the Szechenyi Medicinal Bath, stroll around the Liberty Statue on Gellert Hill, and make a stop at world-famous St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica. \n\nEven if you\u2019re limited to one day in Budapest, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to see some of the city\u2019s most valued sites. Whether you venture to the historic spots or simply mosey across the Chain Bridge, you just may find yourself hoping for a flight cancellation.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\nFollow us on social media:\nTWITTER: twitter.com/expedia\nFACEBOOK: facebook.com/expedia\nINSTAGRAM: instagram.com/expedia\nGOOGLE+: plus.google.com/+expedia\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder:\nViewfinder.expedia.com",

After all, there\u2019s no need to waste the day in the airport terminal when you could be venturing around the nation\u2019s capital. The clock is ticking until your next flight, but there\u2019s lots you can do in just 24 hours in Budapest. \n\nWhen you\u2019re looking to experience Budapest in a day, start your adventures at the Royal Palace on Castle Hill. The compound was built in the 13th century, and it includes popular attractions such as the Hungarian National Gallery and the Budapest History Museum. Next, check out the massive Hungarian Parliament Building and gaze at the Holy Crown of Hungary, located in the central hall. If you still have time to spare during your layover, take a dip in the steamy water at the Szechenyi Medicinal Bath, stroll around the Liberty Statue on Gellert Hill, and make a stop at world-famous St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica. \n\nEven if you\u2019re limited to one day in Budapest, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to see some of the city\u2019s most valued sites. Whether you venture to the historic spots or simply mosey across the Chain Bridge, you just may find yourself hoping for a flight cancellation.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\nFollow us on social media:\nTWITTER: twitter.com/expedia\nFACEBOOK: facebook.com/expedia\nINSTAGRAM: instagram.com/expedia\nGOOGLE+: plus.google.com/+expedia\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder:\nViewfinder.expedia.com"

Several hours is more than enough time to get a sense of the city, so instead of longingly looking out the airport windows, hail a cab and experience one day in Kuala Lumpur before your next flight.\n\nThe capital city is home to various things to do, from sightseeing to shopping.

Ready to ditch the airport terminal and paint the town red before your next flight? Delve into the culture, visit the hottest attractions, and nosh on some local grub to get a taste of the Pearl of the Orient.\n\nWhen you only have one day in Hong Kong, make Victoria Peak the first stop on your itinerary. As you venture to the top of the highest mountain on Hong Kong Island, you\u2019re in for a real treat\u2014the sweeping city views. At its peak, you\u2019ll find a viewing deck, restaurants, and even shopping centers. For your next stop, make a beeline to the Tian Tan Buddha, located on Lantau Island. Standing 112 feet tall, the gigantic bronze statue sits on a lotus, surrounded by The Offering of the Six Devas statues. While you\u2019re in town, hitch a ride on the Ngong Ping 360 cable car over the Tung Chung Bay, search for the Bruce Lee statue along the Avenue of Stars, and try some authentic dim sum. If you still have time to spare, climb aboard a junk and cruise around the archipelago of 260 islands.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate 24 hours in Hong Kong. Take advantage of your layover and soak up the culture outside of the airport.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTWITTER: twitter.com/expedia\nFACEBOOK: facebook.com/expedia\nINSTAGRAM: instagram.com/expedia\nGOOGLE+: plus.google.com/+expedia\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder:\nViewfinder.expedia.com",

Ready to ditch the airport terminal and paint the town red before your next flight? Delve into the culture, visit the hottest attractions, and nosh on some local grub to get a taste of the Pearl of the Orient.\n\nWhen you only have one day in Hong Kong, make Victoria Peak the first stop on your itinerary. As you venture to the top of the highest mountain on Hong Kong Island, you\u2019re in for a real treat\u2014the sweeping city views. At its peak, you\u2019ll find a viewing deck, restaurants, and even shopping centers. For your next stop, make a beeline to the Tian Tan Buddha, located on Lantau Island. Standing 112 feet tall, the gigantic bronze statue sits on a lotus, surrounded by The Offering of the Six Devas statues. While you\u2019re in town, hitch a ride on the Ngong Ping 360 cable car over the Tung Chung Bay, search for the Bruce Lee statue along the Avenue of Stars, and try some authentic dim sum. If you still have time to spare, climb aboard a junk and cruise around the archipelago of 260 islands.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate 24 hours in Hong Kong. Take advantage of your layover and soak up the culture outside of the airport.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTWITTER: twitter.com/expedia\nFACEBOOK: facebook.com/expedia\nINSTAGRAM: instagram.com/expedia\nGOOGLE+: plus.google.com/+expedia\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder:\nViewfinder.expedia.com"

Instead of staying in the airport, gazing out the window at palm trees, hop in a cab and take on the coastal oasis. We just hope you packed your swimsuit!\n\nTrying to decide where to go in Cancun when you have limited time to explore? You can\u2019t go wrong with the sand and sea. Playa Caracol is a hot spot for parasailers, while Playa Delfines is the place to marvel at dolphins frolicking off the coast. Jump off the dock into the turquoise waters at Playa Langosta, or snorkel around Playa Tortugas. For more outdoor adventures, make the trek over to Chichen Itza and check out the ancient Mayan ruins, or cruise off the coast for a different view of the peninsula. Meanwhile, if you\u2019re in town later in the evening, Cancun\u2019s Hotel Zone boasts a popping nightlife scene with live music, DJs, and endless dancing. \n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what to see in Cancun, we have all the answers. This seaside city is overflowing with tropical landscapes, history lessons, watersports, and more. From beach volleyball to nightclubs, you\u2019ll find plenty do during just one day in Cancun. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTWITTER: twitter.com/expedia\nFACEBOOK: facebook.com/expedia\nINSTAGRAM: instagram.com/expedia\nGOOGLE+: plus.google.com/+expedia\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder:\nViewfinder.expedia.com",

With nearby beaches, shops, and museums, what better way to spend 24 hours in Los Angeles than by hitting the streets and shores? \n\nLos Angeles sits on the coast of Southern California. Because of the seemingly perpetual warm weather and sunshine, it\u2019s always a good day to soak up the SoCal sunshine. Quirky Venice Beach with its eclectic boardwalk scene is just 6 miles north of Los Angeles International, while the nearby Santa Monica Pier dazzles with its theme park rides. Meanwhile, the ritzy shops along Rodeo Drive and the Melrose Avenue boutiques are prime retail therapy spots. To top off your one day in LA, check out the exhibits at the Museum of Contemporary Art or gaze at the stars from the Griffith Observatory. \n\nDon\u2019t let a time crunch prevent you from getting a sneak peek of the city. With hours to spare before your next flight, venture out in the wonderful world of La La Land. Even if you just dip your toes in the Pacific Ocean or catch a glimpse of the Hollywood sign, the City of Angels won\u2019t disappoint. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTWITTER: twitter.com/expedia\nFACEBOOK: facebook.com/expedia\nINSTAGRAM: instagram.com/expedia\nGOOGLE+: plus.google.com/+expedia\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder:\nViewfinder.expedia.com",

                    "description": "When you\u2019re stuck with an extended layover in Los Angeles, consider it the perfect excuse to get out and explore the city. With nearby beaches, shops, and museums, what better way to spend 24 hours in Los Angeles than by hitting the streets and shores? \n\nLos Angeles sits on the coast of Southern California. Because of the seemingly perpetual warm weather and sunshine, it\u2019s always a good day to soak up the SoCal sunshine. Quirky Venice Beach with its eclectic boardwalk scene is just 6 miles north of Los Angeles International, while the nearby Santa Monica Pier dazzles with its theme park rides. Meanwhile, the ritzy shops along Rodeo Drive and the Melrose Avenue boutiques are prime retail therapy spots. To top off your one day in LA, check out the exhibits at the Museum of Contemporary Art or gaze at the stars from the Griffith Observatory. \n\nDon\u2019t let a time crunch prevent you from getting a sneak peek of the city. With hours to spare before your next flight, venture out in the wonderful world of La La Land. Even if you just dip your toes in the Pacific Ocean or catch a glimpse of the Hollywood sign, the City of Angels won\u2019t disappoint. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTWITTER: twitter.com/expedia\nFACEBOOK: facebook.com/expedia\nINSTAGRAM: instagram.com/expedia\nGOOGLE+: plus.google.com/+expedia\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder:\nViewfinder.expedia.com"

Head over to the cocktail bars, the nightclubs, and the lounges to enjoy good food, good company, and great fun as you dance or chat the night away. \n\nWhat will you do during your Fira sightseeing?\n\nVisit our Fira travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

While a beautiful location for hiking and relaxation during the summer, this 2,500 square mile alpine mountain sanctuary comes alive during the winter.\n\nSnowy forests, glacier-carved lakes, and icefields set the scene in this, Canada\u2019s first national park. Your Banff National Park tour begins in Banff itself, a resort town with a casual atmosphere, loaded with bars and restaurants, and continues into the park\u2019s vast outdoor space, which is often utilized for winter activities. Whether you\u2019re an experienced skier or are new to the sport, you\u2019ll find thousands of acres of slopes to carve up. Take lessons in town or at one of the resorts dotting the mountains, or, if you\u2019re not sure about skiing, try snowshoeing and hiking through the pristine wilderness. Embark on the Johnston Canyon Ice Walk for one of the most astonishing views of nature you\u2019ll ever see\u2026or book a sleigh ride or dog sledding ride for an adventure straight out of a storybook.\n\nReady to really appreciate some natural beauty? Your Banff National Park sightseeing will lead you to the Banff Gondola and let it take you to the summit for a view of Bow Valley and the surrounding Rocky Mountains. We promise you\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \n\nWhat will you do at Banff National Park?\n\nVisit our Banff National Park travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

While a beautiful location for hiking and relaxation during the summer, this 2,500 square mile alpine mountain sanctuary comes alive during the winter.\n\nSnowy forests, glacier-carved lakes, and icefields set the scene in this, Canada\u2019s first national park. Your Banff National Park tour begins in Banff itself, a resort town with a casual atmosphere, loaded with bars and restaurants, and continues into the park\u2019s vast outdoor space, which is often utilized for winter activities. Whether you\u2019re an experienced skier or are new to the sport, you\u2019ll find thousands of acres of slopes to carve up. Take lessons in town or at one of the resorts dotting the mountains, or, if you\u2019re not sure about skiing, try snowshoeing and hiking through the pristine wilderness. Embark on the Johnston Canyon Ice Walk for one of the most astonishing views of nature you\u2019ll ever see\u2026or book a sleigh ride or dog sledding ride for an adventure straight out of a storybook.\n\nReady to really appreciate some natural beauty? Your Banff National Park sightseeing will lead you to the Banff Gondola and let it take you to the summit for a view of Bow Valley and the surrounding Rocky Mountains. We promise you\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \n\nWhat will you do at Banff National Park?\n\nVisit our Banff National Park travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

A tour of this beautiful part of Alberta is well worth your time if you love the outdoors.\n\nSightseeing in Johnston Canyon begins with winding down Bow Valley Parkway. Once you arrive in the canyon itself, you\u2019re in for a treat. During the summer, Johnston Canyon is a green, forested place full of wildlife, but winter is when it truly shines. When there\u2019s a chill in the air and ice clings to pine needles, Johnston Canyon transforms into a snow-blanketed wonderland. The towering walls of the canyon lend a quiet, stoic sort of tranquility to the trails and pathways within, creating a world of remarkable stillness. \n\nOnce you arrive, embark on the Johnston Canyon Ice Walk, which carries you past streams and striking frozen waterfalls. Snow and ice cling to spruce and aspen trees, glittering in the sunlight. If you\u2019re lucky, you might spot elk, moose, and even wolves.\n\nJohnston Canyon tourism is appropriate for visitors of all ages and walks of life. You can follow an easy, paved path to the Lower Falls, or set out on a longer hike to visit the Upper Falls. Experienced hikers can take in the quiet beauty of the inkpots, a set of six small, spring-fed pools. Be warned\u2014you may wish to bring snowshoes and cleats, as the pathway can get slippery.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite part of Johnston Canyon?\n\nVisit our Johnston Canyon travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

In summer, these mountains are exquisite alpine peaks, capped in green trees and towering over lush valleys. In winter, these mountains are arguably even more beautiful\u2014snow-capped precipices that stretch on as far as the eye can see. \n\nYou can get an up-close look at this beauty when sightseeing on the Banff Gondola. From the town of Banff, you\u2019ll head to Sulphur Mountain, located just a few miles away. Climb into the glass-enclosed gondola with a handful of other passengers. When the Banff Gondola tour begins, your gondola will ascend the mountain range at a measured pace, giving you plenty of time to see Banff itself, the Bow Valley, and the mountain ranges that comprise the Canadian Rockies. \n\nThe Banff Gondola stops at a staggering height of 7,500 feet, allowing you an astonishing view of the world below.

In summer, these mountains are exquisite alpine peaks, capped in green trees and towering over lush valleys. In winter, these mountains are arguably even more beautiful\u2014snow-capped precipices that stretch on as far as the eye can see. \n\nYou can get an up-close look at this beauty when sightseeing on the Banff Gondola. From the town of Banff, you\u2019ll head to Sulphur Mountain, located just a few miles away. Climb into the glass-enclosed gondola with a handful of other passengers. When the Banff Gondola tour begins, your gondola will ascend the mountain range at a measured pace, giving you plenty of time to see Banff itself, the Bow Valley, and the mountain ranges that comprise the Canadian Rockies. \n\nThe Banff Gondola stops at a staggering height of 7,500 feet, allowing you an astonishing view of the world below. Bring your camera to snap some pictures, because you\u2019ll never want to forget the stunning vistas that you see. If you elect to stay on top of the mountain for a bit, you can learn about the history of the region on a one-mile interpretive walk.

During your Banff sightseeing, you\u2019ll learn that the town\u2019s residents and visitors are a lively bunch, and you\u2019ll find the local businesses are perfect for this festive crowd.

                "description": "https://www.expedia.com/Cork.d603083.Destination-Travel-Guides\n\n\nCome travel with us in Cork City! For the inside scoop on this charming destination, watch our Ireland travel guide video.\n\nCork City is unique in that it\u2019s a city on an island, surrounded by the River Lee\u2019s two channels. In fact, many of the city\u2019s streets are built over waterways, so expect to cross countless bridges during your stay. The quaint town center is also located upstream from Cork City Harbour, the world\u2019s second-largest natural harbor. \n\nTake a city tour and revel in the architectural splendor of this historical town. You can\u2019t miss Saint Fin Barre\u2019s Cathedral, which looks like a castle with its three spires and gothic designs. Dating back to 1870, this gargoyle-adorned cathedral is made from limestone, bath stone, and marble. Check out the magnificent stained glass and the intricate carvings scattered throughout the complex. \n\nFor another look at the town\u2019s past, make your way over to the Cork City Gaol. The prison originally opened in 1824, holding both men and women, but in 1878, it became the Women\u2019s Gaol. During British control and the Irish War of Independence, many Republican women were imprisoned here.

During your visit, take a guided tour of the prison grounds and learn fascinating stories of the past. \n\nLooking for more exciting things to do in Cork City? Shop around the English Market. With roots dating back to 1788, this market is considered one of the oldest of its kind. Saunter around the countless vendors selling fresh poultry, meat, cheese, cakes, and more. A feast for your eyes\u2014and stomach\u2014you\u2019ll find local treats, crafts, and even souvenirs at this eclectic bazaar. \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind cruising roughly 6 miles northwest of the city, head to the famous Blarney Castle. You\u2019ve probably heard of the legend, which says that if you kiss the Blarney Stone you\u2019ll receive the gift of eloquence, so why not give it a shot? Besides puckering up, you\u2019ll come across other seemingly magical spots, such as the Witch\u2019s Stone and Wishing Steps. Explore the surrounding meadows, view the ruins of the Court, and venture into the dungeon.   \n\nDublin often gets all the attention, but many Corkonians like to consider Cork City the \u201creal capital\u201d of Ireland. Visit this harbor city and decide for yourself if it deserves the capital title. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

For the inside scoop on this charming destination, watch our Ireland travel guide video.\n\nCork City is unique in that it\u2019s a city on an island, surrounded by the River Lee\u2019s two channels. In fact, many of the city\u2019s streets are built over waterways, so expect to cross countless bridges during your stay. The quaint town center is also located upstream from Cork City Harbour, the world\u2019s second-largest natural harbor. \n\nTake a city tour and revel in the architectural splendor of this historical town. You can\u2019t miss Saint Fin Barre\u2019s Cathedral, which looks like a castle with its three spires and gothic designs. Dating back to 1870, this gargoyle-adorned cathedral is made from limestone, bath stone, and marble. Check out the magnificent stained glass and the intricate carvings scattered throughout the complex. \n\nFor another look at the town\u2019s past, make your way over to the Cork City Gaol.

Bushmills Distillery sightseeing includes a visit to the Mixing Room, where ingredients begin their journey toward whiskey.

These items combined give Bushmills its unique taste, and are featured prominently on the brand\u2019s label. You can also check out the Cask Room and Bottling Room, among others.

This extraordinary estate is closed during the winter, so if you\u2019re planning to visit, make sure you plan your trip for the spring or summer. \n\nBantry House perches over Bantry Bay in County Cork, Ireland. This onetime small home grew exponentially after Richard White purchased the land in 1765; through his careful expansion, the estate eventually surpassed 80,000 acres. It remained in the White family throughout its colorful history, including a five-year stint as a hospital during the Irish Civil War, and today it has been converted into a charming bed and breakfast and tea room. \n\nBantry House sightseeing includes a trip through some of the estate\u2019s gardens. Explore terraces, rows of shrubs, and hedges, many of which overlook Bantry Bay. A tour of Bantry House\u2019s interior is much like wandering into a museum, as the house is loaded with artwork, antiques, and other decorations. Many of these items date back to Viscount Berehaven, who traveled extensively through Europe with his wife during the 1820s and 1830s. Bantry House isn\u2019t all antiques and art, though; on Fridays, you can peruse local produce and potential souvenirs at the Bantry Market.\n\nWhat was your favorite part of Bantry House?\n\nVisit our Bantry House travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

Located in the center of Dublin, Ireland, Trinity College alumni include Bram Stoker and Oscar Wilde. The campus sits across from the former Irish Houses of Parliament, and these buildings, among several others, have given the school its distinguished, instantly recognizable appearance.\n\nA tour of Trinity College will reveal a number of classically styled buildings and vast amounts of green space. You\u2019ll no doubt stop at the Campanile, a bell tower and one of the standout points of the campus. We don\u2019t recommend passing through the Campanile when the bell tolls; superstitious students believe they will fail their exams if it goes off while they\u2019re beneath it. If you\u2019re not a student here, or simply do not fear bad luck, feel free to laugh in the face of danger and walk beneath it while it rings.\n\nOutside of Trinity College, you\u2019ll find a wealth of things to do. The campus is right near Grafton Street, famed for its many shopping and eating opportunities. In addition, you should pay a visit to the National Wax Museum, or step aboard the sailing ship Jeanie Johnston, a replica of the vessels that carried hundreds of thousands of immigrants to the New World in the 1800s.   \n\nWill you walk through the Campanile?\n\nVisit our Trinity College travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

The campus sits across from the former Irish Houses of Parliament, and these buildings, among several others, have given the school its distinguished, instantly recognizable appearance.\n\nA tour of Trinity College will reveal a number of classically styled buildings and vast amounts of green space. You\u2019ll no doubt stop at the Campanile, a bell tower and one of the standout points of the campus. We don\u2019t recommend passing through the Campanile when the bell tolls; superstitious students believe they will fail their exams if it goes off while they\u2019re beneath it. If you\u2019re not a student here, or simply do not fear bad luck, feel free to laugh in the face of danger and walk beneath it while it rings.\n\nOutside of Trinity College, you\u2019ll find a wealth of things to do. The campus is right near Grafton Street, famed for its many shopping and eating opportunities. In addition, you should pay a visit to the National Wax Museum, or step aboard the sailing ship Jeanie Johnston, a replica of the vessels that carried hundreds of thousands of immigrants to the New World in the 1800s.   \n\nWill you walk through the Campanile?\n\nVisit our Trinity College travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

It was walled off in 1664 and had several houses built around it as a sort of central square. This continued for nearly a century, effectively turning St. Stephen\u2019s Green into a park for an early planned community. At this point, since only the very wealthy could afford to live in the houses around the green, to tour St. Stephen\u2019s Green became the privilege of the upper classes. \n\nAn act of Parliament opened the park to the public in the late 1800s, and it\u2019s been a popular downtown destination ever since. Since it is adjacent to Grafton Street\u2014one of Dublin\u2019s biggest shopping areas\u2014St. Stephen\u2019s Green is a popular place among locals who stop by to relax after a long day of wandering in and out of shops. You can also do a little sightseeing in St. Stephen\u2019s Green itself. The park is full of sculptures and memorials, and you can easily spend several hours wandering its trails, listening to the chirps of birds and the wind rustling through the green leaves above. St. Stephen\u2019s Green is also home to a lake, an artificial waterfall, and countless types of flora and fauna.  \n\nHow will you unwind in St. Stephen\u2019s Green?\n\nVisit our St. Stephen\u2019s Green travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

After its abandonment in 1924, it sat for many years before refurbishment and conversion to a museum in the 1980s. While it showcases a rather dark portion of Irish history, it\u2019s nonetheless a major draw for those curious about the nation\u2019s past, and Kilmainham Gaol sightseeing is always fascinating. \n\nThe gaol\u2019s cells were not segregated; up to five men, women, and even children as young as seven could be held together in each small chamber. Wander through dim, narrow corridors lit only by a handful of lamps and try to imagine scores of other inhabitants moving beside you. The center atrium looks pristine now, but during the prison\u2019s heyday, it would have been choked with prisoners being shuffled to their cells or off to the colonies. Each cell had one candle to provide illumination and warmth, and each candle had to last for two weeks\u2014needless to say, much of the time these cells were cold, miserable places. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to explore the rest of Dublin once you finish up at Kilmainham Gaol. Directly across the street from the prison is the Irish Museum of Modern Art and its Garden of Galleries; this is a good spot to cleanse your eyes before checking out the rest of the city.\n\nWhat area of Kilmainham Gaol moved you the most?\n \nVisit our Kilmainham Gaol travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

After its abandonment in 1924, it sat for many years before refurbishment and conversion to a museum in the 1980s. While it showcases a rather dark portion of Irish history, it\u2019s nonetheless a major draw for those curious about the nation\u2019s past, and Kilmainham Gaol sightseeing is always fascinating. \n\nThe gaol\u2019s cells were not segregated; up to five men, women, and even children as young as seven could be held together in each small chamber. Wander through dim, narrow corridors lit only by a handful of lamps and try to imagine scores of other inhabitants moving beside you. The center atrium looks pristine now, but during the prison\u2019s heyday, it would have been choked with prisoners being shuffled to their cells or off to the colonies. Each cell had one candle to provide illumination and warmth, and each candle had to last for two weeks\u2014needless to say, much of the time these cells were cold, miserable places. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to explore the rest of Dublin once you finish up at Kilmainham Gaol. Directly across the street from the prison is the Irish Museum of Modern Art and its Garden of Galleries; this is a good spot to cleanse your eyes before checking out the rest of the city.\n\nWhat area of Kilmainham Gaol moved you the most?\n \nVisit our Kilmainham Gaol travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

Below are some links to those recent videos. Feel free to compare with this clip and comment below to let us know which ones you prefer, and what else you\u2019d love to see from Expedia on YouTube!\n\nSt. Petersburg \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3ISUUO0CSo\n\nKyoto:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd1wzlwtKJ0\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe small town of Killarney is tucked at the base of MacGillycuddy\u2019s Reeks, Ireland\u2019s largest mountain range. This charming community has been a popular spot for European visitors since the 1800s, thanks in part to its striking surrounding woodland and temperate climate. Killarney\u2019s tourism has been a major boost for its economy; aside from Dublin, there are more hotel beds in Killarney than in any other Irish community. \n\nStart your Killarney tour with a walk down High Street or College Street, where you can try out some authentic Irish fare. Grab a drink in one of the town\u2019s many pubs, or stop in at a caf\u00e9 if you want to forgo the alcohol. The town continues to hum along even after the sun goes down; if you\u2019re a night owl, you\u2019ll love spending the later hours checking out eateries, cafes, and nightclubs. \n\nAny Killarney sightseeing should include Killarney National Park, which is located just two miles from the town. This gorgeous landscape is home to wildlife and a number of Killarney\u2019s famed tourist attractions. Wander through some 24,000 acres of lakes and mountains, which are home to red deer, ospreys, and even Arctic char. \n\nReady to be impressed? Killarney National Park also houses Ross Castle, a genuine medieval tower perched on the shores of Lough Leane. Looking for something a little less medieval? Tour Muckross House, a 65-room mansion that once hosted Queen Victoria. Before you head back to town, grab a picture on the Old Weir Bridge. How old is it? No one is entirely sure, but historians think it may have been constructed in the 1500s. Like Killarney itself, the bridge remains an endearing place to visit.\n\nWhat will you do in Killarney?\n\nVisit our Killarney travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

In between, you\u2019ll see freshwater swamps and groups of mangroves, along with villages full of river dwellers and traders who have made the Kinabatangan their livelihood for centuries.\n\nYour Kinabatangan sightseeing will no doubt include the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, which sits in the lowlands near the coast. Climb into a small boat and motor down the river, taking in all the astonishing flora and fauna. Orangutans, crocodiles, and hundreds of species of birds, among other animals, make this place their home.\n\nWhat was your favorite part of the Kinabatangan River?\n\nVisit our Kinabatangan travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/\n"

                "description": "Krabi, located off the coast of southern Thailand, is widely considered one of the most beautiful parts of the continent. Whether you\u2019re traveling to this popular province to relax and forget your cares, or you want a little excitement set in the tropics, Krabi has something for you.  \n\nThe first step in your Krabi tour is probably beachcombing on its pristine shores. The famed Railay Beach is beloved by tourists and locals alike; when you walk along its white sands and stick your toes in the warm Andaman Sea, you\u2019ll love it as well. Make sure you arrive at the waterfront early if it is peace and quiet you\u2019re after, as competition gets stiff for a patch of sand.\n\nLike rock climbing? You\u2019re in luck. Krabi\u2019s limestone cliffs attract climbers from around the world, and you can join their ranks in scaling these heights. For a quieter adventure set amidst pure, undisturbed natural beauty, head to Phi Phi Island, one of many islands surrounding Krabi. This is the place for exploring the wild jungles and waterfalls that dot the unspoiled wilderness.\n\nThe can\u2019t-miss stops during your Krabi sightseeing include the enchanting night markets. These are the places to go for local-made clothing, crafts, and other souvenirs, and everywhere you turn, you\u2019ll be entertained by street performers.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite part of Krabi?\n\nVisit our Krabi travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

                    "description": "Krabi, located off the coast of southern Thailand, is widely considered one of the most beautiful parts of the continent. Whether you\u2019re traveling to this popular province to relax and forget your cares, or you want a little excitement set in the tropics, Krabi has something for you.  \n\nThe first step in your Krabi tour is probably beachcombing on its pristine shores. The famed Railay Beach is beloved by tourists and locals alike; when you walk along its white sands and stick your toes in the warm Andaman Sea, you\u2019ll love it as well. Make sure you arrive at the waterfront early if it is peace and quiet you\u2019re after, as competition gets stiff for a patch of sand.\n\nLike rock climbing? You\u2019re in luck. Krabi\u2019s limestone cliffs attract climbers from around the world, and you can join their ranks in scaling these heights. For a quieter adventure set amidst pure, undisturbed natural beauty, head to Phi Phi Island, one of many islands surrounding Krabi. This is the place for exploring the wild jungles and waterfalls that dot the unspoiled wilderness.\n\nThe can\u2019t-miss stops during your Krabi sightseeing include the enchanting night markets. These are the places to go for local-made clothing, crafts, and other souvenirs, and everywhere you turn, you\u2019ll be entertained by street performers.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite part of Krabi?\n\nVisit our Krabi travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

Dive into the crystal clear waters of Palau Payar Marine Park, where you can snorkel or scuba dive through the colorful masses of tropical fish that inhabit the reefs there. If you prefer dry land, tour Langkawi\u2019s lush green jungles, which adorn the peak of Gunung Mat Chinchang. You can take a guided tour, or ride the Langkawi Cable Car up to the top of this peak to take in the stunning natural beauty of the island. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten your fill of the outdoors, head to Kuah, the largest town on Pulau Langkawi. This is the home of duty-free shopping, so stock up on exotic local goods. Once you\u2019ve decked yourself out in your new purchases, head to one of the many nightclubs dotting the downtown area, where you can dance with fellow partygoers.\n\nWhat will you do in Langkawi?\n\nVisit our Langkawi travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

Thanks to its position near a stunning reef, Mabul Island tours almost always highlight the local sea life, and this gem is the gateway to some of the finest snorkeling and scuba diving in the world. Because of this, Mabul Island sightseeing will, of course, involve a lot of time spent surrounded by water. Whether you just want to float above the reef to study the teeming world below, or you want to get up close and personal with cuttlefish and gobis while submerged in the ocean, the warm sea is the primary draw for tourism.\n\nIn addition, Mabul Island is located very close to Sapidan Island, which boasts one of the most extraordinary marine ecosystems in the world. Because Sipidan is so small, though, many visitors prefer to stay on Mabul Island and take a boat out to Sapidan when they\u2019re ready to dive. \n\nWhile spending time on dry land, relax in one of Mabul Island\u2019s many resorts\u2014or enjoy the novelty of staying on a converted drilling platform just offshore. You can also go mountain biking, play beach volleyball, or just relax amidst the fragrant tropical plants that adorn the island.\n\nWhat did you see when you last went diving at Mabul Island?\n\nVisit our Mabul Island travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

Whether you wish to embrace a vacation of ultimate solitude or desire to be waited on hand and foot, Pangkor Laut will make it happen. \n\nWhat part of Pangkor Laut did you enjoy most?\n\n Visit our Pangkor Laut travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

The palace has long been a fixture for locals and visitors alike, thanks to its extraordinary architecture, rich history, and colorful guardsmen. \n\nA tour of Deoksugung Palace will reveal its origins. Built during the Joseon Dynasty, Deoksugung Palace did not actually start out as a proper palace. It was originally constructed as the residence of a royal relative, but in 1592 it became a haven for King Seonju after all his other palaces in Seoul were destroyed by the Japanese. Over the centuries, Deoksugung Palace has been inhabited sporadically; starting in the 1600s, it was largely abandoned until 1897, when it was again utilized full-time by the royal family.   \n\nA major part of Deoksugung Palace sightseeing is the Changing of the Guard Ceremony. Guards glad in brilliant gold and purple uniforms perform this ceremony as they switch shifts three times a day. This coincides with the opening and shutting of the Daehanmun Gate, and is also accompanied by performances on musical instruments.

Below are some links to those recent videos. Feel free to compare with this clip and comment below to let us know which ones you prefer, and what else you\u2019d love to see from Expedia on YouTube!\n\nSt. Petersburg \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3ISUUO0CSo\n\nKyoto:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd1wzlwtKJ0\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to Gunung Mulu National Park. This 200-square mile nature preserve located in Malaysian Borneo contains a unique combination of caverns and rainforest, and you can see both when you arrive in this lush, ancient landscape. \n\nGunung Mulu National Park tours typically focus on its immense cave system. Over the years, hundreds of expeditions have been dispatched into its numerous underground cathedrals, though not all of them have been fully explored. Once inside, you can walk down miles of subterranean pathways that are set inside and beneath the twisting mountain ranges that form Gunung Mulu National Park. Don\u2019t worry; guides are available to take you safely through these silent wonders.  \n\nYour Gunung Mulu National Park tourism isn\u2019t limited to the underground, though. You can explore the surrounding rainforest that teems with wildlife, or embark on the longest canopy tour in the world. If you\u2019d like to see a greater swath of the park, hop into one of the many boats and take in the view from the river. At sunset, gather with other visitors at the Bat Observatory for a special treat: the Bat Exodus. Twelve species of these nocturnal creatures swarm out of the caves once the sun descends to begin their nightly hunting. It\u2019s a sight you won\u2019t soon forget!\n\nWhat did you enjoy the most during your sightseeing in Gunung Mulu National Park?\n\nVisit our Gunung Mulu National Park travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

This 200-square mile nature preserve located in Malaysian Borneo contains a unique combination of caverns and rainforest, and you can see both when you arrive in this lush, ancient landscape. \n\nGunung Mulu National Park tours typically focus on its immense cave system. Over the years, hundreds of expeditions have been dispatched into its numerous underground cathedrals, though not all of them have been fully explored. Once inside, you can walk down miles of subterranean pathways that are set inside and beneath the twisting mountain ranges that form Gunung Mulu National Park. Don\u2019t worry; guides are available to take you safely through these silent wonders.  \n\nYour Gunung Mulu National Park tourism isn\u2019t limited to the underground, though. You can explore the surrounding rainforest that teems with wildlife, or embark on the longest canopy tour in the world. If you\u2019d like to see a greater swath of the park, hop into one of the many boats and take in the view from the river. At sunset, gather with other visitors at the Bat Observatory for a special treat: the Bat Exodus. Twelve species of these nocturnal creatures swarm out of the caves once the sun descends to begin their nightly hunting. It\u2019s a sight you won\u2019t soon forget!\n\nWhat did you enjoy the most during your sightseeing in Gunung Mulu National Park?\n\nVisit our Gunung Mulu National Park travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

If you\u2019ve seen the movie \u201cThe Bridge on the River Kwai,\u201d then you already have an idea of what the conditions were like. You can also cross the titular bridge from that movie, which has since been partially rebuilt. \n\nReady to experience the natural beauty Kanchanaburi is famed for?

As a result of its quiet location, your Khao Lak tour will likely be very relaxing as you adapt to the slower pace of life in the area. Many of the locals live in huts on the seashore, or in small villages, and make their living via fishing and selling their wares to visitors. You won\u2019t find high-rise skyscrapers or fancy resorts in Khao Lak. Instead, you\u2019ll stay in charming, secluded accommodations that fit in perfectly with the area\u2019s natural surroundings. \n\nKhao Kal sightseeing no doubt includes a tour of the area\u2019s interior. Tropical jungles and beautiful waterfalls are located right on the coastline, so you can emerge from an exploration of the interior and splash right into the warm Andaman Sea. For even more natural beauty, head to Cheo Larn Lake, located right near Khao Lak. This 64-square mile freshwater lake is navigable by boat, and sports some truly stunning landscapes.

                    "description": "This video for Khao Lak is one of our older productions, but we wanted to share it with you to get some feedback on how these older clips compare to the more recent travel guides we\u2019ve shot. Below are some links to those recent videos. Feel free to compare with this clip and comment below to let us know which ones you prefer, and what else you\u2019d love to see from Expedia on YouTube!\n\nSt. Petersburg \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3ISUUO0CSo\n\nKyoto:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd1wzlwtKJ0\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to Khao Lak, a serene, quiet area nestled in Thailand\u2019s west coast.\n\nWhile full of appealing beaches and lush jungles, Khao Lak has not quite arrived on the tourism scene just yet. As a result of its quiet location, your Khao Lak tour will likely be very relaxing as you adapt to the slower pace of life in the area. Many of the locals live in huts on the seashore, or in small villages, and make their living via fishing and selling their wares to visitors. You won\u2019t find high-rise skyscrapers or fancy resorts in Khao Lak. Instead, you\u2019ll stay in charming, secluded accommodations that fit in perfectly with the area\u2019s natural surroundings. \n\nKhao Kal sightseeing no doubt includes a tour of the area\u2019s interior. Tropical jungles and beautiful waterfalls are located right on the coastline, so you can emerge from an exploration of the interior and splash right into the warm Andaman Sea. For even more natural beauty, head to Cheo Larn Lake, located right near Khao Lak. This 64-square mile freshwater lake is navigable by boat, and sports some truly stunning landscapes. Hop onto a wooden canoe and wind through limestone cliffs draped with lush greenery.\n\nHow will you spend your time in Khao Lak? \n\nVisit our Khao Lak travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

Additional Sam Roi Yot National Park sightseeing is made easy by walkways that wind through the freshwater marshes that make up much of the park\u2019s acreage. Bring binoculars to catch glimpses of over 300 types of birds inhabiting the marshes, as well as monkeys and deer in the forests clinging to the mountains. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to stop by the Kuha Karuhas Pavilion, a small structure nestled within a cave. This is the spot to pause, breathe in the scent of an unfamiliar landscape, and remember how small you are in the scope of the universe.\n\nWhat was your favorite part of Sam Roi Yot National Park?\n\nVisit our Sam Roi Yot National Park travel page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

Additional Sam Roi Yot National Park sightseeing is made easy by walkways that wind through the freshwater marshes that make up much of the park\u2019s acreage. Bring binoculars to catch glimpses of over 300 types of birds inhabiting the marshes, as well as monkeys and deer in the forests clinging to the mountains. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to stop by the Kuha Karuhas Pavilion, a small structure nestled within a cave. This is the spot to pause, breathe in the scent of an unfamiliar landscape, and remember how small you are in the scope of the universe.\n\nWhat was your favorite part of Sam Roi Yot National Park?\n\nVisit our Sam Roi Yot National Park travel page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

Whether you\u2019re looking to discover Dublin\u2019s extensive history or get a taste of the pub culture, you\u2019ll find it all on the eastern coast of Ireland. \n\nBegin your Dublin sightseeing by getting to know the city\u2019s past at the Kilmainham Gaol. This former prison, which dates back to 1796, most famously incarcerated nationalist leaders associated with the major rebellions, including the 1916 Easter Rising. The prison closed in 1924, and has since been restored as a museum focused on the story of Irish nationalism. Take a step back in history and embark on a guided tour of the largest unoccupied gaol in Ireland.\n\nFor more history lessons, continue your journey to the Christ Church Cathedral. It\u2019s considered the seat of the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Dublin, and manuscripts date it back to 1030. The establishment has experienced many changes and restorations over the years, making it a prime place to trace the city\u2019s history. Learn about King Henry VIII\u2019s role and the church\u2019s long rivalry with St. Patrick Cathedral. \n\nAfter dabbling in Dublin\u2019s past, head to Temple Bar to get a sense of the city\u2019s culture. This cobblestone strip is considered the heart of its nightlife, but truthfully, it\u2019s captivating at any time of the day. Spend an afternoon window shopping, and then step into one of the bars for a traditional pub experience\u2014you\u2019ll fit right in with a pint and a plate of pub fare. \n\nNo Dublin visit is complete without exploring the Guiness\u00ae Storehouse and the Old Jameson Distillery. The Guiness\u00ae Storehouse is home to the world\u2019s largest pint glass, but it\u2019s also where you can learn the story behind the popular stout and sip on the brew straight from the source. To keep the good times rolling, head across the River Liffey to the Old Jameson Distillery. Here you\u2019ll learn what three ingredients make up the famous whiskey, and you\u2019ll even have the opportunity to sip a signature Jameson cocktail. \n\nOn your next romp to Ireland, set out on Dublin tours for a peek into the country\u2019s largest city.

Teeming with deserted beaches and intriguing culture, Phuket belongs at the top of your travel itinerary. \n\nThe beaches are certainly the main attraction, and as soon as you catch a glimpse of the shore, you\u2019ll understand why. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for snorkeling off the coast or simply worshipping the sun from the shore, this is the place to do it. Stick to the tourist favorites, including Patong, Kata, and Banana Beach, or hop in a long-tail boat to cruise to the other nearby islands. You\u2019ll find crowded shores with a nightlife scene in beach towns like Patong, but also set aside time to escape to more secluded stretches such as Paradise Beach and Laem Singh Beach. \n\nMake time for some peace and quiet during your Phuket adventure. This island takes great pride in its religion and history, and the temples are a great place to get a sense of the region\u2019s spirituality. With 29 Buddhist temples scattered around the island, you have plenty to choose from. Search for the massive golden Buddha statue at Wat Khao Rang, or venture over to Wat Srisoonthorn to see the sleeping Buddha. From the Phuket Big Buddha to the Wat Phra Thong, you\u2019ll get your fair share of serenity while you\u2019re in town. \n\nIf you\u2019re ready to make some noise after visiting the silent temples, discover Phuket nightlife. Tourists tend to flock to Bangla Road in Patong, where the party never stops. From night markets to gogo bars, you\u2019ll find entertainment at every hour in this vibrant part of town. Prefer to catch some elaborate performances instead? The dazzling Phuket FantaSea is certainly one of the best things to do in Phuket, as it boasts trapeze artists, carnival rides, and stage productions. Dubbed a cultural theme park, FantaSea offers everything, including restaurants, shops, arcades, and theater shows. \n\nTake a dip in the inviting waters or join one of the Phuket tours. Whether your idea of a vacation is getting a little R&R at the seaside or dabbling in the region\u2019s culture, you can do both\u2014and more\u2014on your next trip to this picturesque island. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

Tourists tend to flock to Bangla Road in Patong, where the party never stops. From night markets to gogo bars, you\u2019ll find entertainment at every hour in this vibrant part of town. Prefer to catch some elaborate performances instead? The dazzling Phuket FantaSea is certainly one of the best things to do in Phuket, as it boasts trapeze artists, carnival rides, and stage productions. Dubbed a cultural theme park, FantaSea offers everything, including restaurants, shops, arcades, and theater shows. \n\nTake a dip in the inviting waters or join one of the Phuket tours. Whether your idea of a vacation is getting a little R&R at the seaside or dabbling in the region\u2019s culture, you can do both\u2014and more\u2014on your next trip to this picturesque island. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

                "description": "Imagine a sprawling, sweeping metropolis filled with over a million inhabitants. This was the city of Ayutthaya during the 1600s, when it was the glittering capital of Thailand. The onetime \u201cVenice of the East\u201d was destroyed by the Burmese in 1767. The city was burned to the ground, leaving behind only some monasteries and the remains of other buildings. \n\nFounded in 1350, Ayutthaya was a tremendous center of commerce and a focal point for art, religion, and politics. Head over to Wat Phra Si Sanphet, a temple you may recognize thanks to its three chedis, or towering, bell-shaped buildings. This temple once connected to the royal palace, though the connecting buildings were destroyed; today, you can wander through its crumbling red walls and marvel at what must have once been. \n\nGet ready for your Ayutthaya tour in nearby Bangkok, which is about 50 miles south of the ruins. In Bangkok, you can travel to Ayutthaya by boat, train, or rental car. Once you\u2019re in the vicinity, you can explore the area on foot, or rent a bike. For some true local flavor, hire a tuk-tuk (a motorized, three-wheeled cart) to carry you from place to place. \n\nA number of markets are set up outside the ruins, so you\u2019ll find plenty to eat after a long day of exploring the ruins. Sit back, enjoy some food, and watch as the sun sets on the ancient buildings. \n\nWhat do you hope to find during your Ayutthaya sightseeing?\n\nVisit our Ayutthaya travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/",

                    "description": "Imagine a sprawling, sweeping metropolis filled with over a million inhabitants. This was the city of Ayutthaya during the 1600s, when it was the glittering capital of Thailand. The onetime \u201cVenice of the East\u201d was destroyed by the Burmese in 1767. The city was burned to the ground, leaving behind only some monasteries and the remains of other buildings. \n\nFounded in 1350, Ayutthaya was a tremendous center of commerce and a focal point for art, religion, and politics. Head over to Wat Phra Si Sanphet, a temple you may recognize thanks to its three chedis, or towering, bell-shaped buildings. This temple once connected to the royal palace, though the connecting buildings were destroyed; today, you can wander through its crumbling red walls and marvel at what must have once been. \n\nGet ready for your Ayutthaya tour in nearby Bangkok, which is about 50 miles south of the ruins. In Bangkok, you can travel to Ayutthaya by boat, train, or rental car. Once you\u2019re in the vicinity, you can explore the area on foot, or rent a bike. For some true local flavor, hire a tuk-tuk (a motorized, three-wheeled cart) to carry you from place to place. \n\nA number of markets are set up outside the ruins, so you\u2019ll find plenty to eat after a long day of exploring the ruins. Sit back, enjoy some food, and watch as the sun sets on the ancient buildings. \n\nWhat do you hope to find during your Ayutthaya sightseeing?\n\nVisit our Ayutthaya travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

                "description": "Welcome to Cheow Larn Lake, where you can get back in touch with nature and relax amidst aquatic beauty.\n\nBefore your Cheow Larn Lake tour, brush up a little bit on its unique history. This manmade body of water was nonexistent before 1982, when the development of the Rajjaprabha Dam flooded a swath of jungle in southern Thailand. The new reservoir quickly attracted visitors who relished both the quiet it provided and its striking beauty.  \n\nCheow Larn Lake sightseeing begins in the floating huts where visitors reside. These huts actually hover on the lake\u2019s surface, bobbing gently up and down with the water.

This manmade body of water was nonexistent before 1982, when the development of the Rajjaprabha Dam flooded a swath of jungle in southern Thailand. The new reservoir quickly attracted visitors who relished both the quiet it provided and its striking beauty.  \n\nCheow Larn Lake sightseeing begins in the floating huts where visitors reside. These huts actually hover on the lake\u2019s surface, bobbing gently up and down with the water. This is not a vacation spot for those seeking flashing lights and high drama; instead, it is a peaceful return to nature, an extraordinary step back in time.\n\nIn the morning, go kayaking or embark on a boat tour of the reservoir, moving through emerald rainforest and the imposing limestone cliffs that surround Cheow Larn Lake.

When you venture into the cool, misty depths of this mountain wonderland, you\u2019ll be witness to some of the most exquisite landscapes in Malaysia.

This is a holdover from British times; the colonists brought their love of tea with them, and upon realizing tea plants could be grown in the Cameron Highlands, great rolling hills of plants appeared in the rolling highlands.

                "description": "https://www.expedia.com/Chiang-Mai.d890.Destination-Travel-Guides\n\n\nView our city guide video to see what it\u2019s like to travel to Thailand. The city of Chiang Mai has it all, from peaceful temples to enthralling bazaars. \n\nAs the largest city in Northern Thailand, Chiang Mai packs in a lot. There\u2019s no shortage of adventure in this city surrounded by mountains and dotted with temples. While there is certainly a lot to see and sample, Chiang Mai is considered a slightly sleepier, quieter town than its southern neighbor, Bangkok. \n\nChiang Mai takes great pride in retaining its traditions. The city\u2019s spirituality remains a significant element of the Thai culture, and the town\u2019s countless temples help keep its religious values alive. During your adventure in this part of Thailand, make a stop at the Wat Phra That on top of Doi Suthep. Built in 1383, the sacred temple was inspired by a local legend about a white elephant carrying a relic. While visiting the shrines, take a minute to soak up the sweeping views of Chiang Mai from the top of the Doi. Don\u2019t stop at just one temple, though; there are hundreds of others located in and around Chiang Mai. \n\nExploring the markets is another way to get a taste of the Thai culture, and you\u2019ll find some great eats at North Gate, South Gate, and Marorot Market, among countless others.

                    "description": "https://www.expedia.com/Chiang-Mai.d890.Destination-Travel-Guides\n\n\nView our city guide video to see what it\u2019s like to travel to Thailand. The city of Chiang Mai has it all, from peaceful temples to enthralling bazaars. \n\nAs the largest city in Northern Thailand, Chiang Mai packs in a lot. There\u2019s no shortage of adventure in this city surrounded by mountains and dotted with temples. While there is certainly a lot to see and sample, Chiang Mai is considered a slightly sleepier, quieter town than its southern neighbor, Bangkok. \n\nChiang Mai takes great pride in retaining its traditions. The city\u2019s spirituality remains a significant element of the Thai culture, and the town\u2019s countless temples help keep its religious values alive. During your adventure in this part of Thailand, make a stop at the Wat Phra That on top of Doi Suthep. Built in 1383, the sacred temple was inspired by a local legend about a white elephant carrying a relic. While visiting the shrines, take a minute to soak up the sweeping views of Chiang Mai from the top of the Doi. Don\u2019t stop at just one temple, though; there are hundreds of others located in and around Chiang Mai. \n\nExploring the markets is another way to get a taste of the Thai culture, and you\u2019ll find some great eats at North Gate, South Gate, and Marorot Market, among countless others. The night markets, Chiang Mai Night Bazaar in particular, are exceptional places to sample the local fare and mingle with the locals. Slurp up some noodles and nosh on some stir-fried dishes, or brave something you\u2019ve never tried before\u2014crickets and mealworms, anyone?

The Darwin region is home to over 20 national parks, so you can get a taste of the Australian outback without venturing too far from civilization. \n\nFor now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. \n\nMore travel information around Darwin: https://www.expedia.com/Darwin-Darwin-City-Centre.dx6131318\n\nSubscribe to Expedia\u2019s YouTube Channel for great travel videos and join the conversation on the best vacation ideas. \n \n---------\n\nFollow us on social media: \nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Expedia\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/expedia\n\n---------\n\n0:00 - Darwin\n1:00 - Mindil Beach Markets\n1:24 - Deck Chair Cinema\n1:32 - Defense of Darwin Experience & Australian Aviation Heritage Centre\n1:55 - Darwin Museum and Art Gallery\n2:24 - Crocodylus Park\n2:43 - Crocosaurus Cove\n3:07 - Litchfield National Park\n3:41 - Buley Rockhole\n4:03 - Tolmer and Wangi Falls\n4:29 - Kakadu National Park"

At the Grand Bazaar you\u2019ll find exotic snacks, jewelry, clothing, and everything else you could possibly hope for in an ancient shopping center.\n\nWhat do you hope to find when you are in Istanbul?   \n\nVisit our Istanbul travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/  \n"

Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders.

Getting to know this pocket powerhouse is a must for travelers seeking the blend between energy and tradition.\n\n\nWhen ready, browse vacation packages to Singapore: https://www.expedia.com/Singapore.d180027.Destination-Travel-Guides\n\nSmall and heavily populated, #Singapore is an easy place to #explore; nothing in the city is more than an hour from the business district. Thanks to modern construction and outstanding architecture, Singapore is rapidly becoming a powerhouse trade city, but it maintains ties to its Asian roots through traditional temples and many cultural hotspots. \n\nYour Singapore #tour must include the Botanical Gardens and Orchid Gardens, both beautiful and notable places to visit. If you\u2019re a fan of exotic animals, stop by the Singapore Zoo and check in with its 300-plus species. You can also take a \u201cbumboat\u201d from Changi Beach to Pulau Ubin, set away from the bustling city, and delight in its quiet mangroves. \n\nNo Singapore #vacation is complete without a visit to Marina Bay, a glowing, high-tech vision of the future, or Orchard Road, which boasts enough shopping to keep you occupied for several rainy afternoons.\n\n\nFor now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. \n\nMore travel information around Singapore: https://www.expedia.com/Singapore.dx3168\n\nSubscribe to Expedia\u2019s YouTube Channel for great travel videos and join the conversation on the best vacation ideas. \n\n---------\n\nFollow us on social media: \nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Expedia\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/expedia\n\n---------\n\n0:00 - Singapore\n1:09 - Chinatown\n1:20 - Buddha Tooth Relic Temple\n1:33 - Little India\n1:43 - Malay and Muslim Quater Kampong Glam\n1:52 - Boat and Clarke Quays\n2:13 - Singapore Botanic Gardens and National Orchid Garden\n2:35 - Bukit Timah Nature Reserve\n2:42 - Singapore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park\n3:07 - Orchard Road\n3:18 - Bugis Markets\n3:26 - Sentosa\n3:37 - Fort Siloso\n3:48 - East Coast Park\n4:02 - Changi Beach\n4:06 - Pulau Ubin\n4:22 - Raffles Hotel\n4:40 - Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay"

The city sprawls across a number of canals and waterways that connect the Everglades to the Atlantic Ocean. Though it seems to have kicked its reputation as a spring break party spot, Fort Lauderdale continues to have a laid-back atmosphere that attracts tourists year-round, especially snowbirds during the winter months. Filled to the brim with seaside attractions, historical memorabilia, and shopping spots, there\u2019s no shortage of excitement in this coastal community. \n\nIf the sea and sand are calling your name, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Fort Lauderdale has 23 miles of picturesque coastline, where you can soak up the sunshine and splash in the Atlantic Ocean. Many tourists and snowbirds make a beeline for \u201cThe Strip,\u201d a scenic oceanfront stretch, located near the bars and restaurants on Sunrise Boulevard. \n\nThere\u2019s more to this enticing location than just the shoreline, though. To get a sense of the city\u2019s history, venture over to the Riverwalk. One of the most popular Fort Lauderdale attractions, the Riverwalk is where you\u2019ll find the Stranahan House, which is considered one of the oldest buildings in town. Originally built as a trading post in 1901, it was converted into a home for the Stranahans, a pioneer family, five years later. Tour a replica 1899 classroom, and then mosey over to the King Cromartie House just across the street. \n\nWhile Fort Lauderdale tours belong on the top of your itinerary, there are other must-see attractions just outside of town. Visit Butterfly World in nearby Coconut Creek to gaze at the winged creatures fluttering around the country\u2019s largest butterfly house, and cast a line at the Deerfield Fishing Pier. Birch State Park is a serene spot for wildlife watching, while Mizner Park is home to upscale restaurants, galleries, and shops.\n\nCome explore Fort Lauderdale for a slice of sunshine. Whether you\u2019re looking to shop along Las Olas Boulevard or mosey around the New River downtown scene, Fort Lauderdale sightseeing opportunities are seemingly endless.

Some 3.5 million people ride it annually, making it one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most popular tourist attractions. The Eye operates late into the evening, making it a perfect way to cap off a busy day of sightseeing. Believe us, if you thought London was lovely in the daylight, wait till you see it from the London Eye during the night\u2014the city, lit up, is a glittering sight you\u2019ll never forget.\n\nClimb into one of the 32 air conditioned gondolas, sit down (or stand up!), and enjoy a London Eye tour. Every half-hour, the wheel completes a rotation, meaning you get a full 30 minutes to see the capital city from a height and angle previously only reachable by birds. On a clear day, you can see up to 25 miles in all directions. Now that\u2019s a breathtaking view.\n\nHave you ridden on the London Eye?

Some 3.5 million people ride it annually, making it one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most popular tourist attractions. The Eye operates late into the evening, making it a perfect way to cap off a busy day of sightseeing. Believe us, if you thought London was lovely in the daylight, wait till you see it from the London Eye during the night\u2014the city, lit up, is a glittering sight you\u2019ll never forget.\n\nClimb into one of the 32 air conditioned gondolas, sit down (or stand up!), and enjoy a London Eye tour. Every half-hour, the wheel completes a rotation, meaning you get a full 30 minutes to see the capital city from a height and angle previously only reachable by birds. On a clear day, you can see up to 25 miles in all directions. Now that\u2019s a breathtaking view.\n\nHave you ridden on the London Eye? What did you think?\n\nVisit our London Eye travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/expedia\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: \nhttp://viewfinder.expedia.com/"

As you walk through its imposing brownstones and take in the spectacular views of New York City, you\u2019ll see why over 2.5 million people call it home. \n\nWith all those residents, Brooklyn is the most densely populated of the five New York City boroughs. It\u2019s also among the most beautiful; just stop by Brooklyn Bridge Park to see what we mean. You\u2019ll find 85 acres of parkland framed by the New York City skyline and the famous Brooklyn Bridge\u2014it\u2019s the perfect place to take pictures. Over 4,000 pedestrians cross the Brooklyn Bridge to and from Manhattan each day\u2014lots of them with cameras in hand. \n\nContinue your Brooklyn sightseeing at Coney Island. Once the biggest theme park in the U.S., Coney Island is still full of classic attractions; visit Nathan\u2019s Famous Hot Dogs, scream your way through the Cyclone roller coaster (maybe not in that order), and ride the carousel. Once you\u2019ve had your fill of the rides and the food, you can slip down to the beach that runs alongside the boardwalk and relax until the sun goes down. \n\nHave you crossed the Brooklyn Bridge?

As you walk through its imposing brownstones and take in the spectacular views of New York City, you\u2019ll see why over 2.5 million people call it home. \n\nWith all those residents, Brooklyn is the most densely populated of the five New York City boroughs. It\u2019s also among the most beautiful; just stop by Brooklyn Bridge Park to see what we mean. You\u2019ll find 85 acres of parkland framed by the New York City skyline and the famous Brooklyn Bridge\u2014it\u2019s the perfect place to take pictures. Over 4,000 pedestrians cross the Brooklyn Bridge to and from Manhattan each day\u2014lots of them with cameras in hand. \n\nContinue your Brooklyn sightseeing at Coney Island. Once the biggest theme park in the U.S., Coney Island is still full of classic attractions; visit Nathan\u2019s Famous Hot Dogs, scream your way through the Cyclone roller coaster (maybe not in that order), and ride the carousel. Once you\u2019ve had your fill of the rides and the food, you can slip down to the beach that runs alongside the boardwalk and relax until the sun goes down. \n\nHave you crossed the Brooklyn Bridge?
