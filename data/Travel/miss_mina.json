This time we\u2019re checking out some spots in Issaquah, Kirkland and Bothell. We\u2019re no Indian food experts, but we are food adventurers and I studied each restaurant\u2019s menu and reviews extensively to ensure we order the yummiest dishes :)\n\nWe also pick up Indian snacks at a local Indian grocery shop called Maurya (it has a restaurant too!). Then we take a digestive walk at Juanita Beach Park and the Old Market Street Trail. Hope we can travel again to Indian someday soon, but for now we experience Indian food and culture in Washington State. We wish you enjoy this video!

Our coastal foraging adventures take place around gorgeous sunsets and also a very rainy & windy night. Eventually we do catch razor clams! Woohoo! I learn how to clean & process them. Also cook and eat them for the first time! It\u2019s a long video and I did my best to make it fun & informative as possible, so feel free to refer to the video chapters below.

                    "description": "We go razor clamming in Washington State! Specifically we dig the Pacific Razor Clams (it's said the salt method is not effective for this species). It\u2019s our first time razor clamming and we end up taking three trips. Lessons are learned from each experience due to varying weather conditions and gear. Our coastal foraging adventures take place around gorgeous sunsets and also a very rainy & windy night. Eventually we do catch razor clams! Woohoo! I learn how to clean & process them. Also cook and eat them for the first time! It\u2019s a long video and I did my best to make it fun & informative as possible, so feel free to refer to the video chapters below.

The license must be in the harvester's immediate possession and available for inspection during harvest and transport. Diggers may not harvest any part of another person\u2019s daily limit, except for persons that possess a Designated Harvesters\u2019 Card.\u201d - WDFW\n\nBefore harvesting, check the beach to determine if a beach is open or if there are any health restrictions by calling the Marine Biotoxin Hotline at 1-800-562-5632 or by visiting the Washington Department of Health\u2019s marine biotoxins webpage: https://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/Shellfish/RecreationalShellfish/Illnesses/Biotoxins \n\nCurrent razor clam season info: https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/shellfishing-regulations/razor-clams#current\nHow to dig razor clams: https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/basics/digging-razor-clams\nRazor clam beaches: https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/shellfishing-regulations/razor-clams#beachmaps \nShellfish Safety Map (click areas for detailed info): https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/biotoxin/biotoxin.html \nForum on cleaning/preserving razor clams: https://www.ifish.net/threads/cleaning-razor-clams-the-next-day-best-way-to-preserve.441436/ \nCleaning/processing razor clams, Link 1: http://delectablemusings.com/2012/05/razor-clams-part-2-cleaning-and-storing.html?m=1\nCleaning/processing razor clams, Link 2: https://www.seriouseats.com/razor-clam-guide \nClams & Rain (Herald Net): https://www.heraldnet.com/life/even-a-newbie-can-have-fun-hunting-for-razor-clams/ \nClams & Rain (Seattle Pi): https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Outdoors-Report-Weather-rains-on-razor-clam-1218725.php \n\nRAZOR CLAM GEAR:\nMy Wader Boots: https://amzn.to/3zjnNRT\nThe Claminator $$$: https://amzn.to/3qDbTOM\nA More Affordable Clam Gun: https://amzn.to/3EU8KPA\nThe Clam Bag I bought: https://amzn.to/3qN5PTM\nTrenching Shovel (similar to what I used): https://amzn.to/3pSdBg9\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc \nOther videos you might like: \n\u25cb GROWING MUSHROOMS AT HOME (Episode 1): https://youtu.be/RR6OfcN1LY8 \n\u25cb COASTAL FORAGING - Seaweed & Butter Clams: https://youtu.be/JMa6x1NVKG0 \n\u25cb Camping in Our Backyard: https://youtu.be/hMBjgBnIb04 \n\n\ud83d\ude18 Subscribe to my channel: http://bit.ly/MissMinaYT \n\ud83d\udc55 Get my shirt: http://bit.ly/MissMinaMerch \n\ud83c\udfb5 Music in this video (affiliate link): https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/zo01l7\n\ud83c\udfa5 MY CAMERA & VLOGGING GEAR: https://www.missmina.co/blog/my-2020-vlogging-gear \n\nMORE MINA: \n\u25cb Instagram: @missminaoh \n\u25cb TikTok: @missminaoh \n\u25cb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh \n\u25cb Twitter: @missminaoh \n\n\u25ba MY KOREA CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/sweetandtasty\n\u25ba MY ARTS & CRAFTS CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/c/CreativeChillout"

Turns out the Airbnb host\u2019s great grandfather built a secret distillery during the 1920s Prohibition and even made a mineshaft using dynamites. Yes, you can walk in the mineshaft! This land has history and I love the great grandfather\u2019s DIY style.  \n\nI also check out a couple restaurants and go on a beautiful nature walk. The golden fall foliage at Blackbird Island and Waterfront Park was stunning! The bright yellow leaves from head to toe made my jaw drop. Just magical :) Washington State is rich with amazing scenery, so of course we must check out Icicle Canyon. All this and more! Watch the full video for all the details :)\n\nPlease keep in mind that Washington State has distinct seasons. In this video, you'll witness its beauty in autumn.

I\u2019m going on a solo trip again, but this time to Mason County. It\u2019s my first time visiting this part of Washington. I\u2019m not sure what to expect. Haven\u2019t heard anything about this area before lol. While it\u2019s fun to visit major cites, I also like to explore obscure places. \n\nSometimes I make detailed itineraries. This time I\u2019m traveling at a slower pace. It\u2019s a calm trip filled with nature, exploring the local town, and talking about random stuff. Even found my personal treasure at an antique shop! One thing leads to another and sometimes the best things happen without advanced planning. \n\nHope you enjoy this vlog filled with relaxing moments!\n\nVIDEO CHAPTERS: \n0:00 Preview of what\u2019s in the video\n0:27 Intro\n1:03 Chill Drive\n1:19 Checking into Airbnb\n1:32 Yeah, sometimes I\u2019m random\n1:54 Kayaking\n2:20 Breakfast & Talk\n3:16 Eating Bokksu Snacks with Mommy Oh\n5:54 Exploring the Area on a Rainy Day\n6:08 Local Shopping Begins!\n7:39 Garden & Botanicals Shop\n8:27 Antique & Thrift Shop: Found My Treasure!\n10:29 A Beautiful Rainy Drive\n10:41 Back at the Tiny House & Talk\n11:35 Making Breakfast\n12:13 Another Random Talk: On \u201cSuperfoods\u201d\n13:18 Morning Ritual\n13:55 Check out of Airbnb\n15:03 Lunch at an Italian Restaurant\n17:51 The Korean chest in my office!!!\n18:14 Outtakes\n19:01 Grocery Shopping before Airbnb\n19:41 Race against the sunset\n20:28 Popeye & his spinach, Me & my rain\n21:08 I despise daylight savings.

For two nights, Mommy Oh and I stayed in their cottage suite, which has its own entrance so you get privacy from the main house. I give you a detailed tour of the room and our Airbnb host Jacob gives us a tour of the rest of the magical property. \n\nTurns out there\u2019s also a glamping tent with its own hot tub, outdoor kitchen, and bathroom. Near the stone bridge is a mini tree house surrounded by a moat and pond, accessible by a wooden bridge. At the time, it was in development and might become a bar, sauna, or another Airbnb room! Also coming soon is a campsite next to a creek. \n\nWatch the video for the full tour and other places to check out in the area! We filmed this video in October, so there were mushrooms and Halloween decorations.

                    "description": "Welcome to the Enchanting Cottage of Olalla, Washington! I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when I discovered this house online and had to see it in person. For two nights, Mommy Oh and I stayed in their cottage suite, which has its own entrance so you get privacy from the main house. I give you a detailed tour of the room and our Airbnb host Jacob gives us a tour of the rest of the magical property. \n\nTurns out there\u2019s also a glamping tent with its own hot tub, outdoor kitchen, and bathroom. Near the stone bridge is a mini tree house surrounded by a moat and pond, accessible by a wooden bridge. At the time, it was in development and might become a bar, sauna, or another Airbnb room! Also coming soon is a campsite next to a creek. \n\nWatch the video for the full tour and other places to check out in the area! We filmed this video in October, so there were mushrooms and Halloween decorations. Depending on the season you visit, your experience will be different than mine :)\n\nStay at the Olalla Forest Retreat: \n\u25cb Book the Suite in the Storybook Cottage: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/45193050 \n\u25cb Book the Glamping Tent: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/49775472\n\nVIDEO CHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro & Sneak Peek\n0:43 Room Tour\n4:55 Full House Tour with Host\n6:24 Brief History of How House Came To Be\n8:10 The Den\n9:26 Honeymoon Suite\n10:35 The Flintstone Room\n11:48 Hallway to the Stairs and a Super Quiet Room\n12:17 Outdoor Kitchen\n12:41 Glamping Tent with Hot Tub\n14:24 Tree House Made with Tree Trunk\n16:06 What it\u2019s like in the Spring\n16:57 Giant Lobster Mushroom!\n17:16 Campsite Coming Soon, next to the creek\n18:01 A Cute Distraction\n18:18 The Wooden Stairs lead to a Hot Tub\n19:07 Morning Ritual & Breakfast\n19:58 Hobbit House.

So if there\u2019s a specific restaurant you really want to try, be sure to check their updated hours of operation before your trip! \n\nWatch my TINY CABIN TOUR: https://youtu.be/yqrIlpdnGI8\n\nVIDEO CHAPTERS: \n0:00 Intro\n1:20 Breakfast: Cheesy Crepes (aka: thin pancakes with fillings)\n3:30 A beautiful nature walk at Bloedel Reserve\n4:34 Cute baby frogs jumping around\n5:15 Japanese Garden\n5:35 The Residence (omg the flowers and vibe)\n6:12 Mushrooms! \n6:25 Lunch at the Italian Market & Kitchen\n8:57 More pizza and pasta review\n9:42 Checking into the Airbnb\n10:03 Dinner at Vietnamese Restaraunt\n12:27 Drinks at Bar Hitchcock\n12:45 Snacks at the Market\n13:21 Breakfast: Sandwiches in Bavarian-style town\n14:30 Meditative walk at Labyrinth\n18:00 Walking around a historic park & forest lagoon\n18:54 Exploring the graffiti building\n19:50 Shopping in downtown\n21:07 Lunch: Baguette Sandwiches at Food Stand\n21:29 Visiting the Art Museum :)\n22:03 Going Home: The scenic Ferry Ride to Seattle\n23:09 Snack Review: Green Fermented Seed Crisps\n25:36 Outtakes & Bonus Footage\n28:51 Service award goes to\u2026\n\nFEATURED FOOD:\nCheesy Veggie Crepe\nMagnifique Crepe\nChai Tea\nBurrata & Speck Pizza with Flash-Fried Basil\nPorcini & Wild Mushroom Pasta\nTaro Egg Rolls with Pork and Wood-ear Mushrooms\nPan-seared Scallops & Shishito Peppers\nBun Cha Hanoi with Pork Skewers\nUbe Panna Cotta with Fresh Mango & Blueberries\nDrinks: Red Wine & B.I. 129\nAgate Pass Sandwich\nEgg & Cheese Breakfast Sandwich\nChai Tea again, but this time with Oat Milk\nBaguette Sandwiches\nGreen Fermented Seed Crisps\n\n\ud83d\ude18 Subscribe for more munchies: http://bit.ly/MissMinaYT \n\ud83d\udc55 Get my shirt: http://bit.ly/MissMinaMerch \n\ud83c\udfb5 Where I got my music (affiliate link): https://artlist.io/Mina-1579506\n\ud83c\udfa5 MY CAMERA & VLOGGING GEAR: https://www.missmina.co/blog/my-2020-vlogging-gear \n\nOther videos you might like: \n\u25cb TINY HOUSE TOUR \ud83c\udf32 Mini Cabin on Wooded Farmland: https://youtu.be/wSVW9I3uDhI\n\u25cb KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN TOUR: https://youtu.be/DxDBEgEeIGg\n\u25cb TRAVELING ALONE AGAIN: https://youtu.be/G-omJI4fPxI\n\n\u25ba MY KOREA CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/sweetandtasty \n\u25ba MY ASMR CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgm1l8BX7Ek3AiwEr4VtRCg \n\nMORE MINA: \n\u25cb Instagram: @missminaoh \n\u25cb TikTok: @missminaoh \n\u25cb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\n\u25cb Twitter: @missminaoh \n\nNote: This video was filmed in August 2021.

I usually make Food & Travel videos on this channel, but today I share with you another big part of my life\u2026. ART \u2764\ufe0f Some of you already got glimpses of it on Instagram @missminaoh I\u2019m doing the official introduction on YouTube today! \n\nA little background: Art has been a huge presence since I was a kid. Always had arts & crafts projects at home throughout grade school. Went to art college, but eventually went digital with YouTube. In recent years I prioritized making travel videos and put art to the side (art as in creating physical objects like painting on canvas). I occasionally did a sketch here and there, but didn\u2019t keep a daily practice. When traveling extensively, it\u2019s challenging to bring all the art supplies. I\u2019m all about packing light as possible. Also, the heartbreak of supplies and work getting lost/damaged/stolen while traveling! \n\nSo I channeled all my energy and resources into making travel videos. And even before making travel content, I was moving around quite a bit between countries. But due to covid and changing travel restrictions, I stopped traveling abroad and finally was able to make time & space to practice art on a regular basis again. \n\nMy return to art during the pandemic was initially an attempt to overcome some difficult emotions related to past trauma that kept resurfacing. It\u2019s my first time mentioning this because it\u2019s been a difficult year for many of us and I wanted to keep my videos upbeat. I won\u2019t get too detailed about it yet, but just giving some background as to how art became a bigger part of my life again. Art is an outlet and it helped me express feelings that I couldn\u2019t get out through journaling and other mediums. The dark colors made me feel understood while the brighter and lighter colors helped lift my spirits. \n\nMommy Oh and I paused on international travel, so now I\u2019m traveling through colors, shapes and textures.

                "description": "I'm thrilled to finally give you an update on the mushrooms I've been growing at home! The reishi took some time to fully mature and it was totally worth the wait. It's my first time growing reishi and I had a brain fart: thought the grow kit would produce Ganoderma Lingzhi, but actually, the strain used for this kit is the Antler Reishi (Ganoderma multipilium). Thus why they look more like antlers than an umbrella. \n\nReishi are not your typical grocery store mushrooms. Because of their tough texture and bitterness, it's frequently enjoyed as a tea (definitely not as a pizza topping haha). Watch the full video to see the process from beginning to end! And witness the tea making with dasima (kelp) and sesame oil. \n\nPrevious \"Growing Mushrooms at Home\" video (episode 1): https://youtu.be/RR6OfcN1LY8\nWhere I got my Antler Reishi grow kit: http://bit.ly/AntlerReishiGrowKit\n\n\ud83d\ude18 Subscribe for more munchies: http://bit.ly/MissMinaYT\n\ud83d\udc55 Get my shirt: http://bit.ly/MissMinaMerch\n\ud83c\udfb5 Where I got my music (affiliate link): https://artlist.io/Mina-1579506\n\ud83c\udfa5 MY CAMERA & VLOGGING GEAR: https://www.missmina.co/blog/my-2020-vlogging-gear\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nOther videos you might like:\n\u25cb Catching DUNGENESS CRABS by Kayak \ud83e\udd80 CATCH & COOK on Lopez Island: https://youtu.be/UThzG7Uihw0\n\u25cb KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN TOUR: https://youtu.be/DxDBEgEeIGg\n\u25cb COASTAL FORAGING in Washington State: https://youtu.be/JMa6x1NVKG0\n\n\u25ba MY KOREA CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/sweetandtasty\n\u25ba MY ASMR CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgm1l8BX7Ek3AiwEr4VtRCg\n\nMORE MINA: \n\u25cb Instagram: @missminaoh\n\u25cb TikTok: @missminaoh\n\u25cb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\n\u25cb Twitter: @missminaoh\n\nNote: This video was filmed between December 2020 to May 2021.

                    "description": "I'm thrilled to finally give you an update on the mushrooms I've been growing at home! The reishi took some time to fully mature and it was totally worth the wait. It's my first time growing reishi and I had a brain fart: thought the grow kit would produce Ganoderma Lingzhi, but actually, the strain used for this kit is the Antler Reishi (Ganoderma multipilium). Thus why they look more like antlers than an umbrella. \n\nReishi are not your typical grocery store mushrooms. Because of their tough texture and bitterness, it's frequently enjoyed as a tea (definitely not as a pizza topping haha). Watch the full video to see the process from beginning to end! And witness the tea making with dasima (kelp) and sesame oil. \n\nPrevious \"Growing Mushrooms at Home\" video (episode 1): https://youtu.be/RR6OfcN1LY8\nWhere I got my Antler Reishi grow kit: http://bit.ly/AntlerReishiGrowKit\n\n\ud83d\ude18 Subscribe for more munchies: http://bit.ly/MissMinaYT\n\ud83d\udc55 Get my shirt: http://bit.ly/MissMinaMerch\n\ud83c\udfb5 Where I got my music (affiliate link): https://artlist.io/Mina-1579506\n\ud83c\udfa5 MY CAMERA & VLOGGING GEAR: https://www.missmina.co/blog/my-2020-vlogging-gear\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nOther videos you might like:\n\u25cb Catching DUNGENESS CRABS by Kayak \ud83e\udd80 CATCH & COOK on Lopez Island: https://youtu.be/UThzG7Uihw0\n\u25cb KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN TOUR: https://youtu.be/DxDBEgEeIGg\n\u25cb COASTAL FORAGING in Washington State: https://youtu.be/JMa6x1NVKG0\n\n\u25ba MY KOREA CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/sweetandtasty\n\u25ba MY ASMR CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgm1l8BX7Ek3AiwEr4VtRCg\n\nMORE MINA: \n\u25cb Instagram: @missminaoh\n\u25cb TikTok: @missminaoh\n\u25cb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\n\u25cb Twitter: @missminaoh\n\nNote: This video was filmed between December 2020 to May 2021.

To be safe, don\u2019t eat snow when it first begins to fall. Wait a couple hours. The exact amount of time to wait varies on environmental factors. \n\n+ Location is a big factor. In urban areas, snow becomes contaminated faster due to pollutants from car exhaust. However snow in non-industrial rural areas tend to be safer. It is advised to not eat the snow near a factory or other pollutant-causing spots. If you\u2019re unsure about your location, this air quality map may be a helpful resource: https://waqi.info/\n\n+ Avoid eating dirty snow. If it\u2019s yellow, brown, pink due to algae, or any color, don\u2019t eat it! If you eat dirty snow, you can get sick. Also avoid plowed snow. \n\n+ Avoid eating snow that\u2019s been sitting around. The longer the snow sits, the more chemicals accumulate. Old snow can have dirt blown over the top of it, thus contaminating it. According to an experiment in Romania, half-day old snow is safe to eat especially in colder months. By two days, the snow is not safe to eat. (Source: Seattle Times, see link below)\n\n+ Be sure your hands are clean while gathering the snow you plan to eat. Also make sure you put the snow in a clean bowl or container. Basically treat this snow as any other food since it\u2019s going in your mouth. \n\n+ In this video, we only eat the upper layers of thick, untouched snow that is away from vehicular traffic. In our situation, it was snowing overnight and all day. Fresh snow kept piling on. After it gathered over 7 inches, we scooped up the top part of the clean snow. Do not eat snow that is directly touching the ground. \n\n+ What is a safe amount of snow to eat? This will vary for different places around the world. If it\u2019s your first time eating snow and you\u2019re not sure, a few flakes likely won\u2019t hurt. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to remember that the presence of contaminants in air, soil, food, water or even snow does not necessarily mean high exposure hazards and associated risks of disease. This depends on the types of contaminants, the concentrations of them, and the amount or duration of exposure. Accordingly, the typical childhood experience of munching on a handful of snow is relatively harmless. In most cases it would be more harmful to drink water directly from most lakes or rivers, and even that depends on several factors.\u201d - Wexner Medical\n\nThere are varying opinions on eating snow.

We are thrilled to partner up with Bokksu again and travel to Japan through our taste buds! Hope you guys enjoy the yummy and fun unboxing as much as we have \u2661 \n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nToday we go on a deeper dive into the Japanese food scene of Seattle, Washington! We discover a place that sells beautifully prepared bento boxes filled with sashimi, uni, ikura (salmon caviar), yuzu tobiko, and more. The Unagi Ju-Box reminds us of the grilled eel we tried three years ago in Narita, Japan. And oh my, the Yuzu Panna Cotta is eye-poppingly delicious! A must for dessert lovers who enjoy tangy flavors. \n\nFor dinner we head northwest from Downtown Seattle for the Midnite Ramen food truck. Tonight they are collaborating with Yoroshiku. Options include various ramen, Wagyu curry donuts, and yakitori. \n\nOver the weekend, we grab some treats from the Japanese bakery: Chicken Katsu Sandwich, Mont Blanc, Creamy Cereal Donut, Azuki Donut, and S'mores Croissant. While these are not traditionally Japanese, they have made their own versions of it in a very tasty way. These desserts become part of the modern Japanese food culture. For example, Mont Blanc is originally from Europe and is commonly seen in Tokyo (that's where I first came across it in fact!). \n\nWhen visiting the Pacific Northwest, you must soak in some greenery.

We are thrilled to partner up with Bokksu again and travel to Japan through our taste buds! Hope you guys enjoy the yummy and fun unboxing as much as we have \u2661 \n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nToday we go on a deeper dive into the Japanese food scene of Seattle, Washington! We discover a place that sells beautifully prepared bento boxes filled with sashimi, uni, ikura (salmon caviar), yuzu tobiko, and more. The Unagi Ju-Box reminds us of the grilled eel we tried three years ago in Narita, Japan. And oh my, the Yuzu Panna Cotta is eye-poppingly delicious! A must for dessert lovers who enjoy tangy flavors. \n\nFor dinner we head northwest from Downtown Seattle for the Midnite Ramen food truck. Tonight they are collaborating with Yoroshiku. Options include various ramen, Wagyu curry donuts, and yakitori. \n\nOver the weekend, we grab some treats from the Japanese bakery: Chicken Katsu Sandwich, Mont Blanc, Creamy Cereal Donut, Azuki Donut, and S'mores Croissant. While these are not traditionally Japanese, they have made their own versions of it in a very tasty way. These desserts become part of the modern Japanese food culture. For example, Mont Blanc is originally from Europe and is commonly seen in Tokyo (that's where I first came across it in fact!). \n\nWhen visiting the Pacific Northwest, you must soak in some greenery. There is so much nature in Washington State. In this video we show you a spot called Discovery Park. The paths lead to the beach and West Point Lighthouse where you can catch the golden sunset. \n\nHope you guys enjoy this food exploration!

It's a last-minute trip, but we're making it happen \ud83d\ude1c My initial plan was to sleep alone, but Mommy Oh joins with her hammer as protection (she almost brought a cooking pan instead lol). To be honest, I do get a little anxious sleeping in a tent outdoors (I feel vulnerable, especially as a non-muscular woman), so any company is much appreciated! \n\nWe set up tent near the machete man's path, then roast sweet potatoes and grill Chicken Sausage & Veggie Skewers. And of course, no camping is complete without some s'mores! We make our own version using crispy chocolate chip cookies and marshmallow. Oh boy, was it tasty. I highly recommend this combo.

It's a last-minute trip, but we're making it happen \ud83d\ude1c My initial plan was to sleep alone, but Mommy Oh joins with her hammer as protection (she almost brought a cooking pan instead lol). To be honest, I do get a little anxious sleeping in a tent outdoors (I feel vulnerable, especially as a non-muscular woman), so any company is much appreciated! \n\nWe set up tent near the machete man's path, then roast sweet potatoes and grill Chicken Sausage & Veggie Skewers. And of course, no camping is complete without some s'mores! We make our own version using crispy chocolate chip cookies and marshmallow. Oh boy, was it tasty. I highly recommend this combo.

Paid partnerships help me to continue making videos and save up for future trips so I can film and share more awesome places around the world. During these challenging times, I've been making donations to small businesses and nonprofit organizations, so paid videos are a win-win situation. I personally love Bokksu's curated boxes with informative guidebooks and hope you enjoy their delicious selection of snacks as much as I have \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nDuring the summer in Japan, we took the train to the mountainous Gunma Prefecture and stayed at a ryokan (a traditional Japanese inn with communal baths). Gunma is known for its onsen (hot springs) and there are plenty of ryokans, but we give Sekizenkan a shot. Can you believe it's over 300 years old? And the red bridge served as a model for Ghibli Studio's \"Spirited Away.\" \n\nThe neighborhood is filled with greenery and calm. No crowds when we went, so fellow introverts, you will especially love it here! Made up of 3 buildings and 8 floors, Sekizenkan has at least 6 main bathing options. Some bathhouses are communal while others are private. Some are mixed gender, others have separate baths for men and women. Depending on your room type, you may get a private bath as well. If you need time away from the city and want to take it slow, this is the place. Watch the video for the full tour! We even go through a mysterious tunnel. \n\nFor current updates & rates: https://bit.ly/sekizenkan\n\n\ud83d\ude18 Subscribe for more munchies: http://bit.ly/MissMinaYT\n\ud83d\udc55 Get my shirt: http://bit.ly/MissMinaMerch\n\ud83c\udfa5 MY CAMERA & VLOGGING GEAR: https://www.missmina.co/blog/my-2020-vlogging-gear\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nOther videos you might like:\n\u25cb TOKYO CAPSULE HOTEL TOUR: https://youtu.be/gNhBiw9pgUo\n\u25cb JAPANESE STREET FOOD: https://youtu.be/DQbPQ8GZBo4\n\u25cb Japanese PRISON THEMED Restaurant in Tokyo: https://youtu.be/_H_ITYhNMYU\n\n\u25ba MY KOREA CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/sweetandtasty\n\u25ba MY ASMR CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgm1l8BX7Ek3AiwEr4VtRCg\n\nMORE MINA: \n\u25cb Instagram: @missminaoh\n\u25cb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\n\u25cb Twitter: @missminaoh\n\nThis video was filmed in July 2019.

Paid partnerships help me to continue making videos and save up for future trips so I can film and share more awesome places around the world. During these challenging times, I've been making donations to small businesses and nonprofit organizations, so paid videos are a win-win situation. I personally love Bokksu's curated boxes with informative guidebooks and hope you enjoy their delicious selection of snacks as much as I have \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nDuring the summer in Japan, we took the train to the mountainous Gunma Prefecture and stayed at a ryokan (a traditional Japanese inn with communal baths). Gunma is known for its onsen (hot springs) and there are plenty of ryokans, but we give Sekizenkan a shot. Can you believe it's over 300 years old? And the red bridge served as a model for Ghibli Studio's \"Spirited Away.\" \n\nThe neighborhood is filled with greenery and calm. No crowds when we went, so fellow introverts, you will especially love it here! Made up of 3 buildings and 8 floors, Sekizenkan has at least 6 main bathing options. Some bathhouses are communal while others are private. Some are mixed gender, others have separate baths for men and women. Depending on your room type, you may get a private bath as well. If you need time away from the city and want to take it slow, this is the place. Watch the video for the full tour! We even go through a mysterious tunnel. \n\nFor current updates & rates: https://bit.ly/sekizenkan\n\n\ud83d\ude18 Subscribe for more munchies: http://bit.ly/MissMinaYT\n\ud83d\udc55 Get my shirt: http://bit.ly/MissMinaMerch\n\ud83c\udfa5 MY CAMERA & VLOGGING GEAR: https://www.missmina.co/blog/my-2020-vlogging-gear\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nOther videos you might like:\n\u25cb TOKYO CAPSULE HOTEL TOUR: https://youtu.be/gNhBiw9pgUo\n\u25cb JAPANESE STREET FOOD: https://youtu.be/DQbPQ8GZBo4\n\u25cb Japanese PRISON THEMED Restaurant in Tokyo: https://youtu.be/_H_ITYhNMYU\n\n\u25ba MY KOREA CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/sweetandtasty\n\u25ba MY ASMR CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgm1l8BX7Ek3AiwEr4VtRCg\n\nMORE MINA: \n\u25cb Instagram: @missminaoh\n\u25cb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\n\u25cb Twitter: @missminaoh\n\nThis video was filmed in July 2019.

The featured dish in this vlog is Falafel Salad, which is probably the most nutritious airplane food I ever had thus far. A bit salty yet diverse toppings including pumpkin seeds and sweet potato.

A complimentary meal did not come on this red-eye flight, so I ordered a meal upon boarding. You can pre-book meals before your flight. The featured dish in this vlog is Falafel Salad, which is probably the most nutritious airplane food I ever had thus far. A bit salty yet diverse toppings including pumpkin seeds and sweet potato.

This time we're showing you what their vegetarian food is like. AirAsia is a budget airline. The base cost for our flight was about $35 US per person (prices may vary). To select seats, check in baggage and order food, it comes at an additional cost. We got the Value Pack for an additional $13 US per person, which includes 20kg baggage allowance, seat selection, and one meal. The ride from Cebu to Manila is 1 to 1.5 hours, but we wanted to take the opportunity to show you what the food is like.

This time we're showing you what their vegetarian food is like. AirAsia is a budget airline. The base cost for our flight was about $35 US per person (prices may vary). To select seats, check in baggage and order food, it comes at an additional cost. We got the Value Pack for an additional $13 US per person, which includes 20kg baggage allowance, seat selection, and one meal. The ride from Cebu to Manila is 1 to 1.5 hours, but we wanted to take the opportunity to show you what the food is like. Hope you enjoy this video!\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nOther videos you might like:\n\u25cb 5-STAR RESORT TOUR IN CEBU: https://youtu.be/CF2nKpOiFOk\n\u25cb MANILA CHINATOWN FOOD TOUR: https://youtu.be/Ys8F7IbBFFQ\n\u25cb LUNCH BUFFET IN MANILA at 5 Star Hotel: https://youtu.be/EwA82RukcV8\n\n\u25ba MY KOREA CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/sweetandtasty\n\u25ba MY ASMR CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgm1l8BX7Ek3AiwEr4VtRCg\n\nMORE MINA: \n\u25cb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\n\u25cb Twitter: @missminaoh\n\u25cb Snapchat: MissMinaOh\n\nCAMERA & EQUIPMENT:\n\u25cb Main camera: http://amzn.to/2BCvTqq\n\u25cb My lens: http://amzn.to/2kh5g6h\n\u25cb Microphone: http://amzn.to/2ANBgD7\n\u25cb Wind shield for microphone: http://amzn.to/2jEGWY0\n\u25cb Camera used for \"Throwback Thursday-ish\": https://amzn.to/2Hnlw01\n\nDisclosure: This post may contain affiliate links, which means I may receive a commission if you click a link and purchase something that I have recommended.

There was a lot of winging and learning on-the-go. Years later I'm here to lay it all down in a concise and organized manner as possible. It might sound like a ton of things to do, but some tasks you only need to do once in awhile. For example, U.S. passport holders are required to renew every 10 years. With every trip you take, everything gets easier with practice! Wishing you safe travels wherever you go, sooner or later \u2661\n\nNote: This video is sponsored by Care/of.

Watch the video to see the flight experience unfold :)\n\nThis video is sponsored by Phuket Marriott Resort & Spa, Merlin Beach.\n\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\nOther videos you might like:\n\u25cb Hong Kong Airlines Economy Food: https://youtu.be/-K2IxXoVhBE\n\u25cb Nasi Lemak on AirAsia: https://youtu.be/IFYBDoJEYFg\n\u25cb Chinese Airplane Food: https://youtu.be/N6k-xvVhXoo\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE MUNCHIES! https://www.youtube.com/missminaoh/?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25ba MY OTHER CHANNEL! http://www.youtube.com/sweetandtasty\n\u25ba GET MY SHIRT! https://teespring.com/stores/miss-mina-ohs-store\n\nMORE MINA: \n\u25cb Instagram: @missminaoh\n\u25cb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\n\u25cb Twitter: @missminaoh\n\u25cb Snapchat: MissMinaOh\n\nCAMERA & EQUIPMENT\n\u25cb Main camera: http://amzn.to/2BCvTqq\n\u25cb My lens: http://amzn.to/2kh5g6h\n\u25cb Microphone: http://amzn.to/2ANBgD7\n\u25cb Wind shield for microphone: http://amzn.to/2jEGWY0\n\u25cb Camera used for \"Throwback Thursday-ish\": https://amzn.to/2Hnlw01\n\nWHERE I GET MY MUSIC: http://share.epidemicsound.com/lRPQQ\n\nDisclosure: This post may contain affiliate links, which means I may receive a commission if you click a link and purchase something that I have recommended.

Mommy Oh bites into Curry Croquette that brings back childhood memories. The kabocha squash filling is aromatic and we couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it even hours later. I dive into a bowl of rice topped with sashimi. Paired with shiso leaves, it tastes like the weekend! Conclusion: we are coming back for more. But next time for dinner, so we can sit in the outdoor courtyard :)\n\nThis video is created in partnership with JINS Eyewear. Information and our glasses are provided by JINS (except for the rainbow glasses I ordered at the end. I bought them because... could not resist lol).\n\nJINS offers a variety of affordable, high-quality & stylish frames designed in Tokyo. All metal frame parts are sourced exclusively from Japan.

On our first night, we stay in a spacious modern room. For the second night, we are transferred to a traditional Japanese style room, but end up moving to another modern room. Why? Watch the video to find out! And also get delicious close-ups of artfully prepared kaiseki dishes :)\n\nThanks so much to Fei for kindly booking this baller hotel for my 30th birthday!

                "description": "Many of our fellow viewers have been asking me: How do you stay slim after eating so much? Today I'm showing you what I eat on a daily basis (particularly for breakfast)! On-camera, I eat everything from street food to raw meat to bugs. Off-camera, I balance it all out with a more calm diet, one that consists largely of vegetables. Of course, I'd love to eat flavorful food every single meal! But in terms of health, one must practice a little discipline :) \n\nIn every meal-prepping session, I cook about seven containers of veggies and eat a serving for breakfast everyday with a handful of nuts or sun-dried tomatoes. I might have a second container for lunch or dinner, usually paired with salmon. \n\nThis is the sort of meal-prepping while traveling (when I have access to a kitchen, which is why I prefer staying at Airbnbs instead of hotels). Hope you guys found this helpful! \n\n*******\n\nMY MERCH SHOP: http://bit.ly/2soYCwn\nGet Munchies Mandala shirt today! http://bit.ly/2sOyKe7\n\nMORE MINA: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/missminaoh/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/missminaoh\nSnapchat: MissMinaOh\n\nMY KOREA CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sweetandtasty\n\nMusic from Epidemicsound.com\n#mealprep #healthyliving #veggiesgalore #veganstyle #veganbreakfast",

                    "description": "Many of our fellow viewers have been asking me: How do you stay slim after eating so much? Today I'm showing you what I eat on a daily basis (particularly for breakfast)! On-camera, I eat everything from street food to raw meat to bugs. Off-camera, I balance it all out with a more calm diet, one that consists largely of vegetables. Of course, I'd love to eat flavorful food every single meal! But in terms of health, one must practice a little discipline :) \n\nIn every meal-prepping session, I cook about seven containers of veggies and eat a serving for breakfast everyday with a handful of nuts or sun-dried tomatoes. I might have a second container for lunch or dinner, usually paired with salmon. \n\nThis is the sort of meal-prepping while traveling (when I have access to a kitchen, which is why I prefer staying at Airbnbs instead of hotels). Hope you guys found this helpful! \n\n*******\n\nMY MERCH SHOP: http://bit.ly/2soYCwn\nGet Munchies Mandala shirt today! http://bit.ly/2sOyKe7\n\nMORE MINA: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/missminaoh/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/missminaoh\nSnapchat: MissMinaOh\n\nMY KOREA CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sweetandtasty\n\nMusic from Epidemicsound.com\n#mealprep #healthyliving #veggiesgalore #veganstyle #veganbreakfast"

Pork Satay are marinated, skewered and grilled meats. They are served with Ketupat (rice cooked in coconut leaf casing). We take a stroll along the Petitenget Beach, stopping by La Plancha for a mango lassi. While we're on this side of the island, we also venture to Nyang Nyang Beach.

From street food to experiencing the local life to crashing a wedding (kinda), it\u2019s all in this travel vlog. We start off the day with a Balinese breakfast prepared by my host mother. Then my host father Jiwa, whom I hired to drive me around for the day, takes us off the beaten path. We get a peep into gamelan (traditional ensemble music) and condong (Balinese dance) practices. \n\nOn the way to eat Santan Kemangi (fried gurame fish with coconut milk and basil), we stop by the Puppet Shop where a craftman creates headdresses, costumes and more. At the water temple Tirta Empul, we get spiritual cleansing. Then soak in the view of rice terraces. Watch the video to see the eventful day unfold! \n\nFEATURED PLACES (in order of appearance): \n+ SMKN 3 Sukawati (in Batubulan) \n+ Stone carving shop (8\u00b036'24.2\"S 115\u00b015'09.5\"E)\n+ Prapen Jewelry & Artifacts\n+ Puppet Shop (8\u00b035\u201931.1\u201dS, 115\u00b016\u201934.7\u201dE)\n+ Warung Mina (8\u00b036'39.0\"S 115\u00b013'14.9\u201dE) \n+ Bakso Stall (sorry guys, exact location unknown) \n+ Gunung Kawi\n+ Pura Tirta Empul\n+ Tegallalang Rice Terrace\n+ Village of White Herons \n\nNote: This video was filmed in October 2016.

                    "description": "Ready or not, we\u2019re going on a full-day Bali adventure! From street food to experiencing the local life to crashing a wedding (kinda), it\u2019s all in this travel vlog. We start off the day with a Balinese breakfast prepared by my host mother. Then my host father Jiwa, whom I hired to drive me around for the day, takes us off the beaten path. We get a peep into gamelan (traditional ensemble music) and condong (Balinese dance) practices. \n\nOn the way to eat Santan Kemangi (fried gurame fish with coconut milk and basil), we stop by the Puppet Shop where a craftman creates headdresses, costumes and more. At the water temple Tirta Empul, we get spiritual cleansing. Then soak in the view of rice terraces. Watch the video to see the eventful day unfold! \n\nFEATURED PLACES (in order of appearance): \n+ SMKN 3 Sukawati (in Batubulan) \n+ Stone carving shop (8\u00b036'24.2\"S 115\u00b015'09.5\"E)\n+ Prapen Jewelry & Artifacts\n+ Puppet Shop (8\u00b035\u201931.1\u201dS, 115\u00b016\u201934.7\u201dE)\n+ Warung Mina (8\u00b036'39.0\"S 115\u00b013'14.9\u201dE) \n+ Bakso Stall (sorry guys, exact location unknown) \n+ Gunung Kawi\n+ Pura Tirta Empul\n+ Tegallalang Rice Terrace\n+ Village of White Herons \n\nNote: This video was filmed in October 2016.

Today we're trying three types of Korean shaved ice: Real Green Tea Bingsoo (\ub9ac\uc5bc \uadf8\ub9b0\ud2f0 \uc124\ube59), Fresh Strawberry Tiramisu Bingsoo (\uc0dd\ub538\uae30 \ud2f0\ub77c\ubbf8\uc218 \uc124\ube59), and Red Bean Injeolmi Bingsoo (\ud325 \uc778\uc808\ubbf8 \uc124\ube59). Which one wins the taste flavor? Watch to find out! Also, I answer a commonly asked question: How do you not get fat after eating all that food? I reveal my diet secrets with you.

Today we're trying three types of Korean shaved ice: Real Green Tea Bingsoo (\ub9ac\uc5bc \uadf8\ub9b0\ud2f0 \uc124\ube59), Fresh Strawberry Tiramisu Bingsoo (\uc0dd\ub538\uae30 \ud2f0\ub77c\ubbf8\uc218 \uc124\ube59), and Red Bean Injeolmi Bingsoo (\ud325 \uc778\uc808\ubbf8 \uc124\ube59). Which one wins the taste flavor? Watch to find out! Also, I answer a commonly asked question: How do you not get fat after eating all that food? I reveal my diet secrets with you. Which make them not so much a secret :) \n\nThe camera I filmed this video with: http://amzn.to/2isP1PK\nThe newer model of my camera: http://amzn.to/2j7X5ES\n\nMY MERCH SHOP: http://bit.ly/2soYCwn\nGet Munchies Mandala shirt today! http://bit.ly/2sOyKe7\n\nMORE MINA: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/missminaoh/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/missminaoh\nSnapchat: MissMinaOh\n\nMY KOREA CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sweetandtasty\n\nDisclosure: This post may contain affiliate links, which means I may receive a commission if you click a link and purchase something that I have recommended.

You are cordially invited to prepare a meal and eat with me :)\n\nFeatured questions: \n8:15 How do I know what I want? \n9:50 Are there any vaccinations required to travel to South Korea? \n10:20 Which university should I go to? \n13:05 I feel like I'm constantly lost. How do you stay motivated? \n16:25 Why is dating so hard these days? \n19:20 How do you maintain your inner peace?\n20:55 Most of the time you travel by yourself. Don't you ever feel lonely? \n22:48 I often hear a woman shouldn't travel on her own. Don't you sometimes feel lonely or scared? Could you give some advice? \n24:50 Honestly do you prefer traveling alone or in small groups? \n26:25 When you don't want to go to the gym, what do you think of to motivate yourself? \n26:56 How is it like to eat out alone in Korea? Do a lot of people stare at you? \n28:10 How come you don't stay with family when visiting South Korea? Like how come you get an Airbnb? \n30:13 How do you deal with existential crisis? \n\nThe camera I filmed this video with: http://amzn.to/2isP1PK\nThe newer model of my camera: http://amzn.to/2j7X5ES\n\nMY MERCH SHOP: http://bit.ly/2soYCwn\nGet Munchies Mandala shirt today! http://bit.ly/2sOyKe7\n\nMORE MINA: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/missminaoh/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/missminaoh\nSnapchat: MissMinaOh\n\nMY KOREA CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sweetandtasty\n\nDisclosure: This post may contain affiliate links, which means I may receive a commission if you click a link and purchase something that I have recommended.

Upon a taste review, I answer your questions regarding travel, food and life. You are cordially invited to prepare a meal and eat with me :)\n\nFeatured questions: \n8:15 How do I know what I want? \n9:50 Are there any vaccinations required to travel to South Korea? \n10:20 Which university should I go to? \n13:05 I feel like I'm constantly lost. How do you stay motivated? \n16:25 Why is dating so hard these days? \n19:20 How do you maintain your inner peace?\n20:55 Most of the time you travel by yourself. Don't you ever feel lonely? \n22:48 I often hear a woman shouldn't travel on her own. Don't you sometimes feel lonely or scared? Could you give some advice? \n24:50 Honestly do you prefer traveling alone or in small groups? \n26:25 When you don't want to go to the gym, what do you think of to motivate yourself? \n26:56 How is it like to eat out alone in Korea? Do a lot of people stare at you? \n28:10 How come you don't stay with family when visiting South Korea? Like how come you get an Airbnb? \n30:13 How do you deal with existential crisis? \n\nThe camera I filmed this video with: http://amzn.to/2isP1PK\nThe newer model of my camera: http://amzn.to/2j7X5ES\n\nMY MERCH SHOP: http://bit.ly/2soYCwn\nGet Munchies Mandala shirt today! http://bit.ly/2sOyKe7\n\nMORE MINA: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/missminaoh/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/missminaoh\nSnapchat: MissMinaOh\n\nMY KOREA CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sweetandtasty\n\nDisclosure: This post may contain affiliate links, which means I may receive a commission if you click a link and purchase something that I have recommended.

For round three, we have dessert in the Old Quarter. We also check out West Lake, a temple, the Tran Quoc Pagoda, search for a cafe that serves egg coffee and more!

My childhood friend joins us for the food adventure as we share a huge family-style plate of injera and wot. She likes meat and I like veggies, so we order the Vegetarian and Meat Combo. Be sure to wash your hands because they're the traditional utensils used for eating Ethiopian food. We then attempt our very first gursha! It's a bonding moment where you feed others at the table :)\n\nZeni Ethiopian Restaurant\n1320 Saratoga Ave\nSan Jose, CA 95129\n\nVegetarian combo comes with ye-miser wot (lentil), ye-kik alitcha (split peas), atalkelt wot (vegetables), ye-gomen wot and ye timatim fitfit.\n\nMeat combo comes with ye-beg alitcha wot (lamb), doro wot (chicken), kitfo (beef) and homemade cottage cheese.\n\nMORE MINA: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/missminaoh/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/missminaoh\nSnapchat: MissMinaOh\n\nMY OTHER CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sweetandtasty\n\nMusic from Epidemicsound.com\n#ethiopian #food #adventures",

Though spanning only one block on Lombard Street, this windy road of eight turns attracts plenty of tourists and their selfies. For a more scenic view of the city, off we head to Coit Tower. A must-visit place on a clear day, especially for observing the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, Transamerica Pyramid and more! \n\nMORE MINA: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/missminaoh/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/missminaoh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/missminaoh\nSnapchat: MissMinaOh\n\nMY OTHER CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sweetandtasty\n\nMusic from Epidemicsound.com\n#travel #sanfrancisco #sightsee"
