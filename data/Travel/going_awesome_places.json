Have questions?  Drop a comment here as well so I can pass them along and also hopefully answer them in future videos.\n\n\ud83d\udd36 PEAK DESIGN COUPONS: Use code TOP20-6J4L-2YGE to get 20% off orders of $100 or greater by heading to https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 CHAPTERS\n0:00 - Intro\n1:01 - What is Mobile?\n1:53 - Mobile features\n2:46 - Kickstarter is live!\n3:19 - Start of unboxing\n3:41 - Shipping box\n6:35 - Everyday Case\n9:22 - Car Mount\n11:02 - Bike Mount Pro\n13:22 - Mobile Tripod\n15:32 - Wall Mount\n17:02 - Universal Mount\n19:37 - What about Apple iPhone 12 MagSafe?\n20:20 - Outro\n\n\ud83d\udd34 WATCH MORE MOBILE BY PEAK DESIGN\n- Everyday Case Deep Dive - https://youtu.be/lWBSgxngw7Y\n- Wall Mount accessory - https://youtu.be/Hx4UHGoS3E4\n- Mobile Tripod is my favourite and here's why - https://youtu.be/ne_HS9J49q4\n- MagSafe compatibility - https://youtu.be/yqRurrlQ_4w\n\n\ud83d\udc95 Up your awesome level with a subscribe :) https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube (here's a one-up \ud83c\udf44)\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 WHAT GEAR DO I USE?\n\u25b6 Backpack -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-travel-backpack\n\u25b6 Day Sling -                 https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-everyday-sling\n\u25b6 Camera Body -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus-omd-em1-mk3\n\u25b6 Best Video Lens -     https://goingawesomeplaces.com/panasonic-10-25-lens\n\u25b6 Super Wide Lens -    https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 All Purpose Lens -   https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Super Zoom Lens -  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 GoPro -                      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/gopro-hero-8\n\u25b6 Shotgun Mic  -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Lav Mics  -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/tascam-dr10l\n\u25b6 Primary tripod -        https://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\u25b6 Video Light -             https://goingawesomeplaces.com/aputure-al-mx\n\u25b6 Shoes -                      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/keen-explore-vent\n\u25b6 Sunglasses -             https://goingawesomeplaces.com/maui-jim-chee-hoo\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - https://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 MERCH - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/store\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\n\u25b6 MUSIC BY Epidemic Sound - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Insurance: https://goingawesomeplaces.com/world-nomads-travel-insurance\n\u25b6 Hotels: https://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com\n\u25b6 Flights: https://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\u25b6 Airbnb (sign up for a new account to get FREE credit): https://goingawesomeplaces.com/airbnb-free-credit \n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nWebsite: https://goingawesomeplaces.com\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces\n\n#peakdesign #mobile #kickstarter"

                "description": "With many of you spending a lot more time working from home, it's time to level up your home office. This video breaks down the full step-by-step instructions on how to make your own wood shelves.  You'll quickly learn that DIY walnut wood shelves are a lot easier to do and just how easy and cheap it can be.\n\nThis is the first part of the Level Up Your Home Office series now that we're all spending a ton more time at home.  The shelve were a big part of the makeover and as someone with minimal wood working experience, I was surprised at how good this project turned out.  If I can do it, you guys can totally do it too!\n\n\ud83d\udfe7 Project Steps\n0:00 - Intro\n1:08 - Buying wood\n2:05 - Buying stain and polyurethane\n2:21 - Buying sandpaper\n2:26 - Buying foam brush\n2:33 - Tools used\n3:49 - Weathering\n4:27 - Sanding\n5:39 - Pre-Stain\n7:19 - Staining\n9:07 - Second coating of stain\n10:38 - Polyurethane semi-gloss coating\n11:53 - Installing the shelves\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 Project Costs\nAssuming you have a lot of the basics at home, here's everything else you'll need to buy:\n- Black shelf brackets x 4 - $27.99 x 2\n- Two 1x8x8 Knotty Pine boards - $15.99 x 2\n- Minwax Gel Stain (Walnut) - $18.99\n- Minwax Polyurethane (Semi-Gloss)  - $12.99\n- Sandpaper 220 grit - $4.99\n- Sandpaper 120 grit - $4.99\n- Foam Brush - $3.49\nTOTAL = $133.43 CAD\n\nThe cost may seem high but I found a similar designer shelf by West Elm (https://www.westelm.com/products/linear-wood-shelves-walnut-d7586/) which is $270 USD 2 foot (24\") and 3 foot (36\") shelf which is significantly shorter than the two lengths featured here (44\" and 73\") \n\nThe main power tool you'll need for this project is a Finishing or Circular sander (https://goingawesomeplaces.com/makita-finishing-sander)\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Black Shelf Brackets\nI purchased these off of Amazon \nCanada (Black) - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/black-triangle-shelf-brackets\nUS (Gold) - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/gold-triangle-shelf-brackets\n\n\ud83d\udd37 Feedback\nOverall, this was super easy to do and I wanted to really show all the steps from buying to staining and mounting. I think the only part that was a little weird was the \u201cweathering\u201d. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s absolutely necessary as all I managed to do was put in some dents and rough lines on the surface that you can barely notice so it\u2019s a step you can totally skip.\n\n \u2699\ufe0f FULL KIT\nAll gear used in the home office: https://kit.co/goingawesomeplaces/home-office-set-up-with-sit-stand-desk\n\n\u2b50Save 5% on ergonofis with 5AWESOME through https://goingawesomeplaces.com/ergonofis Black Friday, save 15% on desks, accessories (minus the Neat Cabinet), and chair from Nov 12 - Dec 3.\n\n\ud83d\udd36WATCH MORE FROM THE SERIES\nergonofis Shift 2.0 Standing Desk review - https://youtu.be/jVPO7gNIsEs\nFull home office tour -  https://youtu.be/6-8tPWmpXTE\nHow to DIY your own console table - https://youtu.be/CTC04LkHy1M\n\n\ud83d\udc95 Up your awesome level with a subscribe :) https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube (here's a one-up \ud83c\udf44)\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 WHAT GEAR DO I USE?\n\u25b6 Backpack -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-travel-backpack\n\u25b6 Day Sling -                 https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-everyday-sling\n\u25b6 Camera Body -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus-omd-em1-mk3\n\u25b6 Killer Video Lens -    https://goingawesomeplaces.com/panasonic-10-25-lens\n\u25b6 Super Wide Lens -    https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 All Purpose Lens -   https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Super Zoom Lens -  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 GoPro -                      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/gopro-hero-8\n\u25b6 Shotgun Mic  -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Lav Mics  -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/tascam-dr10l\n\u25b6 Primary tripod -        https://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\u25b6 Video Light -             https://goingawesomeplaces.com/aputure-al-mx\n\u25b6 Shoes -                      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/keen-explore-vent\n\u25b6 Sunglasses -             https://goingawesomeplaces.com/maui-jim-chee-hoo\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - https://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 MERCH - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/store\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\n\u25b6 MUSIC BY Epidemic Sound - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Insurance: https://goingawesomeplaces.com/world-nomads-travel-insurance\n\u25b6 Hotels:       https://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com\n\u25b6 Flights:      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nWebsite: https://goingawesomeplaces.com\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces\n\n#diy #shelves #homeoffice",

                    "title": "Easy DIY Walnut Wood Shelves | Level Up Your Home Office",
                    "description": "With many of you spending a lot more time working from home, it's time to level up your home office. This video breaks down the full step-by-step instructions on how to make your own wood shelves.  You'll quickly learn that DIY walnut wood shelves are a lot easier to do and just how easy and cheap it can be.\n\nThis is the first part of the Level Up Your Home Office series now that we're all spending a ton more time at home.  The shelve were a big part of the makeover and as someone with minimal wood working experience, I was surprised at how good this project turned out.  If I can do it, you guys can totally do it too!\n\n\ud83d\udfe7 Project Steps\n0:00 - Intro\n1:08 - Buying wood\n2:05 - Buying stain and polyurethane\n2:21 - Buying sandpaper\n2:26 - Buying foam brush\n2:33 - Tools used\n3:49 - Weathering\n4:27 - Sanding\n5:39 - Pre-Stain\n7:19 - Staining\n9:07 - Second coating of stain\n10:38 - Polyurethane semi-gloss coating\n11:53 - Installing the shelves\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 Project Costs\nAssuming you have a lot of the basics at home, here's everything else you'll need to buy:\n- Black shelf brackets x 4 - $27.99 x 2\n- Two 1x8x8 Knotty Pine boards - $15.99 x 2\n- Minwax Gel Stain (Walnut) - $18.99\n- Minwax Polyurethane (Semi-Gloss)  - $12.99\n- Sandpaper 220 grit - $4.99\n- Sandpaper 120 grit - $4.99\n- Foam Brush - $3.49\nTOTAL = $133.43 CAD\n\nThe cost may seem high but I found a similar designer shelf by West Elm (https://www.westelm.com/products/linear-wood-shelves-walnut-d7586/) which is $270 USD 2 foot (24\") and 3 foot (36\") shelf which is significantly shorter than the two lengths featured here (44\" and 73\") \n\nThe main power tool you'll need for this project is a Finishing or Circular sander (https://goingawesomeplaces.com/makita-finishing-sander)\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Black Shelf Brackets\nI purchased these off of Amazon \nCanada (Black) - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/black-triangle-shelf-brackets\nUS (Gold) - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/gold-triangle-shelf-brackets\n\n\ud83d\udd37 Feedback\nOverall, this was super easy to do and I wanted to really show all the steps from buying to staining and mounting. I think the only part that was a little weird was the \u201cweathering\u201d. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s absolutely necessary as all I managed to do was put in some dents and rough lines on the surface that you can barely notice so it\u2019s a step you can totally skip.\n\n \u2699\ufe0f FULL KIT\nAll gear used in the home office: https://kit.co/goingawesomeplaces/home-office-set-up-with-sit-stand-desk\n\n\u2b50Save 5% on ergonofis with 5AWESOME through https://goingawesomeplaces.com/ergonofis Black Friday, save 15% on desks, accessories (minus the Neat Cabinet), and chair from Nov 12 - Dec 3.\n\n\ud83d\udd36WATCH MORE FROM THE SERIES\nergonofis Shift 2.0 Standing Desk review - https://youtu.be/jVPO7gNIsEs\nFull home office tour -  https://youtu.be/6-8tPWmpXTE\nHow to DIY your own console table - https://youtu.be/CTC04LkHy1M\n\n\ud83d\udc95 Up your awesome level with a subscribe :) https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube (here's a one-up \ud83c\udf44)\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 WHAT GEAR DO I USE?\n\u25b6 Backpack -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-travel-backpack\n\u25b6 Day Sling -                 https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-everyday-sling\n\u25b6 Camera Body -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus-omd-em1-mk3\n\u25b6 Killer Video Lens -    https://goingawesomeplaces.com/panasonic-10-25-lens\n\u25b6 Super Wide Lens -    https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 All Purpose Lens -   https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Super Zoom Lens -  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 GoPro -                      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/gopro-hero-8\n\u25b6 Shotgun Mic  -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Lav Mics  -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/tascam-dr10l\n\u25b6 Primary tripod -        https://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\u25b6 Video Light -             https://goingawesomeplaces.com/aputure-al-mx\n\u25b6 Shoes -                      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/keen-explore-vent\n\u25b6 Sunglasses -             https://goingawesomeplaces.com/maui-jim-chee-hoo\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - https://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 MERCH - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/store\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\n\u25b6 MUSIC BY Epidemic Sound - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Insurance: https://goingawesomeplaces.com/world-nomads-travel-insurance\n\u25b6 Hotels:       https://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com\n\u25b6 Flights:      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nWebsite: https://goingawesomeplaces.com\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces\n\n#diy #shelves #homeoffice"

                "description": "The big Nile cruise ships seem to be the most popular choice but the secret is something called a Dahabiya which is a sail boat that runs from Luxor to Aswan and vice versa that's 100 times better.  Watch to see a full walkthrough of the Dahabiya Loulia with Djed Egypt Travel and why this is the BEST way to do a river Nile cruise on your next trip to Egypt.  Open this up to learn more \u2193\n\nThese are twin-mast sailing ships that are designed after the boats of the same name in the late 1800s and early 1900s when early explorers and archeologists were travelling up and down the Nile.

I slurp through the city to find out that a bowl of ramen isn't just a bowl. Open this up to learn more \u2193\n\n\ud83d\udd37 THE RAMEN SERIES - TOKYO RAMEN GUIDE\nAfter the tremendous success of last year's Must-Eat Restaurants in Tokyo, I knew I wanted to come back again but this time focus on a specific type of food and really go deep.  This is the second in the Ramen Tour Slurp Series about ramen.  Get hungry watching and start planning that trip to Japan!\n\n\ud83d\udd30READ THE FULL GUIDE AND ACCESS THE MAP:  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/best-ramen-in-tokyo-japan/\n\n\ud83d\udd30DO YOU KNOW YOUR RAMEN ETIQUETTE?\nhttps://goingawesomeplaces.com/how-to-eat-ramen-in-japan-etiquette-rules\n\n\ud83c\udf5c SLURP UP\n0:30 - Hiroshi from Ramen Beast. Book your tour and down the app at http://ramenbeast.com\n0:49 - Fuunji in Shinjuku\n3:55 - Kikanbo in Kando\n7:28 - Musashiya in Kichijoji\n9:38 - Matador in Kita-senju\n12:59 - Kagari in Ginza\n\nSo ultimately you're going to be thinking, which one is THE BEST?  Now that one's a hard one to answer but if I had to choose out of these 5, I have to give it up to Kikanbo for being just such a unique ramen experience that does it for me in terms of the ramen, the environment, and whole experience.  It's probably the most put together from a traveller perspective - they've really put some serious effort to make it friendly and ultimately creating a killer spicy miso bowl of ramen.\n\nAll opinions are my own of course!\n\nNote that normally video is a sensitive topic as you're only allowed to photography the food but thanks to Ramen Beast's relationship with the ramen masters, we were allowed to film inside and behind the scenes.\n\n\ud83d\udc9bMake sure to follow Hiroshi of Ramen Beast on IG at https://instagram.com/hshimakage\n\n\ud83d\udc95Awesome people subscribe :) https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube \n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 WHAT GEAR DO I USE?\n\u25b6 Backpack -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-travel-backpack\n\u25b6 Camera Body -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Super Wide Lens -    https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14 (used this most of the time)\n\u25b6 All Purpose Lens -   https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Super Zoom Lens -  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 GoPro -                      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/goprohero5\n\u25b6 GoPro Stick -            https://goingawesomeplaces.com/gopro-3way-grip\n\u25b6 Shotgun Mic  -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Lav Mics  -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/tascam-dr10l\n\u25b6 Primary tripod -        https://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\u25b6 Video Light -             https://goingawesomeplaces.com/aputure-al-mx\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - http://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\n\u25b6 MUSIC BY Epidemic Sound - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Insurance: https://goingawesomeplaces.com/world-nomads-travel-insurance\n\u25b6 Hotels: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com \n\u25b6 Flights: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\u25b6 Airbnb (get a new account to get FREE credit): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/airbnb-free-credit\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nWebsite: https://goingawesomeplaces.com\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces\n\n\n#tokyo #japan #ramen",

I slurp through the city to find out that a bowl of ramen isn't just a bowl. Open this up to learn more \u2193\n\n\ud83d\udd37 THE RAMEN SERIES - TOKYO RAMEN GUIDE\nAfter the tremendous success of last year's Must-Eat Restaurants in Tokyo, I knew I wanted to come back again but this time focus on a specific type of food and really go deep.  This is the second in the Ramen Tour Slurp Series about ramen.  Get hungry watching and start planning that trip to Japan!\n\n\ud83d\udd30READ THE FULL GUIDE AND ACCESS THE MAP:  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/best-ramen-in-tokyo-japan/\n\n\ud83d\udd30DO YOU KNOW YOUR RAMEN ETIQUETTE?\nhttps://goingawesomeplaces.com/how-to-eat-ramen-in-japan-etiquette-rules\n\n\ud83c\udf5c SLURP UP\n0:30 - Hiroshi from Ramen Beast. Book your tour and down the app at http://ramenbeast.com\n0:49 - Fuunji in Shinjuku\n3:55 - Kikanbo in Kando\n7:28 - Musashiya in Kichijoji\n9:38 - Matador in Kita-senju\n12:59 - Kagari in Ginza\n\nSo ultimately you're going to be thinking, which one is THE BEST?  Now that one's a hard one to answer but if I had to choose out of these 5, I have to give it up to Kikanbo for being just such a unique ramen experience that does it for me in terms of the ramen, the environment, and whole experience.  It's probably the most put together from a traveller perspective - they've really put some serious effort to make it friendly and ultimately creating a killer spicy miso bowl of ramen.\n\nAll opinions are my own of course!\n\nNote that normally video is a sensitive topic as you're only allowed to photography the food but thanks to Ramen Beast's relationship with the ramen masters, we were allowed to film inside and behind the scenes.\n\n\ud83d\udc9bMake sure to follow Hiroshi of Ramen Beast on IG at https://instagram.com/hshimakage\n\n\ud83d\udc95Awesome people subscribe :) https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube \n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 WHAT GEAR DO I USE?\n\u25b6 Backpack -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-travel-backpack\n\u25b6 Camera Body -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Super Wide Lens -    https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14 (used this most of the time)\n\u25b6 All Purpose Lens -   https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Super Zoom Lens -  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 GoPro -                      https://goingawesomeplaces.com/goprohero5\n\u25b6 GoPro Stick -            https://goingawesomeplaces.com/gopro-3way-grip\n\u25b6 Shotgun Mic  -          https://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Lav Mics  -                https://goingawesomeplaces.com/tascam-dr10l\n\u25b6 Primary tripod -        https://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\u25b6 Video Light -             https://goingawesomeplaces.com/aputure-al-mx\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - http://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\n\u25b6 MUSIC BY Epidemic Sound - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Insurance: https://goingawesomeplaces.com/world-nomads-travel-insurance\n\u25b6 Hotels: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com \n\u25b6 Flights: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\u25b6 Airbnb (get a new account to get FREE credit): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/airbnb-free-credit\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nWebsite: https://goingawesomeplaces.com\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces\n\n\n#tokyo #japan #ramen"

Open this up to learn more \u2193\n\nI totally get it - as good as the tour companies are at describing their product, it's hard to get a real sense of what it's like to be on the tour.  That's why I focused on capturing what it's like to be on a Flying Kiwi Tour behind the scenes from the beginning of the day to the end of the day. \n\nThe itinerary we were on was called REVERSE TRAVERSE and the collection of activities that you see are specific for that trip.  There are also other trips available such as the Ultimate Explorer which takes you around the entire country in 27 days.  Another thing to note is that while I mentioned that upgrades are available everyday, it's subject to availability and not all stops have cabin upgrade options.  \n\n\ud83d\udd34CHECK OUT FLYING KIWI \nUse the Flying Kiwi promo code \"GOINGAWESOMEPLACES\" to get a free sleeping bag rental for your entire trip.\n\u25b6 Get started:   https://goingawesomeplaces.com/flying-kiwi\n\u25b6 The Reverse Traverse itinerary we were on:  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/flying-kiwi-reverse-traverse\n\u25b6 The Ultimate Explorer:  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/flying-kiwi-ultimate-explorer\n\nAwesome people subscribe :) https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube \n\n\ud83d\udd37More NZ Trip Content\n\u25b6 Read my review of Flying Kiwi - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/flying-kiwi-new-zealand-adventure-bus-tour-review/ \n\u25b6 Super duper NZ guide - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/comprehensive-new-zealand-travel-guide/\n\u25b6 The 3 Week NZ Itinerary - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/new-zealand-itinerary-3-weeks/\n\u25b6 The Best of Flying Kiwi - https://youtu.be/kplRlublWOs\n\u25b6 Top Things to do From Queenstown - https://youtu.be/FNJSo11TxT0\n\u25b6 Skydiving in the Abel Tasman - https://youtu.be/EmOYMUBlK-k\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 WHAT GEAR DO I USE?\n\u25b6 The Do-Everything Camera - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Super Wide Lens - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 All Purpose Ridiculously Stabilized Lens - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus-12-100\n\u25b6 Super Zoom Lens - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 Drone - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/dji-mavic-pro\n\u25b6 Drone Filters - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/pgytech-mavic-pro-nd-filter\n\u25b6 Camera Shotgun Mic  -\n https://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Lav Mic  - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/tascam-dr10l\n\u25b6Primary tripod - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\u25b6 Backpack For Everything - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-travel-backpack\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - https://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\nMusic via https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Insurance: \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6http://goingawesomeplaces.com/kanetixtravelca and \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8https://goingawesomeplaces.com/allianz-travel-insurance\n\u25b6 Hotels (get $40 discount): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com \n\u25b6 Flights: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\u25b6 Airbnb (get a new account to get free $36 credit): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/airbnb-free-credit \n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces\n\n#PureNewZealand #NZMustDo #TravelNewZealand",

I give the inside scoop on what to expect and from morning to night, a walkthrough of the Flying Kiwi New Zealand experience - the best New Zealand bus tour on the market that you probably never even heard of! Open this up to learn more \u2193\n\nI totally get it - as good as the tour companies are at describing their product, it's hard to get a real sense of what it's like to be on the tour.  That's why I focused on capturing what it's like to be on a Flying Kiwi Tour behind the scenes from the beginning of the day to the end of the day. \n\nThe itinerary we were on was called REVERSE TRAVERSE and the collection of activities that you see are specific for that trip.  There are also other trips available such as the Ultimate Explorer which takes you around the entire country in 27 days.  Another thing to note is that while I mentioned that upgrades are available everyday, it's subject to availability and not all stops have cabin upgrade options.  \n\n\ud83d\udd34CHECK OUT FLYING KIWI \nUse the Flying Kiwi promo code \"GOINGAWESOMEPLACES\" to get a free sleeping bag rental for your entire trip.\n\u25b6 Get started:   https://goingawesomeplaces.com/flying-kiwi\n\u25b6 The Reverse Traverse itinerary we were on:  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/flying-kiwi-reverse-traverse\n\u25b6 The Ultimate Explorer:  https://goingawesomeplaces.com/flying-kiwi-ultimate-explorer\n\nAwesome people subscribe :) https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube \n\n\ud83d\udd37More NZ Trip Content\n\u25b6 Read my review of Flying Kiwi - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/flying-kiwi-new-zealand-adventure-bus-tour-review/ \n\u25b6 Super duper NZ guide - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/comprehensive-new-zealand-travel-guide/\n\u25b6 The 3 Week NZ Itinerary - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/new-zealand-itinerary-3-weeks/\n\u25b6 The Best of Flying Kiwi - https://youtu.be/kplRlublWOs\n\u25b6 Top Things to do From Queenstown - https://youtu.be/FNJSo11TxT0\n\u25b6 Skydiving in the Abel Tasman - https://youtu.be/EmOYMUBlK-k\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 WHAT GEAR DO I USE?\n\u25b6 The Do-Everything Camera - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Super Wide Lens - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 All Purpose Ridiculously Stabilized Lens - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus-12-100\n\u25b6 Super Zoom Lens - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 Drone - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/dji-mavic-pro\n\u25b6 Drone Filters - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/pgytech-mavic-pro-nd-filter\n\u25b6 Camera Shotgun Mic  -\n https://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Lav Mic  - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/tascam-dr10l\n\u25b6Primary tripod - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\u25b6 Backpack For Everything - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/peak-design-travel-backpack\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - https://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\nMusic via https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Insurance: \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6http://goingawesomeplaces.com/kanetixtravelca and \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8https://goingawesomeplaces.com/allianz-travel-insurance\n\u25b6 Hotels (get $40 discount): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com \n\u25b6 Flights: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\u25b6 Airbnb (get a new account to get free $36 credit): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/airbnb-free-credit \n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces\n\n#PureNewZealand #NZMustDo #TravelNewZealand"

                "channelId": "UCKCRueDLpzx1vBcQHCc4ZHA",
                "description": "It wasn't very clear to us before our trip how this Ethiopian Airlines free transit hotel business was going to work out for us from Cape Town - Addis Ababa - Seychelles so I wanted to share how it exactly works from start to end including the hotel voucher.  Open this up to learn more \u2193\n\n\u2708\ufe0fTRAVEL HACKING\nIf you're travelling through Africa, Ethiopian Airlines is a very good option especially if you're with Star Alliance and using your points.  Often times, you'll run into issues with making connecting flights through Addis Ababa.  In our case, we arrived in Addis really late from Cape Town and to connect with our flight to Seychelles meant we had to stay overnight.  Luckily, Ethiopian Airlines offers a complimentary transit hotel if your layover is 8 to 24 hours and between two Ethiopian Airlines international flights..  \n\n\ud83d\udd34The rules:\n- You must be connecting through to an international flight on Ethiopian Airlines\n- The long layover overnight must be the result of not having a choice for anything else (as in there are no options to fly out on the same day)\n- Your passport must be eligible for a transit visa on arrival (most passports seem to be fine although there's no official list)\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Here's what you need to know that nobody tells you about:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 You CANNOT remove your bags during the transit so pack accordingly.  This was not made clear in other guides I've read.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3You do not need to go to the transfer office when you land.  Head straight out and go to the hotel transfer desk that is right outside the luggage hall in the arrivals area.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3Overnight in Ethiopia means that another country you fly to may immediately ask for Yellow Fever documentation.  It is recommended that you have this ready.\n\nEnjoyed this vlog?

                    "description": "It wasn't very clear to us before our trip how this Ethiopian Airlines free transit hotel business was going to work out for us from Cape Town - Addis Ababa - Seychelles so I wanted to share how it exactly works from start to end including the hotel voucher.  Open this up to learn more \u2193\n\n\u2708\ufe0fTRAVEL HACKING\nIf you're travelling through Africa, Ethiopian Airlines is a very good option especially if you're with Star Alliance and using your points.  Often times, you'll run into issues with making connecting flights through Addis Ababa.  In our case, we arrived in Addis really late from Cape Town and to connect with our flight to Seychelles meant we had to stay overnight.  Luckily, Ethiopian Airlines offers a complimentary transit hotel if your layover is 8 to 24 hours and between two Ethiopian Airlines international flights..  \n\n\ud83d\udd34The rules:\n- You must be connecting through to an international flight on Ethiopian Airlines\n- The long layover overnight must be the result of not having a choice for anything else (as in there are no options to fly out on the same day)\n- Your passport must be eligible for a transit visa on arrival (most passports seem to be fine although there's no official list)\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Here's what you need to know that nobody tells you about:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 You CANNOT remove your bags during the transit so pack accordingly.  This was not made clear in other guides I've read.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3You do not need to go to the transfer office when you land.  Head straight out and go to the hotel transfer desk that is right outside the luggage hall in the arrivals area.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3Overnight in Ethiopia means that another country you fly to may immediately ask for Yellow Fever documentation.  It is recommended that you have this ready.\n\nEnjoyed this vlog?

Well designed and like I say in the video \"it just works\".  \n\nDon't worry, I'll be doing the packing of this into the 45L real soon so make sure you're subscribed at https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube \n\n\ud83d\udcb2PRICING\nPacking Cubes - $24 Kickstarter; MSRP $30\n\n\u2049\ufe0f HAVE QUESTIONS?\nThis is probably the most important of all - ASK your questions down below so I know what to focus on in my upcoming videos!\n\n\ud83d\udd04 GEAR FEATURED \nHere's some of the gear that's featured in this vid:\n\u25b6  F-stop Loka (discontinued but replaced with Loka UL - https://fstopgear.com/products/packs/loka-ul\n\u25b6  F-stop rain cover  - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/fstop-large-raincover\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f MAP FEATURED IN THE VIDEO - I discovered this while travelling Europe but you can buy it online as well - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/palomar-pin-world\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 WHAT GEAR DO I USE?\n\u25b6 The Do-Everything Camera - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Super Wide Lens - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 All Purpose Lens - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Super Zoom Lens - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 Camera Mic  -\n https://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6Primary tripod - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - http://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\nMusic via epidemicsound.com\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Insurance: \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6http://goingawesomeplaces.com/kanetixtravelca and \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8https://goingawesomeplaces.com/allianz-travel-insurance\n\u25b6 Hotels (get $40 discount): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com \n\u25b6 Flights: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\u25b6 Airbnb (get a new account to get free $36 credit): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/airbnb-free-credit \n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces\n\n#peakdesign #findyourpeak #travelgear"

We booked with the Tokyo Bay BBQ franchise specifically which leaves out of Koto district and their 2.5 to 3 hour drive called the K-L course around Rainbow Bridge, Tokyo Tower, Tokyo Gate Bridge, and Shibuya Crossing.\n\nThis video follows our entire experience from start to end where we dress up as our favourite Dragonball, Mario, Nintendo, Marvel, or Disney characters and drive through the streets of Tokyo on go karts. It's a crazy experience that is nuts that it's even legal but we had one heck of a time.\n\nMake sure you get your international drivers license ahead of time at home.  The total cost for our trip was 12,000 JPY or roughly $108 USD.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 I purchased a multi-trip travel insurance policy before we left for our honeymoon and it was so easy with Kanetix.ca (Now RATESDOTCA).  Just punch in \u2328\ufe0f  my requirements and bam \ud83d\udca5 it was there \ud83e\udd2f.

                    "description": "It's been a dream of mine to do the Mario Kart experience in Tokyo and on our latest trip, we made it happen.  We booked with the Tokyo Bay BBQ franchise specifically which leaves out of Koto district and their 2.5 to 3 hour drive called the K-L course around Rainbow Bridge, Tokyo Tower, Tokyo Gate Bridge, and Shibuya Crossing.\n\nThis video follows our entire experience from start to end where we dress up as our favourite Dragonball, Mario, Nintendo, Marvel, or Disney characters and drive through the streets of Tokyo on go karts. It's a crazy experience that is nuts that it's even legal but we had one heck of a time.\n\nMake sure you get your international drivers license ahead of time at home.  The total cost for our trip was 12,000 JPY or roughly $108 USD.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 I purchased a multi-trip travel insurance policy before we left for our honeymoon and it was so easy with Kanetix.ca (Now RATESDOTCA).  Just punch in \u2328\ufe0f  my requirements and bam \ud83d\udca5 it was there \ud83e\udd2f.  It was that easy.\n\n\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6Give RATESDOTCA a try here  \u27a1\ufe0f http://goingawesomeplaces.com/ratesdotca\n\nFound this video helpful?

Unbeknownst to us, a film crew was following us all the way through, quietly documenting all of the craziness of travelling to mystery destinations, wild challenges, and red herrings.  2+ years later, the production team of Laura Watilo Blake, Robert (Bob) Reiland, and Fran Belkin put together a documentary that follows our adventures and tells a story of the mastermind of Steve Belkin and the bonds that are created throughout the trip.\n\nWhile you'll have to wait a little longer for the movie to come out *crossing our fingers*, this gives you a look into what it was like to be at the world premiere of Tripped Up at the 42nd Cleveland International Film Festival as 7 of the 9 teams reunited for the first time as a group and watched a really good documentary that not only documents our whole trip but provides a sense of what it's like to be on Competitours, the drama along the way, and the bonds that were created that trumped the prize money.\n\nMORE ABOUT THE MOVIE:  http://trippedupmovie.com/\n\nAnd hey, I got an film credit from this as part of the cast and camera operator as a chunk of the movie is from my YouTube series.\n\nMY NEW IMDB PAGE:  http://imdb.me/williamtang\n\nLove this video and want more?

                    "description": "In 2015, Sam and Will joined forces to create Team Awesome Duo for The Amazing Race-like trip called Competitours for a European vacation of a lifetime.  Unbeknownst to us, a film crew was following us all the way through, quietly documenting all of the craziness of travelling to mystery destinations, wild challenges, and red herrings.  2+ years later, the production team of Laura Watilo Blake, Robert (Bob) Reiland, and Fran Belkin put together a documentary that follows our adventures and tells a story of the mastermind of Steve Belkin and the bonds that are created throughout the trip.\n\nWhile you'll have to wait a little longer for the movie to come out *crossing our fingers*, this gives you a look into what it was like to be at the world premiere of Tripped Up at the 42nd Cleveland International Film Festival as 7 of the 9 teams reunited for the first time as a group and watched a really good documentary that not only documents our whole trip but provides a sense of what it's like to be on Competitours, the drama along the way, and the bonds that were created that trumped the prize money.\n\nMORE ABOUT THE MOVIE:  http://trippedupmovie.com/\n\nAnd hey, I got an film credit from this as part of the cast and camera operator as a chunk of the movie is from my YouTube series.\n\nMY NEW IMDB PAGE:  http://imdb.me/williamtang\n\nLove this video and want more?

Top 3 sightings have to be: 1) Baby elephant, 2) Hippo with all the turtles on back, and 3) Herd of water buffaloes crossing the road.\n\nKruger was also SCARY because of the lone huge cockroach that we saw in our first bungalow we stayed at in Skukuza.  In the video you'll see me recount the story of the night we checked in.  We unfortunately weren't able to catch it but resorted to using one of the towels to stuff the bottom of the bathroom door as that was the last place we saw it.  \n\nI think one thing we kept asking ourselves while we were there was which experience we liked better.  The conclusion we came to was that doing self-drive is a VERY DIFFERENT experience.  While we loved how we were pampered at Elephant Plains and that they could go off-road to see the animals really up close, there was a bit more sense of adventure with Kruger because you were in control of what route you wanted to take everytime you went out.  Kruger being a massive park, there are definitely a lot more wildlife to spot and the type of terrain and landscapes very much over Sabi Sands which was more or less the same throughout.  Doing self-drive is also going to save you a lot more money over a private reserve even though Elephant Plains was quite affordable when comparing to others.  The issue with Kruger though is that you're not going to have the benefit of having a tracker to spot animals so a lot of times I felt like we would drive for hours and unless the animal was near the side of the road or if we saw a cluster of cars, it was very hard to spot anything far away.  \n\nLastly I think it'd be valuable to talk about the game drives offered by Kruger.  While it was nice to be on a guided trip while we were there, the experience was definitely subpar compared to the private reserve.  Instead of a truck of 9, we were on these massive trucks of 20+.  What was annoying about these trips is how frenzied it was when it came time to boarding the truck.  It's pretty much first come first serve so everyone swarms the trucks when its time to board the trucks because it sucks to be stuck in the back row sandwiched by other people.  Yes the vantage point is better but the rush for seats and the poorer quality guides/tracker was very apparently especially coming from a private game reserve.  \n\nLove this video and want more?

I have to thank Joshua of MyTaiwanTour for this episode and introducing us to his tai chi class, and showing us Wulai.\n\n\ud83d\udd34PLACES FEATURED\n - Tai chi at Muzha Zhongshun Temple 1:14\n - Wulai 3:27\n - Yen Town hot springs 4:16\n - Tribal lunch in Wulai 6:02\n - Wulai temple 6:31\n - Bitan and Rainbow popsicle shop 6:42\n - Gogoro electric scooters 7:06\n - Addiction Aquatic Development 7:43\n - Shrimp Fishing in Zhongshan district 8:12\n - Din Tai Fung 11:30\n - Chia Te 13:10\n - GIVEAWAY ALERT 13:50\n - SunnyHills  14:23\n - Ice Galaxy 14:40\n - WESTGATE Hotel 14:49\n - 7-Eleven 14:57\n - Taoyuan International Airport 16:11\n\nThe travelogue, 12 Days in Taiwan, follows the adventures of Will from Going Awesome Places as he and his wife travel all around the country of Taiwan in search of adventure, culinary delights, ways to live like a local, and get a better understanding of Taiwanese culture.\n\n\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc EPISODES IN THE SERIES\nEpisode 1: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep1\nEpisode 2: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep2\nEpisode 3: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep3\nEpisode 4: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep4\nEpisode 5: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep5\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Special thanks to Taiwan Tourism Bureau for making this trip happen!\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Want to know every single place we visited?:  http://goingawesomeplaces.com/12-days-taiwan-travel-guide-itinerary-explore-entire-island/\n\n\ud83d\udca1 As if you needed more reasons to go to Taiwan:  http://goingawesomeplaces.com/why-you-need-to-travel-to-taiwan-next/\n\n\ud83c\udfe8WHERE WE STAYED\n- Westgate Hotel in Taipei - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/westgate-hotel-taipei\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 GEAR USED\n\u25b6 Camera - Olympus OMD EM1 MK2 - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 7-14mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 12-40mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 40-150mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 Microphone - Rode VideoMic  -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Tripod - Joby Gorillapod Hybrid -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/jobygorillapodhybrid\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - https://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\nMusic via https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Hotels: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com \n\u25b6 Flights: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\u25b6 Airbnb (get a new account to get free $36 USD credit): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/airbnb-free-credit \n\u25b6 Insurance: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/kanetixtravelca\n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces"

                "description": "Episode 3 features highs of paragliding and soaring the skies of Taitung with a wedgie and also the lows of being pounded by waves in Kenting while attempting to surf and ALMOST dying (or at least being seriously injured) but regardless of it all we never lost our sense of adventure and we still filled our tummies with delicious food.\n\nHeading south to Kenting and Taitung, there was one mission in mind and that was to explore by doing and in some ways we got more than we bargained for.  We combined our stay at Afei's hotel/inn/hostel with delicious meals there and also his personally run surfing trips. While we were brimming with confidence since South Africa, we totally weren't prepared for how hard it was out there with the big waves and challenging conditions.  We both came out with injuries.  Wanting to do something a little bit more laid back, we eventually got scooters, although that was a mission on its own.  In Taitung, we got to realize our dreams of paragliding although even that was very last minute.  On our very last day in the city, we borrowed bikes from our hotel and roamed through the city and as usual, managed to find great food places along the way.  \n\nTaiwanese \"re qing\" was on display again in this travelogue with Sean whom we met at paragliding.

We combined our stay at Afei's hotel/inn/hostel with delicious meals there and also his personally run surfing trips. While we were brimming with confidence since South Africa, we totally weren't prepared for how hard it was out there with the big waves and challenging conditions.  We both came out with injuries.  Wanting to do something a little bit more laid back, we eventually got scooters, although that was a mission on its own.  In Taitung, we got to realize our dreams of paragliding although even that was very last minute.  On our very last day in the city, we borrowed bikes from our hotel and roamed through the city and as usual, managed to find great food places along the way.  \n\nTaiwanese \"re qing\" was on display again in this travelogue with Sean whom we met at paragliding.  He totally didn't have to but he helped us find a cheaper way back home.  We also ended up having dinner together at the train station as we waited.  His story is actually quite amazing on its own as he was partway through his hike around the entire country with nothing more than his backpack.

Just when I thought I had bought the right card for my wife, turns out it wasn't an EasyCard at all.  icash2.0 didn't work on the bus we were taking up to Alishan and we learned the hard way.  Once up in Alishan, we woke up ridiculously early for the sunrise and while it looked like it was going to happen, that ended up being a fail as well.  Still, we had a great time hiking through the forest the reminded me a lot of Lord of the Rings (Entwood or Mirkwood, take your pick).  When we finally made it to Kaohsiung, we were pleasantly surprised by a city that is much less hectic and crowded than Taipei.  This allowed us to freely explore places like the Dragon and Tiger Pagodas, and the super artsy Pier-2.\n\nMake sure to subscribe if you haven't yet! https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube  \n\nPLACES FEATURED\n - Chiayi THSR Station 2:01\n - Fenqihu 3:21\n - Fenqihu Bento Box 3:58\n - Alishan Forest Recreation Area 4:55\n - Alishan House 6:43\n - Alishan House Observation Deck 6:49\n - Alishan House Room Walkthrough 7:05\n - Hiking Alishan 9:28\n - Hoya Resort Hotel 11:04\n - Dragon and Tiger Pagodas 11:54\n - Kaohsiung Pier-2 Art Center 12:33\n - SunnyHills 13:00\n - Gang Yuan Beef Noodles 13:11\n - Buono Pops 13:43\n - Dome of Light 14:03\n\nThe travelogue, 12 Days in Taiwan, follows the adventures of Will from Going Awesome Places as he and his wife travel all around the country of Taiwan in search of adventure, culinary delights, ways to live like a local, and get a better understanding of Taiwanese culture.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 EPISODES IN THE SERIES\nEpisode 1: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep1\nEpisode 2: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep2\nEpisode 3: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep3\nEpisode 4: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep4\nEpisode 5: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep5\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Special thanks to Taiwan Tourism Bureau for making this trip happen!\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Want to know every single place we visited?:  http://goingawesomeplaces.com/12-days-taiwan-travel-guide-itinerary-explore-entire-island/\n\n\ud83d\udd35 ULTIMATE GUIDE TO ALISHAN: https://goingawesomeplaces.com/ultimate-guide-alishan-national-recreational-forest-famous-sunrise/  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 As if you needed more reasons to go to Taiwan:  http://goingawesomeplaces.com/why-you-need-to-travel-to-taiwan-next/\n\n\ud83c\udfe8WHERE WE STAYED\n- Alishan House - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/alishan-house-hotel\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 GEAR USED\n\u25b6 Camera - Olympus OMD EM1 MK2 - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 7-14mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 12-40mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 40-150mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 Microphone - Rode VideoMic  -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Tripod - Joby Gorillapod Hybrid -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/jobygorillapodhybrid\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - https://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\nMusic via https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Hotels: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com \n\u25b6 Flights: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\u25b6 Airbnb (sign up to get free $36 credit): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/airbnb-free-credit \n\u25b6 Insurance: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/kanetixtravelca\n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces",

                    "description": "In this second episode, we hit the road and leave Taipei for the famous forests and mountains of Alishan before heading over to Taiwan's second largest city, Kaohsiung.  \n\nYou never know what's going to happen when you're on the road and these few days are no exception.  Just when I thought I had bought the right card for my wife, turns out it wasn't an EasyCard at all.  icash2.0 didn't work on the bus we were taking up to Alishan and we learned the hard way.  Once up in Alishan, we woke up ridiculously early for the sunrise and while it looked like it was going to happen, that ended up being a fail as well.  Still, we had a great time hiking through the forest the reminded me a lot of Lord of the Rings (Entwood or Mirkwood, take your pick).  When we finally made it to Kaohsiung, we were pleasantly surprised by a city that is much less hectic and crowded than Taipei.  This allowed us to freely explore places like the Dragon and Tiger Pagodas, and the super artsy Pier-2.\n\nMake sure to subscribe if you haven't yet! https://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube  \n\nPLACES FEATURED\n - Chiayi THSR Station 2:01\n - Fenqihu 3:21\n - Fenqihu Bento Box 3:58\n - Alishan Forest Recreation Area 4:55\n - Alishan House 6:43\n - Alishan House Observation Deck 6:49\n - Alishan House Room Walkthrough 7:05\n - Hiking Alishan 9:28\n - Hoya Resort Hotel 11:04\n - Dragon and Tiger Pagodas 11:54\n - Kaohsiung Pier-2 Art Center 12:33\n - SunnyHills 13:00\n - Gang Yuan Beef Noodles 13:11\n - Buono Pops 13:43\n - Dome of Light 14:03\n\nThe travelogue, 12 Days in Taiwan, follows the adventures of Will from Going Awesome Places as he and his wife travel all around the country of Taiwan in search of adventure, culinary delights, ways to live like a local, and get a better understanding of Taiwanese culture.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 EPISODES IN THE SERIES\nEpisode 1: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep1\nEpisode 2: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep2\nEpisode 3: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep3\nEpisode 4: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep4\nEpisode 5: https://goaw.pl/taiwan_ep5\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Special thanks to Taiwan Tourism Bureau for making this trip happen!\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Want to know every single place we visited?:  http://goingawesomeplaces.com/12-days-taiwan-travel-guide-itinerary-explore-entire-island/\n\n\ud83d\udd35 ULTIMATE GUIDE TO ALISHAN: https://goingawesomeplaces.com/ultimate-guide-alishan-national-recreational-forest-famous-sunrise/  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 As if you needed more reasons to go to Taiwan:  http://goingawesomeplaces.com/why-you-need-to-travel-to-taiwan-next/\n\n\ud83c\udfe8WHERE WE STAYED\n- Alishan House - https://goingawesomeplaces.com/alishan-house-hotel\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 GEAR USED\n\u25b6 Camera - Olympus OMD EM1 MK2 - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 7-14mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 12-40mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 40-150mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\u25b6 Microphone - Rode VideoMic  -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Tripod - Joby Gorillapod Hybrid -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/jobygorillapodhybrid\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - https://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\nMusic via https://goingawesomeplaces.com/epidemic-sound\n\n\ud83d\udeeb TRAVEL MORE\n\u25b6 Hotels: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/booking-com \n\u25b6 Flights: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/skyscanner\n\u25b6 Airbnb (sign up to get free $36 credit): http://goingawesomeplaces.com/airbnb-free-credit \n\u25b6 Insurance: http://goingawesomeplaces.com/kanetixtravelca\n\n\ud83e\udd18 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  https://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  https://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces"

                "description": "This is my complete and detailed review of the brand new Zolo Liberty+ (Liberty Plus) earphones that I purchased through their Kickstarter campaign.  As the first batch of users of these \"total wireless earbuds\", I've put together my personal thoughts on everything from the packaging through the unboxing, pairing, audio quality, functionality, physical design, fitment, battery life, and app.  There's a lot to delve into in this full review!\n\nZolo is a subsidiary company to Anker which is known for their mobile tech gadgets like power banks.  This is their first jump into serious audio gear and I like where they're headed towards and while I have been pretty impressed with these wireless earbuds, the final verdict as you'll see in the video is that it still needs a bit of polishing to truly delight.  It was just announced that they're rebranding to Soundcore so really these will be eventually called Soundcore Liberty Plus.\n\nWhat I've Loved About Them:\n- Sound is pretty damn good for what they are.  I think the only gripes I've had with them are songs with a lot of treble and high notes where they've sounded a bit flat.  Otherwise, pretty impressed.\n- Battery life is really good TBH.  \n- Simple pairing process and easy to connect once out of the case.  Single tap initiates BT connection and the iPhone picks it up really fast\n- BT 5.0 - amazing range, and potential for multi-connectivity in the future I believe\n\nWhat Needs Improving:\n- The audio does cut out, particularly the left side.  It's random but usually involves long periods of listening.  The shortest period was maybe 30 minutes.  It'll cut but re-establish connection within a few seconds so it is tolerable\n- I really wish there was a way to mod the charging case to allow for different tips.  Because my right ear uses the custom Sony ones, they stick out more and thus don't make good contact in the case.  Sometimes it'll lift out of the charging contacts while in my bag and turn on which inadvertently connects with my phone\n- I\u2019ve noticed that it has trouble with extreme highs  where it seems to clip off a bit. (Figured it out!  Shake to get the LEDs to light up)\n- Charging case LEDs are still a bit of a mystery to me.  Sometimes they come on and sometimes they don't.  \n- The app needs to look at what Jaybird has done and do what they did.  Custom EQ's please!!!\n- Call audio outputs from the right ear only.  \n\nKeep the comments coming in!

Easy to find after popping up from subway, I make my way down to the remains of a warehouse dock and set up my gear to do an impromptu walkthrough to long exposure photography and how you can get that silky smooth water.  It wasn't the best sunset because of the storm that passed through but it provides the tips you're going to need to know to perfect this photography technique.\n\nIf you're WILLing, you would be my new favourite person in the world subscribe to get more of WILL from Going Awesome Places \ud83d\ude0a http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\n\ud83d\uddfd\u25b6 FIRST TIME UBER-ING?\n\u25b6 Get $10 off - Just use code willt1234ue\n\n\ud83d\udcf8\u25b6 GEAR USED\n\u25b6 Camera - Olympus OMD EM1 MK2 - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 7-14mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 Filter Holder - Formatt Hitech - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 Filter Holder - Formatt Hitech 100mm - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/formatt-hitech-holder\n\u25b6 ND3.0 Glass - Formatt Hitech Firecrest ND3.0 -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/formatt-hitech-firecrest-nd3\n\u25b6 Gimbal Camera - DJI Osmo+  - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/djiosmoplus\n\u25b6 Tripod - Joby Gorillapod Hybrid -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/jobygorillapodhybrid\n\u25b6 Microphone - Rode VideoMic  -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Lav - Rode smartLav+ for Smartphones  -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodesmartlav\n\u25b6 Tripod - Sirui T-024X Traveler Light Carbon Fiber Tripod -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\u25b6 Backpack - PeakDesign Everyday Backpack 30L (the bag that carries ALL of my stuff) - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/everydaybackpack30l\n\n\ud83d\udd06\u25b6 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - http://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\nMusic by Utah - On The Mountain By The Sea\n\n\ud83e\udd18\u25b6 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  http://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  http://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  http://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces"

                    "description": "Over 5 years ago, I made a decision to switch away from my Canon full frame gear for my travel photography to Olympus Micro Four Thirds, a type of mirrorless technology.  The transition was incredibly easy and my shoulders and back definitely thanked me for it.  No longer did I have to carry excessive pounds of gear.  I shed half the weight and I was able to take just as epic photos while I am on the road.  I babble on for a bit about my journey from DSLR to mirrorless and present my points for why you should as well.\n\nIf you're WILLing, you would be my new favourite person in the world subscribe to get more of WILL from Going Awesome Places :) http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\n\ud83d\udcf8\u25b6 GEAR USED\nOLYMPUS\n\u25b6 Camera - Olympus OMD EM1 MK2 - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 12-40mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus12-40\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 7-14mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus7-14\n\u25b6 Lens - Olympus M.ZUIKO 40-150mm f2.8 PRO - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/olympus40-150\n\nCANON\n\u25b6 Camera - Canon 5D Mark 3 - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/canon5dmk3\n\u25b6 Lens - Canon 24-70mm f/2.8L II  - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/canon24-70ii\n\u25b6 Lens - Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L II - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/canon16-35ii\n\u25b6 Lens - Canon 70-200 IS f2.8 I  - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/canon70-200i\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE\n\u25b6 Gimbal Camera - DJI Osmo+  - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/djiosmoplus\n\u25b6 Microphone - Rode VideoMic  -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodevideomic\n\u25b6 Lav - Rode smartLav+ for Smartphones  -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/rodesmartlav\n\u25b6 Tripod - Sirui T-024X Traveler Light Carbon Fiber Tripod -\n http://goingawesomeplaces.com/siruit024x\n\n\ud83d\udd06\u25b6 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - http://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\nMusic by Utah - On The Mountain By The Sea\n\n\ud83e\udd18\u25b6 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  http://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  http://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  http://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces"

                "description": "As I make my way from Toronto to New York's LaGuardia, I test out for the very first time an Uber hack at the airport.  I had heard about it from an insider I know at Uber but had never done it.  See how I was able to get a ride from LGA to Midtown Manhattan for only $24.50 and also not have to pick up anyone along the way as part of Uber Pool.  CRAZY!!  Great way to start a trip :)\n\n\u25b6\u25b6 How To Pay For LESS  When Taking An Uber From An Airport \u25c0\u25c0\n\u25aa Step 1:  If you have no wifi, make sure you get on it at the airport.  LGA has Boingo (boo Boingo) but they have a complimentary 30 minute pass so take advantage.\n\u25aa Step 2:  Use Uber and set your destination.  The key now though is to set a pick up point that is just outside the airport.  \n\u25aa Step 3:  Do a comparison of the prices between pick up right at the terminal or on a local street/hotel outside the airport.  If Uber Pool or Uber X is cheaper outside the airport, book it!\n\u25aa Step 4:  Once you've been paired with a driver, call that driver right away.  Let him/her know that you are actually at the airport and to come grab you at the terminal.  You might have to negotiate where to pick you up depending on how strict the rules are at the airport.  The driver will typically oblige.\n\u25aa Step 5:  Get whisked away to your destination and laugh at how much money you've saved!\n\nNow that's what I call travelling smart :)\n\nIf you're WILLing, you would be my new favourite person in the world subscribe to get more of WILL from Going Awesome Places :) http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\n\ud83d\ude96 FIRST TIME UBER-ER?\n\u25b6 Get $10 - Go to http://goingawesomeplaces.com/uber and use the code willt1234ue\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 GEAR USED\n\u25b6 Camera - Olympus OMD EM1 MK2 - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Tripod - Sirui T-024X Traveler Light Carbon Fiber Tripod (only 15.7\" (40cm) when folded) -\n http://amzn.to/2jOVeZq\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - http://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\n\n\ud83e\udd18\u25b6 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  http://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  http://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  http://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces",

                    "description": "As I make my way from Toronto to New York's LaGuardia, I test out for the very first time an Uber hack at the airport.  I had heard about it from an insider I know at Uber but had never done it.  See how I was able to get a ride from LGA to Midtown Manhattan for only $24.50 and also not have to pick up anyone along the way as part of Uber Pool.  CRAZY!!  Great way to start a trip :)\n\n\u25b6\u25b6 How To Pay For LESS  When Taking An Uber From An Airport \u25c0\u25c0\n\u25aa Step 1:  If you have no wifi, make sure you get on it at the airport.  LGA has Boingo (boo Boingo) but they have a complimentary 30 minute pass so take advantage.\n\u25aa Step 2:  Use Uber and set your destination.  The key now though is to set a pick up point that is just outside the airport.  \n\u25aa Step 3:  Do a comparison of the prices between pick up right at the terminal or on a local street/hotel outside the airport.  If Uber Pool or Uber X is cheaper outside the airport, book it!\n\u25aa Step 4:  Once you've been paired with a driver, call that driver right away.  Let him/her know that you are actually at the airport and to come grab you at the terminal.  You might have to negotiate where to pick you up depending on how strict the rules are at the airport.  The driver will typically oblige.\n\u25aa Step 5:  Get whisked away to your destination and laugh at how much money you've saved!\n\nNow that's what I call travelling smart :)\n\nIf you're WILLing, you would be my new favourite person in the world subscribe to get more of WILL from Going Awesome Places :) http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\n\ud83d\ude96 FIRST TIME UBER-ER?\n\u25b6 Get $10 - Go to http://goingawesomeplaces.com/uber and use the code willt1234ue\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 GEAR USED\n\u25b6 Camera - Olympus OMD EM1 MK2 - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Tripod - Sirui T-024X Traveler Light Carbon Fiber Tripod (only 15.7\" (40cm) when folded) -\n http://amzn.to/2jOVeZq\n\n\ud83d\udd06 LOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 BLOG - http://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\n\n\ud83e\udd18\u25b6 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  http://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  http://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  http://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces"

                "description": "This is my full product review of Pistol Lake's Eudae Minimalist Performance Henley and Sweat Shorts.  I've been wearing their clothes for the past couple of months and I have to say that I am pretty impressed.  As travel gear, these are lightweight, moisture wicking, quick drying, incredibly soft to touch, easy to wash, and damn good looking.  There's something about their fabric that makes them really unique.  It's hard to describe even in the video but it is REALLY COMFY.  I love how it's not really branded either so it's the type of versatile clothing that you can wear with you every day for a dress-down set up or even in a more dress-up scenario when you pair it with a nicer pair of pants.  When it comes to travel clothing, it's versatility like this, comfort, and ease of wash which makes it a top choice when it comes to what is packed in your bag.  \n\nPistol Lake is a men's fashion focused on the ultra-functional minimalist with their special Eudae fabric which is made up of eucalyptus root and recycled bottles.  All of their clothing is made right in California too!\n\nSHOP THIS LOOK\n\u25b6 Minimalist Performance Henley (Navy) - https://www.pistollake.com/collections/everything/products/eudae-minimalist-performance-tee?variant=31540754309\n\u25b6 Sweat Shorts (Burgundy) - https://www.pistollake.com/products/french-terry-sweatshort?variant=3830203141\n\nGEAR USED\n\u25b6 Camera - Olympus OMD EM1 MK2 (no gimbal!) - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Tripod - Sirui T-024X Traveler Light Carbon Fiber Tripod (only 15.7\" (40cm) when folded) -\n http://amzn.to/2jOVeZq\n\nLOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 REVIEW ARTICLE - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/review-pistol-lake-eudae-minimalist-performance-henley-sweat-shorts/\n\u25b6 BLOG - http://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\n\n\u25b6 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  http://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  http://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  http://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces",

                    "description": "This is my full product review of Pistol Lake's Eudae Minimalist Performance Henley and Sweat Shorts.  I've been wearing their clothes for the past couple of months and I have to say that I am pretty impressed.  As travel gear, these are lightweight, moisture wicking, quick drying, incredibly soft to touch, easy to wash, and damn good looking.  There's something about their fabric that makes them really unique.  It's hard to describe even in the video but it is REALLY COMFY.  I love how it's not really branded either so it's the type of versatile clothing that you can wear with you every day for a dress-down set up or even in a more dress-up scenario when you pair it with a nicer pair of pants.  When it comes to travel clothing, it's versatility like this, comfort, and ease of wash which makes it a top choice when it comes to what is packed in your bag.  \n\nPistol Lake is a men's fashion focused on the ultra-functional minimalist with their special Eudae fabric which is made up of eucalyptus root and recycled bottles.  All of their clothing is made right in California too!\n\nSHOP THIS LOOK\n\u25b6 Minimalist Performance Henley (Navy) - https://www.pistollake.com/collections/everything/products/eudae-minimalist-performance-tee?variant=31540754309\n\u25b6 Sweat Shorts (Burgundy) - https://www.pistollake.com/products/french-terry-sweatshort?variant=3830203141\n\nGEAR USED\n\u25b6 Camera - Olympus OMD EM1 MK2 (no gimbal!) - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/omdem1mk2\n\u25b6 Tripod - Sirui T-024X Traveler Light Carbon Fiber Tripod (only 15.7\" (40cm) when folded) -\n http://amzn.to/2jOVeZq\n\nLOOKING FOR MORE?\n\u25b6 REVIEW ARTICLE - http://goingawesomeplaces.com/review-pistol-lake-eudae-minimalist-performance-henley-sweat-shorts/\n\u25b6 BLOG - http://goingawesomeplaces.com\n\u25b6 SUBSCRIBE - http://goaw.pl/AwesomeTube\n\nProduced, filmed & edited by Will Tang\n\n\u25b6 LET'S CONNECT!\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/goingawesomeplaces\nTwitter:  http://twitter.com/goawesomeplaces\nPinterest:  http://pinterest.com/goawesomeplaces\nFacebook:  http://facebook.com/goingawesomeplaces"

I'm friggin stoked because I'm coming from an iPhone 5S and 16GB just isn't enough.
