I was deeply conflicted about the whole affair up until a month before conception. Prior to that, I have done a bunch of research online, reached out to parents and asked for their honest opinion, listened to my inner wisdom and faced my struggles with honesty and kindness.\n\nIt often seems like there are two kinds of people in this world \u2013 those who just know they want to be parents, and those who are strong in their conviction that they do not.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of middle ground, a land of \u2018I\u2019m not sure\u2018 that I suspect most of us fall into. I definitely was one of them.

This is known as Fakarava's wall of sharks, and it's some of the best diving I've ever seen. \n\nBut we did all this to build up to the big thing - swimming with A TIGER SHARK. This apex predator is one of the types that regularly attacks humans, but I'm wondering, do we have them all wrong? Do we misunderstand? We aim to get close and personal to find out. \n\nWATCH the other videos in this French Polynesia series: \nThe Most Beautiful Island in the World: https://youtu.be/5REagGqsUeM\nOff Grid on a Remote Island: https://youtu.be/lEcuKmrZ_4A\nAccidentally Hitchhiking on Huahine: https://youtu.be/2VmnqqjBLXk\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\u200b\u200b\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse",

                    "description": "It's my version of shark week in French Polynesia, beginning in Fakarava and ending in Tikehau, two islands in the Tuamotus that are teeming with sharks (and other awesome sealife). \n\nFakarava is a remote coral atoll, and it's home to some beautiful beaches and lovely people, plus SHARKS. \n\nFirst, I'm diving with hundreds of reef sharks, some of which we're doing at night in the pitch black. This is known as Fakarava's wall of sharks, and it's some of the best diving I've ever seen. \n\nBut we did all this to build up to the big thing - swimming with A TIGER SHARK. This apex predator is one of the types that regularly attacks humans, but I'm wondering, do we have them all wrong? Do we misunderstand? We aim to get close and personal to find out. \n\nWATCH the other videos in this French Polynesia series: \nThe Most Beautiful Island in the World: https://youtu.be/5REagGqsUeM\nOff Grid on a Remote Island: https://youtu.be/lEcuKmrZ_4A\nAccidentally Hitchhiking on Huahine: https://youtu.be/2VmnqqjBLXk\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\u200b\u200b\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse"

Here they live off the grid, mostly living off the land foraging, growing their own food, and hunting for what they eat. This is true farm to table! This is a unique opportunity to see what it's like to live off the land, to be in harmony with the environment, and to get a peek into Marquesan culture. \n\nI'm joining Ana and Tangy of Cannibal art for this adventure.

                    "description": "This is the Hakaui Valley on the remote island of Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas, French Polynesia. \n\nWith the nearest continental mass over 3000 miles away, this is one of the most remote islands on earth, and the Hakaui valley cannot be reached by road, plane, or anything other than a boat or a 17km hike from the nearest town of Taiohae. \n\nThe island itself is a full 3 hour flight from the capitol of Tahiti! \n\nFor this adventure, I'm seeing if I can survive for 24 hours in this jungle without electricity (other than minimal solar light), refrigeration, communication with the outside world, and the basic comforts we take for granted. Here they live off the grid, mostly living off the land foraging, growing their own food, and hunting for what they eat. This is true farm to table! This is a unique opportunity to see what it's like to live off the land, to be in harmony with the environment, and to get a peek into Marquesan culture. \n\nI'm joining Ana and Tangy of Cannibal art for this adventure.

There's a lot to do there even if you don't see the lights, including hot springs, an ice sculpture festival, ice caves, and more. ICYMI, you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPSZIPhRaz8\n\nDenali National Park in Alaska is super crowded in the summer, but is it worth visiting in the winter? FYI, by late February, the park road is plowed further in, to mile 12.5.  This gives you a chance to see the snow-covered mountains, and maybe if you're lucky, watch the aurora borealis, aka northern lights, over Denali. \n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for adventures around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\nWHERE DID WE STAY?

There's a lot to do there even if you don't see the lights, including hot springs, an ice sculpture festival, ice caves, and more. ICYMI, you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPSZIPhRaz8\n\nDenali National Park in Alaska is super crowded in the summer, but is it worth visiting in the winter? FYI, by late February, the park road is plowed further in, to mile 12.5.  This gives you a chance to see the snow-covered mountains, and maybe if you're lucky, watch the aurora borealis, aka northern lights, over Denali. \n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for adventures around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\nWHERE DID WE STAY?

                "description": "TOP 10 CANADIAN THINGS TO DO IN THE WINTER\n\nTalk about a real winter experience in Manitoba, Canada! Growing up in California, snowy winter has always been a foreign concept to me. For my recent partnership with Travel Manitoba, I was given the opportunity to spend a few days exploring Manitoba, and trying out various winter activities that are fun and unique. Here are my top 10 favourite things to do in the winter:\n\n1.  Winter walks in Whiteshell Provincial Park\n\nI got to walk on a frozen lake! The ice is so thick, you can skate, nordic ski, walk, and snowmobile right over it. Though my favourite part was hanging and hot-tubbing in the cabin at Falcon Trails Resort - what a dreamy start to the trip.\n\n2. Turn (boiling) water into ice magic trick!\n\nOkay, so this may sound a little bit silly, but it is one thing you can only do when the temperature is well below freezing! Watch the vlog for a silly tutorial. ;)\n\n3.  Festival du Voyageur\n\nA Winnipeg special, Festival du Voyageur is a celebration of history and French, as well as indigenous, culture. You will see ice sculptures, a sugar shack with maple syrup taffy, as well as actors answering your questions in character from the fur trading time of the voyageurs.\n\n4.  The Forks lights\n\nThe area is illuminated with lights and 150 ice-skating trails in the winter, perfect for skating and hanging out at night!\n\n5. Therm\u00eba Spa\n\nThis place is SO GOOD! It is the perfect winter oasis. Surrounded by nature and providing a variety of saunas and pools, this spot requires a proper blog post detailing how to get the most out of your time: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/thermea-spa-winnipeg/\n\n6. Snow Maze\n\n A Maze in Corn not only has a formidable snow maze to explore, but also beautiful snow carvings inside some of the hidden rooms and an ice bar, too!\n\n7. Hockey game! \n\nFor many, Canada is synonymous with hockey, and I for one had to experience the sport in a place with truly passionate fans. What better way than to attend a Jets game?!\n\n8. Assiniboine Park Zoo\n\nThe seals and bears at the Assiniboine Park Zoo are rescues who were orphaned at birth and wouldn\u2019t survive in the wild. It\u2019s wonderful to see them swimming around above you!\n\n9. Mercedes AMG track\n\nGet your adrenaline going swerving around on a frozen Lake Winnipeg in a 6-figure car at the AMG Driving Academy. The intention is to spin and swerve, having a blast and learning how to drive in icy conditions in the process.\n\n10. Helicopter over Lake Winnipeg\n\nWhat a lovely way to get a bird\u2019s-eye view of the frozen lake! A scenic helicopter ride was the perfect ending to my winter adventures in Manitoba.\n\n\u21a0 For more awesome things to do in Winnipeg, Manitoba: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/winnipegs-best-things-to-do/\n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse\n\nThis vlog is brought to you by Travel Manitoba.

Kuthodaw Pagoda\n\nThe beginning of our pagoda party! Get lost in rows and rows of white pagodas that house the world's largest book at Kuthodaw Pagoda. In each pagoda you'll see inscriptions on large stone slabs in seemingly endless rows.\n\n3. Inwa, the Ancient Capital\n\nI loved exploring the wooden monastery, and the exterior may remind one of Angkor Was in Cambodia. There's a 10,000 kyat entrance fee, plus 1000 for the boat that takes you across to the ruins and back. Once you're there, getting around is limited to just horse-drawn carriages for 15,000 kyat. This is something to keep in mind, for sure!\n\n4. Umin Thonse - 30 Caves Pagoda\n\nThis one was really beautiful and intriguing! Each gold-framed doorway leads to a Buddha statue inside, and the whole area has a beautiful view. \n\n5. Hsinbyume Pagoda\n\nThis is definitely the cherry on top. Unlike any other religious site in the world, it's open to explore, walk on, and enjoy. It also looks very much like a beautiful wedding cake (watch the vlog to see what I mean!).\n\nFOR MORE INFO, READ THIS BLOG POST: \n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse",

                "description": "This experience changed my life.\n\nSwimming, freediving and dancing with whales around a secret island in French Polynesia is an experience I will never, ever forget. These gentle giants are elegant, intelligent and loving, and we were so blessed that a group of them chose to spend hours with us. We even got to see them breaching a few times! \n\nThe island feels like Eden, where the fishermen only need lines and spear guns, and the fruit trees are beyond prolific. I watched the locals of all ages perform Tahitian dancing at church (shown in the vlog). There must be at least a hundred families there for the event. It\u2019s not for tourists, and there aren\u2019t many at all, but I\u2019m welcome and it feels good. This whole island feels good. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been searching for it my whole life.\n\nI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I\u2019ll never name this place. If you find it, you\u2019ll know why. If you are trying to plan a similar trip, the best months to swim with whales in French Polynesia are between mid-August to October. I am also leading 2 small groups of women to do the exact same thing next September. The trips are now sold out, but you can join the waiting list here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/french-polynesia-whale-swim-trip/\n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0MORE RESOURCES:\nSolo female travel resources: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel/\n31 Solo Travel Safety Tips from 31 Solo Female Travelers: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel-safety/",

                    "description": "This experience changed my life.\n\nSwimming, freediving and dancing with whales around a secret island in French Polynesia is an experience I will never, ever forget. These gentle giants are elegant, intelligent and loving, and we were so blessed that a group of them chose to spend hours with us. We even got to see them breaching a few times! \n\nThe island feels like Eden, where the fishermen only need lines and spear guns, and the fruit trees are beyond prolific. I watched the locals of all ages perform Tahitian dancing at church (shown in the vlog). There must be at least a hundred families there for the event. It\u2019s not for tourists, and there aren\u2019t many at all, but I\u2019m welcome and it feels good. This whole island feels good. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been searching for it my whole life.\n\nI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I\u2019ll never name this place. If you find it, you\u2019ll know why. If you are trying to plan a similar trip, the best months to swim with whales in French Polynesia are between mid-August to October. I am also leading 2 small groups of women to do the exact same thing next September. The trips are now sold out, but you can join the waiting list here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/french-polynesia-whale-swim-trip/\n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0MORE RESOURCES:\nSolo female travel resources: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel/\n31 Solo Travel Safety Tips from 31 Solo Female Travelers: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel-safety/"

In this video, I will show you how I plan my shoot before my travels, how I get creative with my wardrobe to make myself pop in my photos, how I set my camera up to take advance selfies, or ask for help from others strategically, and finally, how I edit my photos for the gram!\n\n1. Research: I always begin my research on where my photos are going to end up - Instagram. By searching the geotag, I get to see the color palate I will be working with, and get some cool photo ideas. I do the same on Pinterest, and often get ideas on where to go and what to do in the area!\n\n2. Pack Accordingly: As I am almost always in my photos, I try to match my outfits with my surrounding! It's fun to get creative and play dress up.\n\n3. Survey Your Surrounding: Even though you've done your research, get creative and think about ways that you can do something totally different than what you\u2019ve seen before.\n\n4. Work it: In this video, I showed you how I took 3 of my photos - #1 was the breakfast photo with a stunning view at the back, #2 was a photo on a hilltop after walking along the Path of Gods for an hour, and #3 was a sunset photo! I used different techniques (tripod, asking a stranger, and using my surrounding to place my camera strategically) and the results were awesome!\n\n5. Post production:  I can guarantee you that 99.9% of all of your favorite photographers edit their photos, the vast majority of whom are using Lightroom. In the last part of this video, I demonstrated how I edited my photos to make them pop for the gram.\n\nI hope you enjoyed watching this video!

                "description": "How to go island hopping in Coron without the crowds!\n\nCoron has blown up in popularity over the last few years, so going on a group island hopping tour means sharing the space with many other tourists. I wanted an island hopping excursion without the crowds, so a private island hopping tour it is!\n\nI took it very slow and split things up over 2 days:\n\nDay 1: \n1. The Twin Lagoon: One of the most popular stops in Coron. We were able to get the lagoon pretty much to ourselves for a good few minutes, as we arrived before 8am. The Twin Lagoon was absolutely beautiful and very fun to fly a drone over, but just watch out for this ONE THING (watch the vlog to find out!).\n2. Keyangan Lake: This brackish lake is magical in the morning hours, but by 10am it\u2019s packed with people. If you want to skip the crowds, your only choice is to get there before 7:30am, which can be arranged if you are on a private tour.\n\nDay 2:\n1. Barracuda Lake: My absolute favorite out of all stops! I had it to myself for a while by going in the afternoon after the tour boats had mostly moved on. It\u2019s less popular, so to me it was more beautiful and pretty darn similar.\n2. Banul Beach: I headed to Banul Beach In the afternoon, after the tours that stop there for lunch had already left. It\u2019s a small cove with white sand beaches and though grassy and not perfect for snorkeling, it is absolutely perfect for chilling.\n\nAnd there you have it, an awesome Coron island hopping tour!

We both tried something for the first time - Paige hiked for the first time, and I rode a horse! It was the perfect girlfriend road trip/getaway. Watch the video to see what went down over the week.\n\nDay 1: The trip begins with a delicious brunch at Lemon Tree Co. at Boise, Idaho. We checked out some REALLY cool murals and took a bunch of photos and videos. The weather was amazing, and the vibe was awesome. Next, we had vegan donuts at Guru Donuts before dinner - we are on team dessert before dinner! Dinner was at Juniper. Again, everything was delicious, and we were both happy to start off the trip with a happy belly.\n\nDay 2: We drove to Kirkham and Bonneville Hot Springs. We had such a relaxing time. Next, we made our way to Stanley and went stand up paddleboarding (Paige's first time) on Redfish Lake. We ended the day with a beautiful sunset by the river.\n\nDay 3: Horse day! It's Paige's favorite thing to do, and it was facing a fear for me! I am still slightly terrified of horses, but our guide, Maddie, was totally awesome, and my horse for the day, Johnny was beautiful. We went on a BEAUTIFUL hike next, but that's for the next vlog. ;)\n\nFor a complete Idaho road trip itinerary (with stops that are not included in this vlog), check this blog post out: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/idaho-road-trip-itinerary/\n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0MORE RESOURCES:\nSolo female travel resources: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel/\n31 Solo Travel Safety Tips from 31 Solo Female Travelers: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel-safety/",

We went on a BEAUTIFUL hike next, but that's for the next vlog. ;)\n\nFor a complete Idaho road trip itinerary (with stops that are not included in this vlog), check this blog post out: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/idaho-road-trip-itinerary/\n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0MORE RESOURCES:\nSolo female travel resources: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel/\n31 Solo Travel Safety Tips from 31 Solo Female Travelers: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel-safety/"

                "channelId": "UCVdvbdhaXo01c1G4mNp1RsQ",
                "description": "Someone tried to break in to my bungalow in the Philippines.\n\nMy bungalow was almost broken into in the middle of the night. Thankfully, as soon as they realized there was a person inside, they ran away. I was not hurt nor robbed, but was certainly shaken.\n\nThis incident also woke me up and made me realize a few things about safety as a solo female traveler:\n\n1. Know that it can happen anywhere: It was certainly not the country\u2019s fault - bad things happen anywhere and everywhere. The same precautions should be taken wherever you travel to. I have always been relatively alert and only had 2 bad things happen to me in the last 7 years of traveling around the world mostly solo.\n\n2. It\u2019s usually done out of desperation: While this does not excuse the action, I can imagine that these things are usually done out of desperation - poverty is usually the main drive. I don\u2019t know what I would do if I am in a desperate position. Putting this perspective in the picture helped me handle the situation with empathy and kindness.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary delays: I will not sleep with no clothes on when I travel solo anymore. I had to grab some clothes and put them, which really delayed any opportunity to protect myself. If you need glasses to see, I suggest putting them within reach as well.\n\n4. Travel with a personal alarm / door jam: Have something that would help you make loud noises to let others know that you are in distress, or pack a door jam with you in your travels. \n\n5. Whenever possible, stay off the ground: It\u2019s much more difficult to try to break into a room that\u2019s high up! If you are staying in a hotel, try to ask for a room that\u2019s above the 2nd level. This will make you a less likely target.\n\n6. Self defense: Pick up self defense skills and PRACTICE them! You will never know when skills like this would come in handy. There are many tutorials available online. The one I watched in this video is from: \n\n7. Adhere to your own rules: the both times bad things (sexual assault and snatch theft) happened to me, were when I broke my own rules by walking alone at night and by not clasping my bag to secure my belongings. I'm not totally victim blaming myself here, but am saying to always watch out for yourself and avoid getting into a risky situation!\n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0MORE RESOURCES:\nSolo female travel resources: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel/\n31 Solo Travel Safety Tips from 31 Solo Female Travelers: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel-safety/",

                    "description": "Someone tried to break in to my bungalow in the Philippines.\n\nMy bungalow was almost broken into in the middle of the night. Thankfully, as soon as they realized there was a person inside, they ran away. I was not hurt nor robbed, but was certainly shaken.\n\nThis incident also woke me up and made me realize a few things about safety as a solo female traveler:\n\n1. Know that it can happen anywhere: It was certainly not the country\u2019s fault - bad things happen anywhere and everywhere. The same precautions should be taken wherever you travel to. I have always been relatively alert and only had 2 bad things happen to me in the last 7 years of traveling around the world mostly solo.\n\n2. It\u2019s usually done out of desperation: While this does not excuse the action, I can imagine that these things are usually done out of desperation - poverty is usually the main drive. I don\u2019t know what I would do if I am in a desperate position. Putting this perspective in the picture helped me handle the situation with empathy and kindness.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary delays: I will not sleep with no clothes on when I travel solo anymore. I had to grab some clothes and put them, which really delayed any opportunity to protect myself. If you need glasses to see, I suggest putting them within reach as well.\n\n4. Travel with a personal alarm / door jam: Have something that would help you make loud noises to let others know that you are in distress, or pack a door jam with you in your travels. \n\n5. Whenever possible, stay off the ground: It\u2019s much more difficult to try to break into a room that\u2019s high up! If you are staying in a hotel, try to ask for a room that\u2019s above the 2nd level. This will make you a less likely target.\n\n6. Self defense: Pick up self defense skills and PRACTICE them! You will never know when skills like this would come in handy. There are many tutorials available online. The one I watched in this video is from: \n\n7. Adhere to your own rules: the both times bad things (sexual assault and snatch theft) happened to me, were when I broke my own rules by walking alone at night and by not clasping my bag to secure my belongings. I'm not totally victim blaming myself here, but am saying to always watch out for yourself and avoid getting into a risky situation!\n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0MORE RESOURCES:\nSolo female travel resources: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel/\n31 Solo Travel Safety Tips from 31 Solo Female Travelers: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel-safety/"

Besides the famous Bon Bon Beach, my guide took me to 4 other cool spots:\n\n1. Bon Bon Beach: Bon Bon Beach sandbar is Romblon Island\u2019s most famous feature. There were hundreds of people on it during low tide, so we left and came back during high tide. I recommend doing the same as the experience without too many people around was just so much better!\n\n2. Tiamban Beach: This beautiful beach was decorated with palm trees, white sands and crystal clear water! It's great for relaxing and soaking in the calm water.\n\n3. Logbon Beach: The Logbon Pool forms during certain time of the year, which I was not able to see in April, but it was great for snorkeling. Like Tiamban Beach, the water was calm and crystal clear.\n\n4. Marakay Marakay Island Diving Board: If cliff jumping is your thing, be sure to make a stop at the Marakay Marakay Island Diving Board! You will see many local kids climbing and jumping off the cliff, so join the party!\n\n5. Tinagong Dagat: Apart from Bon Bon, Tinagong Dagat was one of the things I wanted to see most during my Romblon Island hopping trip. I loved soaking in the water surrounded by cool rock formations!

                "description": "WANNA DO THE SAME (but in French Polynesia)? Join me next September: eepurl.com/dEXn2r \n\nSwimming, snorkeling and freediving with whales and dolphins in Tonga. \n\nSwimming with whales in the wild and open has been a long-time dream of mine. The whales usually start to show up in late July to early August and stay until mid-October. It\u2019s hard to pick a sweet spot within that timeframe as any week has the potential to have tons of whale sightings, or not. Some days will be packed with whale swims while others might only have one or none. Humpback whales are wild animals and since the boats don\u2019t feed or coax them into interactions, there are never any guarantees.\n\nWe definitely got lucky, though! Seven of us headed out on a speed boat off of the island of Vava\u2019u, Tonga, and we were one of only 10-15 boats out on the water that day, and each of the six days that we spent swimming with the whales. We hung out with a mother whale with calfs, singing male whales, and witnessed a couple of heat runs, led by a female in heat and involving several male whales all vying for a chance to mate with her. Not only did we swim with several whales, but four dolphins as well! The trip finished with a beautiful swim in a crystal clear cave full of tiny, glittering fish.\n\nI\u2019m forever changed after this experience.

Join me next September: eepurl.com/dEXn2r \n\nSwimming, snorkeling and freediving with whales and dolphins in Tonga. \n\nSwimming with whales in the wild and open has been a long-time dream of mine. The whales usually start to show up in late July to early August and stay until mid-October. It\u2019s hard to pick a sweet spot within that timeframe as any week has the potential to have tons of whale sightings, or not. Some days will be packed with whale swims while others might only have one or none. Humpback whales are wild animals and since the boats don\u2019t feed or coax them into interactions, there are never any guarantees.\n\nWe definitely got lucky, though! Seven of us headed out on a speed boat off of the island of Vava\u2019u, Tonga, and we were one of only 10-15 boats out on the water that day, and each of the six days that we spent swimming with the whales. We hung out with a mother whale with calfs, singing male whales, and witnessed a couple of heat runs, led by a female in heat and involving several male whales all vying for a chance to mate with her. Not only did we swim with several whales, but four dolphins as well! The trip finished with a beautiful swim in a crystal clear cave full of tiny, glittering fish.\n\nI\u2019m forever changed after this experience.

The objective was simple: Soak is as many beautiful places as possible and find the best ones. It was a smashing success. Here's where we went:\n\nIdaho City Hot Springs: A nice big pool, private jacuzzis, and even a steam bath. This one isn't a natural one and you do have to pay to use it but it's a nice stop between Boise and Stanley.\n\nKirkham Hot Springs: A popular one in Idaho, it's pretty nice in the winter months when there are fewer people around. This hot spring features waterfalls and a bunch of different pools and best of all, it's nice and HOT. \n\nMountain Village Resort Hot Springs: The first stop in Stanley, Mountain Village has its own little barn hot spring that you can use when you stay at the hotel. \n\nBoat/Boater Box hot springs: This little tub on the river is adorable and a nice little place to soak. \n\nSunbeam hot springs: My personal favorite, this hot spring is so nice and hot and it's also the only one I had all to myself! It's just 10 minutes down the road from Boater box. \n\nGoldbug Hot Spring: Idaho's most famous but for good reason. This one requires a 2-mile hike in and you get rewarded with hot springs of various temperatures and an incredible view. \n\nFor more hot springs that weren't featured in this video along with a map and suggestions on where to stay, read the blog post: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/idaho-guide/\n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook : https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse",

                    "description": "Where are the Best hot springs in Idaho?\n\nHere's the blog post with the full itinerary: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/idaho-hot-springs/\n\nI went on a little road trip last week to find the best of the best hot springs in Idaho, beginning in Boise. The objective was simple: Soak is as many beautiful places as possible and find the best ones. It was a smashing success. Here's where we went:\n\nIdaho City Hot Springs: A nice big pool, private jacuzzis, and even a steam bath. This one isn't a natural one and you do have to pay to use it but it's a nice stop between Boise and Stanley.\n\nKirkham Hot Springs: A popular one in Idaho, it's pretty nice in the winter months when there are fewer people around. This hot spring features waterfalls and a bunch of different pools and best of all, it's nice and HOT. \n\nMountain Village Resort Hot Springs: The first stop in Stanley, Mountain Village has its own little barn hot spring that you can use when you stay at the hotel. \n\nBoat/Boater Box hot springs: This little tub on the river is adorable and a nice little place to soak. \n\nSunbeam hot springs: My personal favorite, this hot spring is so nice and hot and it's also the only one I had all to myself! It's just 10 minutes down the road from Boater box. \n\nGoldbug Hot Spring: Idaho's most famous but for good reason. This one requires a 2-mile hike in and you get rewarded with hot springs of various temperatures and an incredible view. \n\nFor more hot springs that weren't featured in this video along with a map and suggestions on where to stay, read the blog post: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/idaho-guide/\n\n\u21a0 SUBSCRIBE for solo travel advice around the world \u21a0 http://www.youtube.com/bemytravelmuse\n\n\u21a0 CONNECT WITH ME: \nhttps://www.bemytravelmuse.com\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/bemytravelmuse\nFacebook : https://facebook.com/bemytravelmuse"

Kristen has been living the #vanlife for years and she invited me along for a week of adventures with zero plans and obligations. This is what we randomly decided to see:\n\nDead Horse State Park outside of Moab, Utah. It's amazing in the winter with snow, and you can apply for a drone permit in the winter months! \n\nFrom there we made our way south past the Needles Overlook of Canyonlands National Park down to a personal favorite of mine, Valley of the Gods. \n\nEach night, we camped in BLM (Bureau of Land Management) spots like this where camping is free provided you leave no trace and are cool with having no facilities. \n\nFrom there we headed into Arizona for Canyon de Chelly, and back up towards Natural Bridges National Monument, stopping for the night at an incredible overlook that was once again BLM land. \n\nNext we ventured through Hite in Glen Canyon and onwards to Goblin Valley state park and Little Wild Horse Canyon. Since it looked like rain we skipped the entire slot canyon and headed to the Temple of the Sun and Moon at Capitol Reef National Park. \n\nWe managed to spend almost the entire time without seeing any other people in Southern Utah's Secret, off the beaten path places.

We had a life-changing dining experience at the restaurant and interviewed the head-chef, Yubako Kamohara to find out firsthand, what it\u2019s like being a woman in the food and restaurant industry in Japan, and what aspirations she has for other female chefs who are finding their place in Japan's elite culinary scene.\n\nTsurutokame has earned its well deserved fame since its opening, with a current waiting list that\u2019s months-long. Part of its popularity is due to how economical the experience is at only 10,000\u00a5 to 16,000\u00a5, which is unheard of for Kaiseki, as well as how varied the menu is. We devored 10 delicate dishes carefully curated by the female chefs - the menu changes on a daily basis, with all chefs working together to decide on the techniques, styles and flavors to be implemented for the night. The chefs even curated a full vegan Kaiseki menu for me, while serving the rest of the restaurant their traditional menu. They put just as much effort into my food as everyone else\u2019s and it really showed. This alone blows me away, since many high-level chefs will simply refuse a vegan diner or any kind of special order.\n\nKaiseki is one of the best dining experiences one can have in Tokyo. More than a traditional multi-course dinner, Kaiseki is also is the epitome of Japanese haute cuisine and is considered the highest-level genre of restaurant in Japan. Kaiseki is not just a meal, it is an art form. If you are planning a trip to Tokyo soon, be sure to include this in your foodie list. Since it's so popular, it's best to book seats as early as you know you'll be in Tokyo.\n\nFor more information on how you can have the same Kaiseki experience at Tsurutokame, READ THIS BLOG POST: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tsurutokame-tokyo/",

For someone who loves all things sparkly and unique, Harajuku is a shopping paradise.\n\nFor those with a sweet tooth, Harajuku delivers! You will find crepes with hundreds of flavor selections at places like Santa Monica, rainbow cotton candy, and customizable ice cream at Eddy\u2019s along the streets of Harajuku.

It was my first time using the customizable photo booth which makes your eyes bigger and lips and cheeks redder.

How can you earn airline miles without having to wait forever or fly a bunch of times? The answer is by travel hacking!\n\nI've been travel hacking for almost 2 years now and during that time I've flown around the world, twice in business class, almost for free. In each case, I just pay taxes which could be as cheap as $30, to fly from Berlin to Lima, Cusco, LA, Thailand, and back again. \n\nHow have I done it? By using attractive signup bonuses offered by credit card companies to rack up points. These are the cards that I mentioned in the video: \n\nhttps://bit.ly/2La7gp2\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2J0yL7V\n\nYou can read more about specific methods and schemes I use that I didn't cover in the video on my blog: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-fly-for-free/\n\nFind Nomadic Matt's book on travel hacking here: https://www.nomadicmatt.com/guide-to-travel-hacking/",

How can you earn airline miles without having to wait forever or fly a bunch of times? The answer is by travel hacking!\n\nI've been travel hacking for almost 2 years now and during that time I've flown around the world, twice in business class, almost for free. In each case, I just pay taxes which could be as cheap as $30, to fly from Berlin to Lima, Cusco, LA, Thailand, and back again. \n\nHow have I done it? By using attractive signup bonuses offered by credit card companies to rack up points. These are the cards that I mentioned in the video: \n\nhttps://bit.ly/2La7gp2\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2J0yL7V\n\nYou can read more about specific methods and schemes I use that I didn't cover in the video on my blog: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-fly-for-free/\n\nFind Nomadic Matt's book on travel hacking here: https://www.nomadicmatt.com/guide-to-travel-hacking/"

We also ziplined in the rainforest canopy and celebrated my birthday, all in one amazing trip. \n\nFor more about upcoming tours and to reserve your spot on next year's Peru tour, check out the tours page on my blog: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tours/\n\nSpecial Thanks to Tahuayo Lodge for sharing your footage of the pink dolphins!",

We also ziplined in the rainforest canopy and celebrated my birthday, all in one amazing trip. \n\nFor more about upcoming tours and to reserve your spot on next year's Peru tour, check out the tours page on my blog: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tours/\n\nSpecial Thanks to Tahuayo Lodge for sharing your footage of the pink dolphins!"

Never heard of it? This remote area in the far east of Indonesia is one of the hottest new places for diving in Indonesia. It's a large area with thousands of islets, most of which are uninhabited. It's like a Robinson Crusoe life in the middle of nowhere - the most beautiful middle of nowhere. \n\nI joined the Mutiara Laut liveaboard for 11 days of SCUBA diving in Raja Ampat's Misool, Penemu, and Kri areas, known for big schools of fish, Manta rays, Wobbegong sharks, reef sharks, and absolutely gorgeous islands. \n\nThis video features underwater footage of sea turtles, tons of fish, sea fans, a wide variety of corals, and drone footage of the islands of Raja Ampat. \n\nThe video begins in Sorong, which is the starting point for divers boarding a liveaboard in Raja Ampat. From there we head to Misool and onwards up north to Penemu. Most of the islands and beaches featured here have no other people -just birds! \n\nCheck out these white sand beaches, incredible sunsets, and the amazing crew and ship, the Mutiara Laut.

The amazing floating pagodas are a magnificent feat of human strength and artistry. \n\nNext, we head to the Emerald Lake of Tham Pha National Park, another hidden gem of Lampang province. It's a sinkhole in the jungle filled with crystal clear blue water and tons of fish! It's considered holy, therefore there's no swimming or fishing, but just taking a look at it is incredible. \n\nFor this trip, we're also joined by Pete, my adventure tour partner.

It's a sinkhole in the jungle filled with crystal clear blue water and tons of fish! It's considered holy, therefore there's no swimming or fishing, but just taking a look at it is incredible. \n\nFor this trip, we're also joined by Pete, my adventure tour partner. Check out the tours here! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tours\n\nREAD MORE plus maps for how to get to these amazing places yourself: \n- Wat Chaloem: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/wat-chaloem-phra-kiat/\n- Emerald Lake: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/emerald-lake-lampang-thailand/"
