I saw one, in particular, that I really liked and wanted to learn how to do it. After searching for a while, I realized that the edit was a bit too specific to find a tutorial for by itself, so I did a bit of studying on how to use various tricks in Adobe After Effects and was able to teach myself to replicate the edit that I liked. \n\nThis is what led me to make this video today. I wanted to share what I learned with anybody else who wanted to make something similar so the world can have more cool effects and more dope content. \nI'm not a pro when it comes to After Effects, but I can help shed some light on what is needed to make this particular effect achievable for anyone interested in learning.\n\nHopefully, this video will be able to bridge the gap for a lot of people who have the will the create similar effects but not the know-how. \n\nGood luck everyone!\n----------------------\n\nEdit by Parker Heuser\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\u200b\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\nMUSIC LICENSED FROM MONSTERCAT AND EPIDEMICSOUND:\nhttps://www.monstercat.com/\nhttps://www.epidemicsound.com/\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\u200b\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

                    "description": "What's going on friends!\n\nIn the last few months, I've been seeing more and more cool edit effects on various social media platforms and accounts. I saw one, in particular, that I really liked and wanted to learn how to do it. After searching for a while, I realized that the edit was a bit too specific to find a tutorial for by itself, so I did a bit of studying on how to use various tricks in Adobe After Effects and was able to teach myself to replicate the edit that I liked. \n\nThis is what led me to make this video today. I wanted to share what I learned with anybody else who wanted to make something similar so the world can have more cool effects and more dope content. \nI'm not a pro when it comes to After Effects, but I can help shed some light on what is needed to make this particular effect achievable for anyone interested in learning.\n\nHopefully, this video will be able to bridge the gap for a lot of people who have the will the create similar effects but not the know-how. \n\nGood luck everyone!\n----------------------\n\nEdit by Parker Heuser\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\u200b\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\nMUSIC LICENSED FROM MONSTERCAT AND EPIDEMICSOUND:\nhttps://www.monstercat.com/\nhttps://www.epidemicsound.com/\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\u200b\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

                "description": "\"What does it mean to be high on life? More than anything it's an attitude and lifestyle. Being high on life is a choice you make. It's accepting life as a beautiful gift, full of opportunity and depth. It's seeing the world as it was meant to be seen; in full colour and vivid detail. In abundance and diversity. It's living with an attitude of gratitude. Appreciating the good as well as the bad, knowing one cannot exist without the other.\n\nIt's being in a state of flow, in a current of inspiration. It's moving forward in life without being affected by what's going on around you. Choosing to see challenges as opportunities, not threats. Realizing that you are ultimately in control of your happiness. It's making relationships that move you to the depth of your being. You love with those who love. You have fun with those who have fun. You weep with those who weep. \n\nYou take the ride of life and find a way to feel deep joy wherever it takes you, going farther together than you ever could alone. It's making every day count knowing full well it could be gone tomorrow. Knowing that each day is brimming with a life of its own. Waking up with the understanding and anticipation that life can and will change again. Without the weight of yesterday affecting you today.\n\nIt's living without fear. Without the fear of being judged, without the fear of what could go wrong, without needing to know how everything is going to come together. Just free. Free to laugh and to love, free to play and explore, free to move forward no matter what the world throws at you. Surrendering to what is, and trusting in what's to come.\n\nMost importantly, being high on life is a commitment. You make the choice to enjoy life and you do it no matter what happens. In the end, if you stay high on life, you win. You get for free what everyone struggles for. And if you're high on life, you'll attract those people and circumstances that fuel your fire. As you radiate positivity, the world brings you more of what you love.\"\n\n\n----------------------\n\nEdit by Parker Heuser\nWritten by Parker Heuser & Regan Jacklin\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\u200b\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\nMUSIC LICENSED FROM MONSTERCAT:\nhttps://www.monstercat.com/\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\u200b\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

It's accepting life as a beautiful gift, full of opportunity and depth. It's seeing the world as it was meant to be seen; in full colour and vivid detail. In abundance and diversity. It's living with an attitude of gratitude. Appreciating the good as well as the bad, knowing one cannot exist without the other.\n\nIt's being in a state of flow, in a current of inspiration. It's moving forward in life without being affected by what's going on around you. Choosing to see challenges as opportunities, not threats. Realizing that you are ultimately in control of your happiness. It's making relationships that move you to the depth of your being. You love with those who love. You have fun with those who have fun. You weep with those who weep. \n\nYou take the ride of life and find a way to feel deep joy wherever it takes you, going farther together than you ever could alone. It's making every day count knowing full well it could be gone tomorrow. Knowing that each day is brimming with a life of its own.

Although there was an abundance of snow, and we wore snowshoes, the trail is used daily by other visitors and was fairly packed down. If you have good boots and pants, snowshoes may not be needed when sticking diligently to the center of the path. As the snowfalls change overnight, conditions will change, so do your research ahead of time.\n\nGet all the info at https://mtseymour.ca/ \n----------------------\n\nEdit by Parker Heuser\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\u200b\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\nMUSIC LICENSED FROM MONSTERCAT:\nhttps://www.monstercat.com/\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\u200b\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

Although there was an abundance of snow, and we wore snowshoes, the trail is used daily by other visitors and was fairly packed down. If you have good boots and pants, snowshoes may not be needed when sticking diligently to the center of the path. As the snowfalls change overnight, conditions will change, so do your research ahead of time.\n\nGet all the info at https://mtseymour.ca/ \n----------------------\n\nEdit by Parker Heuser\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\u200b\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\u200b\n\nMUSIC LICENSED FROM MONSTERCAT:\nhttps://www.monstercat.com/\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\u200b\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

But the restrictions on travel and socializing has caused a big shift in what we're able to do. However, sitting at home day in and day out is extremely challenging for some of us. Our mental health is being put to the test and with limitations on our freedom, so too were we experiencing limitations on our happiness.\n\nThis week's video was made to show an alternative to international travel and to show ways in which we could still get outside, have a little adventure, and most importantly keep safe. We like to promote fun and adventure, so we treated our day as if we were tourists in our own city and biked around town to see what the beautiful city of Vancouver has to offer. \n\nIt may not be as riveting as actually going to a new destination and seeing new landscapes, but for those of you who haven't done a tour of Vancouver, I hope you can get a little bit of an experience by joining us along this ride. \n\nFor more information about our means of transport, go check out the Rad Power Bikes website:\nhttps://www.radpowerbikes.com/\n\n----------------------\n\nEdit by Tom Belding @theTomBelding\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/thearjunmalik\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

We like to promote fun and adventure, so we treated our day as if we were tourists in our own city and biked around town to see what the beautiful city of Vancouver has to offer. \n\nIt may not be as riveting as actually going to a new destination and seeing new landscapes, but for those of you who haven't done a tour of Vancouver, I hope you can get a little bit of an experience by joining us along this ride. \n\nFor more information about our means of transport, go check out the Rad Power Bikes website:\nhttps://www.radpowerbikes.com/\n\n----------------------\n\nEdit by Tom Belding @theTomBelding\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/thearjunmalik\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

One that requires social distancing, face masks, and constant hand sanitizing. Not to forget sanitizing floor mats at every entrance and body thermal detection guns... Not going to lie to you, there were some very strict protocols in place, not only in taking an international flight but even just walking around in public. \n\nLos Cabos however, was very on top of following the regulations and guidelines placed to ensure limiting the spread of the invisible enemy we know as Covid19. Every staff member in the city was diligently following protocol to give visitors the safest and friendliest experience they could have. \nAnd it showed!\n\nGlad you could join us today to follow along with our experience venturing out to Los Cabos, Mexico. \nWe didn't do an in-depth assessment of how the pandemic was affecting daily life, but we can certainly speak from experience, so if you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to comment below so that Parker can get back to you with an answer. \n\nStay healthy, stay safe everyone!\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Parker \u2022 http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Justis \u2022 http://instagram.com/justis\n\u2022 Kenzo \u2022 http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nSPECIAL GUESTS:\n\u2022 Colin \u2022 http://instagram.com/thecolindougan\n\u2022 Danny\u2022 http://instagram.com/mcgee\n\u2022 Beth\u2022 http://instagram.com/bethwalkemeyer\n\n---------------------\n\nIf High On Life has inspired you to travel and reach for your dreams, use the #HOLInspired hashtag to share your stories or personal experiences!\n\n#HighOnLife #HoLInspired #LoveTravel",

Not going to lie to you, there were some very strict protocols in place, not only in taking an international flight but even just walking around in public. \n\nLos Cabos however, was very on top of following the regulations and guidelines placed to ensure limiting the spread of the invisible enemy we know as Covid19. Every staff member in the city was diligently following protocol to give visitors the safest and friendliest experience they could have. \nAnd it showed!\n\nGlad you could join us today to follow along with our experience venturing out to Los Cabos, Mexico. \nWe didn't do an in-depth assessment of how the pandemic was affecting daily life, but we can certainly speak from experience, so if you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to comment below so that Parker can get back to you with an answer. \n\nStay healthy, stay safe everyone!\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Parker \u2022 http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Justis \u2022 http://instagram.com/justis\n\u2022 Kenzo \u2022 http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nSPECIAL GUESTS:\n\u2022 Colin \u2022 http://instagram.com/thecolindougan\n\u2022 Danny\u2022 http://instagram.com/mcgee\n\u2022 Beth\u2022 http://instagram.com/bethwalkemeyer\n\n---------------------\n\nIf High On Life has inspired you to travel and reach for your dreams, use the #HOLInspired hashtag to share your stories or personal experiences!\n\n#HighOnLife #HoLInspired #LoveTravel"

The city is circled by fortified walls, and full of minarets, mosques, and open-air mausoleums, we even stayed in, and old madrassah turned into a hotel. \n\nUzbekistan was an unexpected destination for us, and the city of Khiva was the first time on the trip we really felt the rich culture and history of Uzbekistan. \n\nWe landed in the city of Tashkent for the World Influencer Congress after a day of conference activities we started our 5 day Silk Road journey across the country.\n\nStay tuned for our next vlog travelling Uzbekistan when we visit, Bukhara, Samarkand and fully explore Tashkent.\n\nBIG THANKS TO:\nThe entire World Influencers Congress team https://www.instagram.com/worldinfluencerscongress/\n#visituzbekistan #wicuzbekistan\n\nNarrated by Parker Heuser\nFilmed on location by: \nBen Czegeny, Kenzo Kiren, Justis Cooper and Parker Heuser\nEdited by Steve Bradley\nProduced by: Ben Czegeny\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Parker \u2022 http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Justis \u2022 http://instagram.com/justis\n\u2022 Kenzo \u2022 http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\u2022 Josh \u2022 http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap\n\u2022 Ben \u2022 http://instagram.com/benczegeny\n\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

                "description": "What the best travel camera? We believe will answer that question once and for all with this video! \n\nSurprisingly, the best camera isn\u2019t a top of the line DSLR like the Canon 5D IV or the Sony A7R III, but instead, an all-in-one camera from SONY called the RX10 IV. Josh, our resident editor, is here to share some of the top reasons as to why this camera is the best for travelers.\n\n#1 Portability/Weight - This thing only weighs 1 kilogram! \n\n#2 Face-Tracking Technology - There\u2019s nothing worse than a blurry face, right? Well, this technology keeps your face tack sharp.\n\n#3 Insane 24-600mm all-in-one lens - Instead of lugging around multiple lenses, now you just have to carry around one!\n\n#4 Amazing Cinematic Options - with the 120fps 1080p video capability, getting amazing travel video has never been easier. 1080p and 4k capabilities!\n\n#5 In-Body Stabilization - This feature helps greatly if you\u2019ve got a shaky set of hands.\n\nOf course, this is just our opinion but this all-in-one camera has become part of our filmmaking arsenal and many times we\u2019re completely blown away by the kinds of footage we can get out of it. \n\nSo if you\u2019re in the market for a new travel camera, get this one!\n\nDisclaimer: This video is not a sponsored post and solely reflects the opinions of High On Life. \n\n---------------------\n\nBUY THE SONY RX10 IV:\nhttps://amzn.to/2VekqtZ\n\n---------------------\n\nEdit by Joshua Laplap\nWritten by Joshua Laplap & Parker Heuser\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Parker \u2022 http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Dan \u2022 http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n\u2022 Justis \u2022 http://instagram.com/justis\n\u2022 Kenzo \u2022 http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\u2022 Josh \u2022 http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap\n\u2022 Arjun \u2022 http://instagram.com/badtothebone\n\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

                    "description": "What the best travel camera? We believe will answer that question once and for all with this video! \n\nSurprisingly, the best camera isn\u2019t a top of the line DSLR like the Canon 5D IV or the Sony A7R III, but instead, an all-in-one camera from SONY called the RX10 IV. Josh, our resident editor, is here to share some of the top reasons as to why this camera is the best for travelers.\n\n#1 Portability/Weight - This thing only weighs 1 kilogram! \n\n#2 Face-Tracking Technology - There\u2019s nothing worse than a blurry face, right? Well, this technology keeps your face tack sharp.\n\n#3 Insane 24-600mm all-in-one lens - Instead of lugging around multiple lenses, now you just have to carry around one!\n\n#4 Amazing Cinematic Options - with the 120fps 1080p video capability, getting amazing travel video has never been easier. 1080p and 4k capabilities!\n\n#5 In-Body Stabilization - This feature helps greatly if you\u2019ve got a shaky set of hands.\n\nOf course, this is just our opinion but this all-in-one camera has become part of our filmmaking arsenal and many times we\u2019re completely blown away by the kinds of footage we can get out of it. \n\nSo if you\u2019re in the market for a new travel camera, get this one!\n\nDisclaimer: This video is not a sponsored post and solely reflects the opinions of High On Life. \n\n---------------------\n\nBUY THE SONY RX10 IV:\nhttps://amzn.to/2VekqtZ\n\n---------------------\n\nEdit by Joshua Laplap\nWritten by Joshua Laplap & Parker Heuser\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Parker \u2022 http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Dan \u2022 http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n\u2022 Justis \u2022 http://instagram.com/justis\n\u2022 Kenzo \u2022 http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\u2022 Josh \u2022 http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap\n\u2022 Arjun \u2022 http://instagram.com/badtothebone\n\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

Now, with over 50 countries visited, she has an incredibly dialed-in travel business and continues to inspire men and women around the world. \n\nHer long journey from YouTube sketch comedy artist to YouTube travel vlogger and now a major player in the travel influencer space has been inspirational to many people, including us here at High On Life. In fact, she was the one who told us about working with travel brands in the first place!\n\nOn the podcast today, we covered as much as we could; everything from varsity golf to solo travel safety tips, and even tips on how to achieve YouTube fame (hint: it\u2019s possible, but not quick). \n\nWe were so excited to have her share knowledge on many aspects of the travel world.

As word of this movement spread in Vancouver, so did the number of people who wanted to get together in the early, early hours of the morning to seek this unique adventure.\n\nIn this podcast, we sat down with Julian to talk about how this movement has evolved to have more kinds of adventures (driving to Mexico for tacos is one of them) and include more kinds of adventure-seekers. \n\nThis was our longest podcast yet, so brew your favourite coffee and tea as we talked, laughed and got real about what's going on in our lives today.\n\nIf you've got any similar crazy spontaneous adventures that you'd love to share with us, leave us a comment below!

                    "description": "#HoLPodcast #HoLInspired #HighOnLife\n\nThis week on the podcast, we are so stoked to have Julian DeSchutter join us on the podcast.\n\nJulian leads a movement known as Chasing Sunrise, which started out as a group of friends wanting to do the things that they really wanted to do, which included meeting up at 3am in parking lots so that they could hike mountains to catch the sunrise at the peak. As word of this movement spread in Vancouver, so did the number of people who wanted to get together in the early, early hours of the morning to seek this unique adventure.\n\nIn this podcast, we sat down with Julian to talk about how this movement has evolved to have more kinds of adventures (driving to Mexico for tacos is one of them) and include more kinds of adventure-seekers. \n\nThis was our longest podcast yet, so brew your favourite coffee and tea as we talked, laughed and got real about what's going on in our lives today.\n\nIf you've got any similar crazy spontaneous adventures that you'd love to share with us, leave us a comment below!

                "description": "Are you really traveling? It\u2019s an interesting question, we know. But it\u2019s something we want you all to look deep inside and ask yourselves - Are you getting the most out of your hard earned vacations and adventures?\n\nTraveling and exploring the world is more than a passion for us. It\u2019s a way of life. Every new country we visit and culture we experience shows us a new perspective that we have never seen before, and brings wisdom, joy, understanding and sometimes even grief. The world is a complex place, and for those of you who wish to uncover it, we want to be with you on this journey of discovering this crazy and beautiful planet.\n\nIf you find yourself in a place where you think that you\u2019re stuck and want more out of your future trips, well, it\u2019s never too late. Take a look at 18-year-old Justis, for example. Going from all-inclusive resorts and \"living your best life\" to seeking out more authentic experiences and actually setting goals to ensure that he got the most out of his experience, didn't happen overnight, but it was a decision Justis made based on his desire to seek out personal growth through travel. Use this video as a guide to seek out the incredible and break out of your comfort zone. Sometimes all it takes is one step in the right direction, and you could be off on a journey you never thought possible.\n\nThank you so much to everyone that watched the video and has stuck with us during this past year. We literally make these videos just for you and we love the positivity and light you bring to our lives. We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the video, what you\u2019d like to see more of, what you\u2019d like to see less of, and even just to say hi. \n\nYou guys are all High On Life.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nEdit by Joshua Laplap\nWritten by Justis Cooper\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Parker \u2022 http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Dan \u2022 http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n\u2022 Justis \u2022 http://instagram.com/justis\n\u2022 Kenzo \u2022 http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\u2022 Josh \u2022 http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap\n\u2022 Arjun \u2022 http://instagram.com/badtothebone\n\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice message!

There is always something to do, and it seems like we are constantly doing something. Your friends are just a few taps of your finger away, strangers from around the world are interacting with your social media accounts at all times of the day and night, and you get notified everytime it happens. You work in a competitive environment, your boss has more and more tasks for you, and you find yourself telling more people that \u201cyou\u2019ll try to find time\u201d. The world is so busy, we've started creating shortcuts for things. Fast-food restaurants are flourishing because we don't always have enough time to cook and eat a meal. Cars have phone holders so you can have conversations and \"be productive\" while you drive. Caffeinated beverages are sold everywhere, to give you that little energy boost, so that you can do more with the little time you seem to have in the day.\n \nAnd then at the end of it, all you're left with is \"I'm too tired\".\n \nBut how much time are you spending on you?\n \nJust because you're busy, does that mean you're being effective or efficient with your time?\n \nThis video is a reminder of the physical and psychological benefits of spending time alone.\n \nYou get to take a break from daily life. A chance to shut off all the noise and distractions, and a chance to give your brain the rest it needs. Just like any other muscle in your body, your brain begins to fatigue over time. By taking even 10 minutes to relax, you will rejuvenate your mind and be able to think more clearly and more effectively.\nThis helps to improve your concentration and allows you to focus on what is most important to you. By getting a clear understanding of your priorities, you will become more productive in tackling them.\nThere may be times where you don\u2019t know the answer to a problem, or the appropriate steps to take to solve it. Finding the answers you need is significantly more challenging when you\u2019re distracted by incoming information. Turn your phone off and spend some time alone. You might be surprised how clearly solutions come to you when you\u2019re focussing on them without distractions.\nBy spending time with yourself and gaining a better understanding of who you are and what you desire in life, you\u2019re more likely to make better choices about who you want to be around. Which, in turn, can make you appreciate your relationships with others even more.\nProbably the most important benefit to solitude is learning more about who you are. What makes you happy, what gives you joy. Recognize your strengths and weaknesses. Analyze your flaws. Free your mind from negativity. Strengthen your appreciation for the little things in life.\n \nWhat you do, and how you spend your time tells you who you are. You cannot pour from an empty cup. If you are not giving to yourself, you will not be able to adequately give to others.\n \nRemember: nobody is too busy. It\u2019s just a matter of priorities.\nWhen\u2019s the last time you cooked a meal for yourself?\nAre you getting as much exercise as you\u2019d like to be?\nHow many books have you read in the last 3 months?\nHave you traveled anywhere new and exciting lately?\n \nGo for a walk\nTake a hike\nMake a list\nHave a bath\nListen to your favorite music\nWrite a letter to your family\nDo a crossword puzzle/Sudoku\n \nWhat kind of investments are you making in you?",

And coincidentally, we celebrated one of our good friends, Zachary Moxley.\n\nThe Sea To Sky Highway is an iconic and a must do for those who want to experience Vancouver. It just begins to scratch the surface of what British Columbia has to offer. The province is extremely vast, after all. \n\nWe found ourselves at Whistler to experience an incredible bungee jump (look at the location!), before hitting up a Mexican restaurant for some lunch. Be sure to see Zach scarf down that burrito. It's a hilarious sight. And to top off the day, we spent our time wake surfing down in Deep Cove! And of course we had to fit in some of those classic HoL backflips and gainers \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n---------------------\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO THE FOLLOWING:\n\u2022 Zach \u2022 http://instagram.com/downtofilm\n\u2022 Kyle \u2022 http://instagram.com/kyleslee\n\u2022 Jacob \u2022 http://instagram.com/jacobcrawfordfilm\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Parker \u2022 http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Dan \u2022 http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n\u2022 Justis \u2022 http://instagram.com/justis\n\u2022 Kenzo \u2022 http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\u2022 Josh \u2022 http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap\n\u2022 Arjun \u2022 http://instagram.com/badtothebone\n\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife/episodes...\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice-message!

                    "description": "It's a completely action packed episode today with two adrenaline pumping activities; bungee jumping in Whistler, and wake surfing at Deep Cove in North Vancouver. And coincidentally, we celebrated one of our good friends, Zachary Moxley.\n\nThe Sea To Sky Highway is an iconic and a must do for those who want to experience Vancouver. It just begins to scratch the surface of what British Columbia has to offer. The province is extremely vast, after all. \n\nWe found ourselves at Whistler to experience an incredible bungee jump (look at the location!), before hitting up a Mexican restaurant for some lunch. Be sure to see Zach scarf down that burrito. It's a hilarious sight. And to top off the day, we spent our time wake surfing down in Deep Cove! And of course we had to fit in some of those classic HoL backflips and gainers \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n---------------------\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO THE FOLLOWING:\n\u2022 Zach \u2022 http://instagram.com/downtofilm\n\u2022 Kyle \u2022 http://instagram.com/kyleslee\n\u2022 Jacob \u2022 http://instagram.com/jacobcrawfordfilm\n\n---------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\u2022 Parker \u2022 http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\u2022 Dan \u2022 http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n\u2022 Justis \u2022 http://instagram.com/justis\n\u2022 Kenzo \u2022 http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n\u2022 Josh \u2022 http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap\n\u2022 Arjun \u2022 http://instagram.com/badtothebone\n\n\u2022 Instagram \u2022 https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n\u2022 Facebook \u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\u2022 Twitter \u2022 https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nGET OUR PODCAST ON AUDIO:\nhttps://anchor.fm/highonlife/episodes...\n\nLEAVE US A VOICE MESSAGE:\nUse the Anchor app to leave us a voice-message!

We intend to share those videos.\n\nRyker and Alexey were that captains of this company but we have a team dedicated to continuing what they started many years ago. The current High On Life team consists of Parker, Justis, Kenzo, Josh, Ben, Leo and Arjun. There is also a team in Toronto lead by our close collaborator Dan Usher that consists of Sam Mantini, Blake Goulah and Jus There is also current a High On Life Toronto team lead by Dan Usher that consist of Sam Mantini, Blake Goulah and Justin Ferraccioli, while not mentioned in the video, they are very much unsung heros in helping us move forward and built the Jetsetterboss community over the last couple years.\n\nRyker had a tattoo that said 'Keep moving forward', Alexey had one that said \"Keep going\", and on behalf of the entire team, that's exactly what we intend to do.\n\nWe are so grateful for all the positive feedback, support, and encouragement we have received, especially for the past two months. Many of you have been with us since the beginning and we do not want to let you down.\n\nThank you all very much for all the support you have given us. Thank you for your patience through this difficult time. We want to get this engine back up and running as soon as we can and we would love to have you a part of it. \n\nHigh On Life will continue.\n\n---------------------------\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n- TWITTER https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\n---------------------------\n\nSOUNDTRACK:\n01 Direct - One Step Forward [MONSTERCAT]\n02 Laszlo - Closer [MONSTERCAT]"

This memorial fund will be dedicated to providing support for the families during this time. Specifically, going towards the celebration of life we will be having for these three amazing souls and helping cover any costs involved with their passing. We want the families of Ryker, Alexey, and Megan to focus on celebrating their lives and to not worry about any financial costs involved during this difficult time.\n\nThe GoFundMe will also be used to create a Legacy Fund in memory of everything that Alexey, Ryker, and Megan stood for. This fund will be established to support causes that align with the values and aspirations of Ryker, Alexey and Megan - empowering others to pursue their passions and dreams, and to live life to the fullest.\u00a0This is something that Ryker, Alexey, and Megan truly believed in - they wanted everyone to chase that voice burning inside of them and to get out there and live the life you\u2019ve always dreamed of. They truly believed anything is possible as long as you set your mind to it. \n\nIf you feel this is something you would like to be apart of please visit our GoFundMe link below:\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/ryker-alexey-amp-megan-memorial-fund\n\n-----\n\nOn July 3rd, 2018 we lost 3 very dear friends of ours, Ryker Gamble, Alexey Lyakh, and Megan Scraper. There are truly no words that can be said to ease the pain and the devastation that we are all going through right now. They were three of the warmest, kindest, most driven and outgoing people you could ever meet, and the world has lost a great deal of light from the passing of our friends. They lived every single day to it\u2019s fullest, they stood for positivity, courage, living the best life you can, and they shared and taught their values to millions or people worldwide. As tragic as their loss is, their message lives on through us all, and it is now our responsibility to keep the message going. \n\nSo in their honour, we'd like to share this passage, written by both Ryker and Alexey, to give us all the courage and motivation to strive for the best life we can have.\n\n\u201cWhat does it feel like to be present?

                    "description": "Use the #HOLInspired hashtag to share some of your inspirational messages.\n\nThe High On Life family has decided to setup a GoFundMe memorial fund in honour of Alexey, Ryker, and Megan. This memorial fund will be dedicated to providing support for the families during this time. Specifically, going towards the celebration of life we will be having for these three amazing souls and helping cover any costs involved with their passing. We want the families of Ryker, Alexey, and Megan to focus on celebrating their lives and to not worry about any financial costs involved during this difficult time.\n\nThe GoFundMe will also be used to create a Legacy Fund in memory of everything that Alexey, Ryker, and Megan stood for. This fund will be established to support causes that align with the values and aspirations of Ryker, Alexey and Megan - empowering others to pursue their passions and dreams, and to live life to the fullest.\u00a0This is something that Ryker, Alexey, and Megan truly believed in - they wanted everyone to chase that voice burning inside of them and to get out there and live the life you\u2019ve always dreamed of. They truly believed anything is possible as long as you set your mind to it. \n\nIf you feel this is something you would like to be apart of please visit our GoFundMe link below:\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/ryker-alexey-amp-megan-memorial-fund\n\n-----\n\nOn July 3rd, 2018 we lost 3 very dear friends of ours, Ryker Gamble, Alexey Lyakh, and Megan Scraper. There are truly no words that can be said to ease the pain and the devastation that we are all going through right now. They were three of the warmest, kindest, most driven and outgoing people you could ever meet, and the world has lost a great deal of light from the passing of our friends. They lived every single day to it\u2019s fullest, they stood for positivity, courage, living the best life you can, and they shared and taught their values to millions or people worldwide. As tragic as their loss is, their message lives on through us all, and it is now our responsibility to keep the message going. \n\nSo in their honour, we'd like to share this passage, written by both Ryker and Alexey, to give us all the courage and motivation to strive for the best life we can have.\n\n\u201cWhat does it feel like to be present? To be here in the now and fully experiencing this moment. Free from any weight of the past or any anticipation of the future. Just free. Free to realize that only you can control how you feel. About anything. Free to see things for what they are and free to give your time and energy to what really matters.

Over the course of 3 days, we had a dance competition on non-Newtonian fluid, a team assault water balloon fight on the beach, and hit a giant man-made slip n slide ramp into a lake where Nick Jonas threw pineapples at us that we had to try and catch. Everything was scored, and only 1 team walked away victorious.  We met a ton of new friends on this trip and had a such an epic time!\n\nCheckout more from the Malibu Games:  http://bit.ly/MalibuGames_HighOnLife\n\n--------------\n\nJoin our Private Facebook Community: http://bit.ly/2t7c0Yt\n\nFOLLOW AND SUBSCRIBE:\n\n- YOUTUBE https://bit.ly/2JmrwmW\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n- Dan http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n- Josh http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap",

Over the course of 3 days, we had a dance competition on non-Newtonian fluid, a team assault water balloon fight on the beach, and hit a giant man-made slip n slide ramp into a lake where Nick Jonas threw pineapples at us that we had to try and catch. Everything was scored, and only 1 team walked away victorious.  We met a ton of new friends on this trip and had a such an epic time!\n\nCheckout more from the Malibu Games:  http://bit.ly/MalibuGames_HighOnLife\n\n--------------\n\nJoin our Private Facebook Community: http://bit.ly/2t7c0Yt\n\nFOLLOW AND SUBSCRIBE:\n\n- YOUTUBE https://bit.ly/2JmrwmW\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n- Dan http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n- Josh http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap"

Justis reached out to a local clothing boutique here and in exchange for a few Instagram posts/stories on our accounts, they gave us a few of their clothing items! \n\nWith it being our last day, we have so many memories to look back on. It was a jam-packed two months, with new sights and sounds on the daily. We won't forget the wonderful people that we've met and the beautiful places that we've been. And although we're somewhat sad about having to leave beautiful Bali, who knows... we just be back for round two sometime soon!\n\n--------------\n\nA very special shoutout to Haze & Glory for hooking us up with their clothes!\nhttp://hazeandglory.com\nhttp://instagram.com/hazeandglory\n\n--------------\n\nJoin our Private Facebook Community: http://bit.ly/2t7c0Yt\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n- TWITTER https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Dan http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n- Josh http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap\n- Kenzo http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n- Justis http://instagram.com/justis"

We teamed up with Beth, Ash and Hazel to produce this incredible action sequence as the sun set on the Balinese coast. It was a picturesque time that our crew won't soon forget.\n\nWe've been on an 80s retrowave kick lately so we had to throw in the sexy synths and soaring saxophones on the soundtrack. Looking at that sunset... how could we NOT put something from the 80s on!\n\nComment your favourite part! And let us know who you think had the worst bail!\n\nSoundtrack:\nThe Midnight - Vampires (Instrumental)\n\nShoutout to our kickass biker girls!\nBeth: http://instagram.com/bethwalkemeyer\nAsh: http://instagram.com/ash_funchy\nHazel: http://instagram.com/hazelinanutshell\n\nJoin our Private Facebook Community: http://bit.ly/2t7c0Yt\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n- TWITTER https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Dan http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n- Josh http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap\n- Kenzo http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n- Justis http://instagram.com/justis"

Let us know down in the comments!\n\nHuge thanks to Nagisa-Bali for the incredible villas!\nhttp://www.nagisa-bali.com/\n\nHuge thanks to Cafe Moonlight Bali for the awesome lunch!\nhttp://cafemoonlightbali.com/\n\nJoin our Private Facebook Community: http://bit.ly/2t7c0Yt\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n- TWITTER https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Dan http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n- Kenzo http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n- Justis http://instagram.com/justis\n- Mindy http://instagram.com/mindy\n- Josh http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap"

In today's episode we get to find out what Justis and Kenzo were up to when we were away. It turns out that they had an awesome time travelling all over Bali.\n\nIn today's episode with the dynamic duo, follow them as the find their way to Bali's newest photo spot, a hidden waterfall known as the Tukad Cepung waterfall. It's an incredible place that you've got to trek to and get some truly epic photos. With god-level rays peeking through the falls and the mist, you're sure to get photos and videos that are going to pop off on Instagram.\n\nIn addition to the Tukad Cepung falls, we found ourself in some rice fields and experienced a truly stressful situation with Kenzo's drone. You might have previously seen Kenzo's drone problems, and today we see his drone's issues reach new heights (pun intended).\n\nSuch a huge thanks to @rachelsawden for being our guide for this trip!\n\nJoin our Private Facebook Community: http://bit.ly/2t7c0Yt\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n- TWITTER https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Dan http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n- Kenzo http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n- Justis http://instagram.com/justis\n- Josh http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap",

In today's episode we get to find out what Justis and Kenzo were up to when we were away. It turns out that they had an awesome time travelling all over Bali.\n\nIn today's episode with the dynamic duo, follow them as the find their way to Bali's newest photo spot, a hidden waterfall known as the Tukad Cepung waterfall. It's an incredible place that you've got to trek to and get some truly epic photos. With god-level rays peeking through the falls and the mist, you're sure to get photos and videos that are going to pop off on Instagram.\n\nIn addition to the Tukad Cepung falls, we found ourself in some rice fields and experienced a truly stressful situation with Kenzo's drone. You might have previously seen Kenzo's drone problems, and today we see his drone's issues reach new heights (pun intended).\n\nSuch a huge thanks to @rachelsawden for being our guide for this trip!\n\nJoin our Private Facebook Community: http://bit.ly/2t7c0Yt\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n- TWITTER https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Dan http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n- Kenzo http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n- Justis http://instagram.com/justis\n- Josh http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap"

Today is the FIRST DAY and we had so much fun. We split up into our teams and had to learn a dance that we were going to perform in pools of OOBLECK. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know what oobleck is, it\u2019s kind of a strange material that you sink into unless you\u2019re stepping on it constantly. It\u2019s a perfect substance to put a bunch of influencers in to have a dance off in.

Today is the FIRST DAY and we had so much fun. We split up into our teams and had to learn a dance that we were going to perform in pools of OOBLECK. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know what oobleck is, it\u2019s kind of a strange material that you sink into unless you\u2019re stepping on it constantly. It\u2019s a perfect substance to put a bunch of influencers in to have a dance off in. Check the footage out to see what we\u2019re talking about!\n\nThis is just day one and we had a ton of fun and made a lot of new friends so stay tuned for the coming days!\n\nJoin our Private Facebook Community: http://bit.ly/2t7c0Yt\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n- TWITTER https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Dan http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n- Josh http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap"

Some of the finest waves were surfed at Canggu. \n\nWe later spent the day searching for materials for our sunset beach play. Just a little game of coconut bowling is always a lot of fun for everyone. \n\nWe enjoyed making today's episode and we're looking forward to ramping up the content and the good times in the weeks to come!!!\n\nJoin our Private Facebook Community: http://bit.ly/2t7c0Yt\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n- TWITTER https://www.twitter.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Kenzo http://instagram.com/kenzokiren\n- Justis http://instagram.com/justiscooper\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Mindy http://instagram.com/mindy\n- Alissa http://instagram.com/alissa.hansen\n- Dan http://instagram.com/photosbyusher\n- Josh http://instagram.com/joshua.laplap\n- Justin http://instagram.com/ferrawho"

We expected 30-40 people and by the time we started there was close to 100 with standing room only! We had no idea that many people would turn out and we're interested to hear from us and learn how to build brands on social media.  Feedback was awesome, we made a ton of new friends, and added a lot of people into our Jetsetterboss community.

We expected 30-40 people and by the time we started there was close to 100 with standing room only! We had no idea that many people would turn out and we're interested to hear from us and learn how to build brands on social media.  Feedback was awesome, we made a ton of new friends, and added a lot of people into our Jetsetterboss community.

It's a maze of tunnels that lead into different openings and crevices... definitely a sweet hidden spot.  Iceland is also covered in over a hundred Volcanos, and we spent the afternoon hiking down into a cave that was created from moving lava. This is a tour where you can actually see both Ice and Lava!  Iceland has not let us down thus far... Expect to see 5 or 6 videos from this series!!\n\n\nFollow our homie Dan Usher!!

It's a maze of tunnels that lead into different openings and crevices... definitely a sweet hidden spot.  Iceland is also covered in over a hundred Volcanos, and we spent the afternoon hiking down into a cave that was created from moving lava. This is a tour where you can actually see both Ice and Lava!  Iceland has not let us down thus far... Expect to see 5 or 6 videos from this series!!\n\n\nFollow our homie Dan Usher!!

Most people can't do crazy flips into a pool overnight, but if you start small, build on what you learn, and practice, practice, practice, you'll get the hang of it and will be killing it on a trampoline, cliff jump, or diving board in no time! :)  \n\nIf you enjoyed this fun action vlog, leave us a comment and tell us what you liked most.

Some of these, we only got to experience for a day and others we spent over a week in... needless to say, the diversity of America is certainly what makes it so great (at least for us Canadians).  Feel free to roast us for our selection, we'd love to hear which cities you think are the best and why! Here are the Top 10 American Cities to visit!!\n\nSpecial city shout outs to Provo, Dallas, Kissimmee, North Carolina, and Mississippi! :P\n\nFOLLOW AND SUBSCRIBE:\n\n- YOUTUBE https://bit.ly/2JmrwmW\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\nSubscribe to our vlog channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/highonlifeSFZ\n\nSubscribe to our music channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/HighOnLifeSound"

I mean fully played out the scenario in your mind in all color and vivid detail?\n\nWhat would you do with it? Would you spend it on a house? Would you help out your family and loved ones, or invest it in a business? Would you go traveling in style or spend it on a flashy car? What would you really do with it and what would you be left with once it\u2019s all said and done?\n\nSo often we limit ourselves with the concept of money. If only I had a million dollars then I could do this or have that or live a certain way. Does money bring happiness? Sort of, it enables us to open our minds to the possibilities of life and it validates our current beliefs about happiness. But is it that flashy car that makes you happy or is it the experience of driving along the coast and laughing with your friends? Is it the first class flight and 5 star hotel, or is it the sand on your feet and salt in your hair? Is it the act of handing your mother a key to a new house or is it her reaction and tears of joy when you remind her that you love her?\n\nIt\u2019s not money and the material objects we buy with it that make us truly happy. There are many miserable millionaires and there are many more enlightened monks with no possessions at all. Happiness comes from within and it stems from experiences. Happiness is a conscious choice to enjoy life\u2019s gifts. You do not need to own a yacht or a jet plane to have the experiences they enable you to feel.\n\nSo forget about the money, focus on doing what you love, what makes you happy, what makes your loved ones happy. You cannot buy fulfillment. When you can open your mind to the possibilities of life and stop limiting yourself with the concept of money you will find freedom. And when you find freedom and rise above the limitations of money it will come to you anyways as the universe will help you on your path.\"\n\n\nJoin our Behind the Scenes News Letter: http://eepurl.com/bPz9WX\n\nCheck out our similar Blogs and Videos:\nHow to Travel for a Living - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF4u2AePy6c\nHow to Travel with no Money - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moOosWuoDyA\nHow to save 10k in 1 Year - http://sundayfundayz.com/how-to-save-10k-in-1-year/\nMoney Tips to Travel Longer - http://sundayfundayz.com/8-money-savvy-tips-to-help-you-travel-longer/\n\nFOLLOW and SUBSCRIBE for more:\n\nSNAPCHAT: @sundayfundayz\nLike: https://www.facebook.com/sundayfundayz\nFollow: http://twitter.com/sundayfundayz\nInsta: http://instagram.com/highonlifeco\nVine: https://vine.co/sundayfundayz\nPics: https://www.flickr.com/photos/sundayfundayz/sets\nBlog: http://sundayfundayz.com/\nMerch: http://highonlife.co/\n\n\nSubscribe to our Music channel: https://www.youtube.com/HighOnLifeSound\nSubscribe to our Vlog channel: https://www.youtube.com/highonlifesfz\n\nTrack: Pinguin - Transitional State",

Moral of the story, thieves come in all different shapes and sizes, and sometimes use very unique methods to get the goods that they're after.

This was a very tough video to make, but hopefully after sharing the experience with you guys, it will stop this from happening to someone else.  Moral of the story, thieves come in all different shapes and sizes, and sometimes use very unique methods to get the goods that they're after.  Travel smart, travel safe, and don't forget the pocket pat down!!!\n\n\nFOLLOW US and SUBSCRIBE for more:\n\nSNAPCHAT: @sundayfundayz\nLike: https://www.facebook.com/sundayfundayz\nFollow: http://twitter.com/sundayfundayz\nInsta: http://instagram.com/highonlifeco\nVine: https://vine.co/sundayfundayz\nPics: https://www.flickr.com/photos/sundayfundayz\nBlog: http://sundayfundayz.com/\nMerch: http://highonlife.co/\n\nSubscribe to our vlog channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/highonlifeSFZ\n\nSubscribe to our music channel: https://www.youtube.com/HighOnLifeSound"

We met dozens of people while traveling that just seemed to have it figured out.  They would either have a job they could do remotely or would work in the country they were visiting.  These people would work, travel, work, travel, and repeat and repeat and repeat... it got us really excited and so we learned about this lifestyle a bit more.  \n\nHopefully after watching the video you'll have a better idea of how it works, and will start planning your next adventure! :D\n\nFOLLOW AND SUBSCRIBE for MORE:\n\n- YOUTUBE https://bit.ly/2JmrwmW\n- INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/Highonlife\n- FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/Sundayfundayz\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS:\n\n- Ryker http://instagram.com/rykergamble\n- Rush http://instagram.com/wanderlust\n- Parker http://instagram.com/parkerheuser\n\n\nCheck out our similar Blogs and Videos:\nHow to Travel for a Living - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF4u2...\nHow to Travel with no Money - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moOos...\nHow to save 10k in 1 Year - http://sundayfundayz.com/how-to-save-...\nMoney Tips to Travel Longer - http://sundayfundayz.com/8-money-savv...\n\nFOLLOW US and SUBSCRIBE for more:\n\nSNAPCHAT: @sundayfundayz\nLike: https://www.facebook.com/sundayfundayz\nFollow: http://twitter.com/sundayfundayz\nInsta: http://instagram.com/highonlifeco\nVine: https://vine.co/sundayfundayz\nPics: https://www.flickr.com/photos/sundayf...\nBlog: http://sundayfundayz.com/\nMerch: http://highonlife.co/\n\nSubscribe to our vlog channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/highonlifeSFZ\n\nSubscribe to our music channel: https://www.youtube.com/HighOnLifeSound"

Not to mention doing it on a surreal Caribbean beach in St Maarten with turquoise waters! From zip lining through a rain forest, to feeding wild monkeys, to cooking Johnny Cakes with Ms Moore, to racing Olympic size yachts, and finally getting towed behind an ATV on a skimboard... this episode screams adventure!

                "description": "Recent Death at this location (March 27th, 2016): http://bit.ly/1UygaPc\nATTENTION EVERYONE WATCHING THIS VIDEO:  Our team has been trained and involved in gymnastics, diving, stunts, and the extreme sports community for over a decade.  We take many precautions when assessing safe diving spots, including checking water levels, water currents, height measurements, etc, and always have locals and professionals alongside with us when embarking on these epic cliff jumping missions.  As much fun as it can be, it is also EXTREMELY dangerous.  There have been several accidents and even deaths at this location, and we DO NOT condone others to try and attempt the same things we've done.  Please take this message seriously, because as popular as this place has become, it is not worth getting injured or witnessing a friend get injured and need rescuing. \n\n*    *    *   \n\nOnly 30 minute drive from downtown Vancouver is home to this amazing and epic place that has a natural water slide that turns into a waterfall and has a vast variety of epic cliff jumping spots. It's extremely dangerous because of water levels and currents, and is also pretty chilly even in the peak of summer. \n\nCheck out more of Epic Action Videos: https://youtu.be/AqS750N8Ou8?list=PL3...\n\nBlog: http://sundayfundayz.com/\nMerch: http://highonlife.co/\nLike: https://www.facebook.com/sundayfundayz\nFollow: http://twitter.com/sundayfundayz\nInsta: http://instagram.com/highonlifeco\nVine: https://vine.co/sundayfundayz\nPics: https://www.flickr.com/photos/sundayf...\n\nLike the music?

We take many precautions when assessing safe diving spots, including checking water levels, water currents, height measurements, etc, and always have locals and professionals alongside with us when embarking on these epic cliff jumping missions.  As much fun as it can be, it is also EXTREMELY dangerous.  There have been several accidents and even deaths at this location, and we DO NOT condone others to try and attempt the same things we've done.  Please take this message seriously, because as popular as this place has become, it is not worth getting injured or witnessing a friend get injured and need rescuing. \n\n*    *    *   \n\nOnly 30 minute drive from downtown Vancouver is home to this amazing and epic place that has a natural water slide that turns into a waterfall and has a vast variety of epic cliff jumping spots. It's extremely dangerous because of water levels and currents, and is also pretty chilly even in the peak of summer. \n\nCheck out more of Epic Action Videos: https://youtu.be/AqS750N8Ou8?list=PL3...\n\nBlog: http://sundayfundayz.com/\nMerch: http://highonlife.co/\nLike: https://www.facebook.com/sundayfundayz\nFollow: http://twitter.com/sundayfundayz\nInsta: http://instagram.com/highonlifeco\nVine: https://vine.co/sundayfundayz\nPics: https://www.flickr.com/photos/sundayf...\n\nLike the music?

The words are just a verbal description of an internal sensation. It is a sense of heightened perceptions. I can best describe it as a feeling of internal glow radiating outwards onto the world from within. It's the feeling that you get when you go skydiving, after the initial rush as you're safely coasting to the ground. It's a feeling of presence of nowness. Of accepting and fully enjoying the present moment. Being in the flow. In a current of inspiration.  It's a feeling of watching the sunrise in a foreign country. It's the butterflies you get when you meet a beautiful girl and share a connection, a spark. It's a feeling of serenity and peace, a heightened sense of awareness. It's a vibration of gratitude and love. A knowing that you are doing exactly what you are meant to be doing in this place and time. A sense of freedom. An appreciation of beauty.\n\nFor me it's the powerful emotion of these combined sensations.
