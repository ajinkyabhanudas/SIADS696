In addition, poachers also target antelopes and other endangered species such as wild dogs and cheetah for their meat and skin.\n\nIn order to combat this problem, Transfrontier Africa founded the Black Mamba Anti-Poaching Unit to protect the Olifants West Region of Balule Nature Reserve, one of Africa's largest game reserves. \n\nThe Black Mambas is an unarmed and all-female group, trained to spot, track down and arrest poachers. They are all between 20 and 30 years old and come from local communities and villages surrounding the reserve. So far, The Black Mambas have found and taken down over 12 poachers' camps and 3 bush meat kitchens while also reducing snaring and poisoning by 76% in the area, proving more effective than drones or thermal optics. \n\nBut The Black Mambas Program does more than just protect endangered wildlife. It also creates bonds within local communities and educates them about the animals and the importance of saving their natural heritage. The group's goal is to win the war on poaching not through violence, but through local communities being able to work together.\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Paige Keipper (Hansen)\nCinematographer: Morgana Wingard\nEditor: Jordan Dertinger",

Bird didn't have expertise to rely on, but he did have the powerful inspiration of his late father, who died at sea in 1996 while also rowing the North Pacific. \n\nBird only got five precious years with his father and he hoped this journey would bring him some closure on his passing.

Bird didn't have expertise to rely on, but he did have the powerful inspiration of his late father, who died at sea in 1996 while also rowing the North Pacific. \n\nBird only got five precious years with his father and he hoped this journey would bring him some closure on his passing. His father, Peter Bird, was also the first man to row the Pacific Ocean solo in 1983.\n\nWatch today's Seeker Stories video to see footage from Bird's incredible adventure and find out if he was able to gain solace from this unique experience.\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Paige Keipper (Hansen)\nCinematographer: Spencer Snider, Alex Gerhard\nEditor: Jordan Dertinger"

One of the entertainment company's most formidable shows is K\u00c0, which has been running since 2004 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nCirque du Soleil recruits top artists from around the world to audition and perform in their shows. Artists compete for highly coveted positions and for many, it is their dream to be on the stage in a Cirque du Soleil production.\n\nFor a production of K\u00c0, there are 14 acts, 80 artists, and over 300 people working behind the scenes. The Los Angeles Times called it the most technologically advanced show in Western theater, incorporating hydraulics, moving stages, pyrotechnics, and more. Seeker Stories correspondent Laura Ling went backstage to interview five artists from the cast. What kind of rituals did each artist use to prepare and remain focused for such advanced, breath-taking stunts?\n\nAll of the artists have their own way of preparing mentally, physically, and emotionally to go on stage. For artist Noriko Takahashi, who uses a baton in may of her scenes, practice is essential - even after performing in the show for 11 years. \"If I can trust myself,\" she explains, \"I feel more free on the stage. It makes my performance better.\"\n\nFor other performers, it is important to connect the mind with the body through various exercises. \"I do skipping rope and I do all sorts of juggling,\" said capoeira artist Gabryel Nogueira da Silva. With as complex of a production as K\u00c0, it's also important to connect with other members of the cast. \"When there's other people warming up in the same room as me, I try to play with them. I think that's my main goal of the ritual. It is to be connected to the other people that are around me so we can deliver the final result together.\" \n\nOne of the audience's favorite acts, which features the Wheel of Death, takes immense preparation and focus for it's star performers, the Alegr\u00eda brothers, Francisco and Sabu.\n\n\"My brother and I, we are not attached to any safety because you have to be free to be able to really perform. Anything can happen in blink of an eye,\" said Francisco. So the brothers often play football, or soccer, with each other and other cast members in order to get their adrenaline running. \"Every movement is like the wheel,\" said Sabu. \"You run and sometimes, you need to react quickly.\"\n\nDan Hong Li, a Chinese opera artist, approaches her warm-up very differently. For her, the important goal is to become calm and focused. Her main ritual involves breathing exercises in the training room before a performance. \"Tai Chi gives me a clear mind and positive energy,\" she explained. Entering into character is also an important step. \"When I do my makeup, I just totally, completely relax and focus. I think it's very important.\"\n\nThe cast of K\u00c0 perform the show ten times a week, and even on their days off, they spend many hours conditioning their bodies, eating a focused diet, and concentrating on their routine. It is a lot of hard work, which some of the performers have been doing all of their lives. \n\nFrancisco and Sabu Alegr\u00eda have been in the business for nearly 30 years, and know that staying on top of their craft and remaining dedicated to their work is paramount to safety. \"When you want to do something, you have to take it seriously. If you really want to learn,\" said Francisco, \"You have to be disciplined.\"\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Paige Keipper (Hansen)\nCinematographers: Matthew Piniol, Spencer Snider\nEditor: Jordan Dertinger",

It is a lot of hard work, which some of the performers have been doing all of their lives. \n\nFrancisco and Sabu Alegr\u00eda have been in the business for nearly 30 years, and know that staying on top of their craft and remaining dedicated to their work is paramount to safety. \"When you want to do something, you have to take it seriously.

It covers 70% of our planet, dictates weather, regulates temperature, and takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. On the ocean floor lies one of the most diverse marine ecosystems in the world: coral reefs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other ecosystem on this planet that occupies such a small geographic area, but has more forms of life than coral reef ecosystems. They\u2019re unprecedented,\u201d Dr. Jamie Gove, a research oceanographer at NOAA, told Seeker\u2019s correspondent, Kyle Thiermann. \u00a0\u201cOne in four of all marine organisms live in association with coral reefs, but they occupy less than one-tenth of 1% of the seafloor.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlthough known for their beautiful appearance, the reefs are vital to humans and marine life alike. Life without coral reefs would likely mean millions of species dying. It would also mean losing reefs as a new source for medical research, which in the past has led to new medications that treat cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s, and many other conditions.\n\u00a0\nAs much as coral reefs provide for the planet, they are very delicate, and reefs around the world are currently dying off at an alarming rate.\u00a0Coral bleaching occurs in high water temperatures and affects the coral\u2019s zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae are photosynthetic algae that live within the issue of coral polyp and give healthy coral a bright color, as well as nutrients. When the water becomes too hot, the coral expel the zooxanthellae. At this point, the coral are not dead, but they\u2019re vulnerable.\n\u00a0\nThere have been many incidents recently that have decimated coral, like in 1998 when El Nino triggered a bleaching event that killed 16% of coral reefs around the world. A similar event happened during La Nina of 2010, and again in October of 2015. This event is ongoing and has become the longest bleaching event in recorded history.\n\u00a0\nWith time and reduced climate intensity, bleached reefs can come back to life, but it\u2019s much harder when they are additionally stressed by land based activities.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think we have seen declines in reef ecosystems for decades now and so I think that we\u2019re slowly reaching a tipping point which once we reach that point, reefs will be on a negative trajectory that there\u2019s no turning back,\u201d said Dr. Gove. \u201cThe only way that we can promote reef ecosystem resilience is by changing what we\u2019re doing on land, that currently impacts reef ecosystem health.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOne of these factors are the feral pigs and goats in Hawaii. Chad Wiggins, Marine Program Director at The Nature Conservancy Hawaii, is working towards solutions to manage the hooved animals\u2019 growing population numbers, and in effect, hopefully provide relief for coral to survive the effects of climate change.\n\u00a0\nFeral pigs and goats cause damage for coral as they dig up grounds in search for worms and snails in Hawaii\u2019s forests, and that\u2019s where the problem begins.\u201cOnce the rains come intermittently and flood these streams, that\u2019s when they get a big bolster of sediment onto the reef,\u201d explained Wiggins. \u201cIf it\u2019s smothered, it can\u2019t get sunlight, it can\u2019t get oxygen, it can\u2019t get nutrients and it\u2019s dead. \u00a0If the coral manages to survive, every time the waves come it gets re-suspended and the sediment continues to do damage, sometimes for decades.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNative residents of Hawaii, like Pono Hiu, feel very protective of both coral and feral pigs. Approximately 500 million people depend on reefs for food to feed their families. Reefs also support livelihoods by contributing $30 billion to the global economy each year through fishing, recreation, and tourism.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt would be a sad day to jump into this ocean and not see any coral for me. I take my son out here and I dive all the time and poke fish to feed my family. This ocean provides food for a lot of us here in Hawaii,\u201d said Hiu.\n\u00a0\nHiu and his family have lived in Hawaii for generations, and are also eager to find solutions where pigs and coral can coexist.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat needs to happen is management,\u201d said Wiggins. \u201cIf we want to have a healthy native forest, there have to be some areas that don\u2019t have pigs in them and finding where those areas are is something where conservationists and hunters have to work together.\u201d\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Paige Keipper (Hansen)\nCinematographer: Spencer Snider\nEditor: Jordan Dertinger",

Reefs also support livelihoods by contributing $30 billion to the global economy each year through fishing, recreation, and tourism.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt would be a sad day to jump into this ocean and not see any coral for me. I take my son out here and I dive all the time and poke fish to feed my family. This ocean provides food for a lot of us here in Hawaii,\u201d said Hiu.\n\u00a0\nHiu and his family have lived in Hawaii for generations, and are also eager to find solutions where pigs and coral can coexist.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat needs to happen is management,\u201d said Wiggins. \u201cIf we want to have a healthy native forest, there have to be some areas that don\u2019t have pigs in them and finding where those areas are is something where conservationists and hunters have to work together.\u201d\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Paige Keipper (Hansen)\nCinematographer: Spencer Snider\nEditor: Jordan Dertinger"

                "description": "Watch the next video to learn more about the science of algae fuel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExOXF1x3N1g\nSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/c/seekerstories?sub_confirmation=1\n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp - iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp - Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nGreat strides have been made in recent years towards using renewable sources of energy, like electric vehicles, solar panels, wind energy and even algae. It might seem surprising, but algae is one of the most powerful sources of energy we have access to on Earth. When dried algae is ground into a powder and refined, oil can be extracted from it. The result is nearly identical to traditional gasoline, but with far more benefits. \n\nDave Hazlebeck, CEO of Global Algae Innovations, gave Seeker a tour of his algae farm in Kauai, Hawaii, and explained how his company is revolutionizing sustainable energy. \"The fuel that we're producing is exactly the same in terms of performance as gasoline or diesel or jet, it's just a lot cleaner. I think the big difference is that [with] all the other biofuels, you're growing it and you're just getting biofuel. In this case, for every gallon of biofuel you get 10 pounds of food with it,\" Hazlebeck said.\n\nHazlebeck believes his company is on the path to completely change the way we currently produce both oil and food. Not only can algae create biofuel, it can also be used to create animal feed. Currently, most animal and fish feed is made from corn or soy, which both use more water and energy to grow than algae.\n\n\"There's studies that show with algae grown to replace animal feed, you could actually solve global warming to a large extent,\" Hazlebeck told Seeker.\n\nAlgae can be used to create food for humans as well. New Wave Foods in Northern California created fake shrimp made from algae and other plants that actually looks, smells and even tastes like real shrimp. Because it's made from algae, the shrimp substitute also has the added benefit of being low in fat and extremely rich in nutrients, something that corn and soy are severely lacking.\n\nGrowing algae for oil and food could also significantly reduce deforestation. According to Scientific American, the yields from algae are far more significant than crops like corn or soy. If all the fuel in the country was replaced with biofuel from corn, we would need a facility three times the size of the continental U.S. to produce it. But for algae, we would need a facility the size of Maryland. Additionally, algae can produce 40 times more food per acre than traditional crops. \n\nWhile showing the Seeker team around GAI's Hawaii facility, Hazlebeck explained that the algae farm is next to a power plant, which puts it in a very unique position. \"[It] allows us to capture carbon dioxide and avoid that discharge and reuse it, and that prevents it from going into the atmosphere and causing global warming,\" he said. \"If every power plant had an algae farm next to it, it could potentially solve the global warming issue entirely.\"\n\nThe environmental benefits of algae are impressive, and because algae can grow in both freshwater and seawater, it's also very easy to produce. So, does that mean we'll all be filling our cars with algae gas at the pumps very soon?\n\nNot just yet. Hazlebeck and his team have run into a few setbacks since they began scaling up their operations. The most prohibitive issue has been the cost.\n\nWhen Global Algae Innovations began, a gallon of oil produced from algae was about $30 a gallon -- 10 times higher than it needs to be to work as a viable alternative to fossil fuel. But Hazlebeck and his team didn't give up, and they've continued to come up with solutions to decrease the cost. As of now, they almost have algae oil down to only $2 - $3 a gallon.\n\nOnce GAI can get their algae production up to scale, Hazlebeck believes it will change the geopolitics of the world. \"A lot of the reasons we have wars are because of fights over resources or the need for more resources. By creating a more equitable distribution with countries being able to make their own, it should lead to a more stable and peaceful world,\" he told Seeker.\n\nThat's really the point of it all for Hazlebeck and GAI. They don't want to be the only company doing this; they want everyone working together because they truly believe using algae as a fuel and food source will change the world.\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducers: Paige Keipper (Hansen), Conor Spicer\nCinematographers: Matthew Piniol Spencer Snider\nEditor: Lee Mould",

                    "description": "Watch the next video to learn more about the science of algae fuel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExOXF1x3N1g\nSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/c/seekerstories?sub_confirmation=1\n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp - iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp - Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nGreat strides have been made in recent years towards using renewable sources of energy, like electric vehicles, solar panels, wind energy and even algae. It might seem surprising, but algae is one of the most powerful sources of energy we have access to on Earth. When dried algae is ground into a powder and refined, oil can be extracted from it. The result is nearly identical to traditional gasoline, but with far more benefits. \n\nDave Hazlebeck, CEO of Global Algae Innovations, gave Seeker a tour of his algae farm in Kauai, Hawaii, and explained how his company is revolutionizing sustainable energy. \"The fuel that we're producing is exactly the same in terms of performance as gasoline or diesel or jet, it's just a lot cleaner. I think the big difference is that [with] all the other biofuels, you're growing it and you're just getting biofuel. In this case, for every gallon of biofuel you get 10 pounds of food with it,\" Hazlebeck said.\n\nHazlebeck believes his company is on the path to completely change the way we currently produce both oil and food. Not only can algae create biofuel, it can also be used to create animal feed. Currently, most animal and fish feed is made from corn or soy, which both use more water and energy to grow than algae.\n\n\"There's studies that show with algae grown to replace animal feed, you could actually solve global warming to a large extent,\" Hazlebeck told Seeker.\n\nAlgae can be used to create food for humans as well. New Wave Foods in Northern California created fake shrimp made from algae and other plants that actually looks, smells and even tastes like real shrimp. Because it's made from algae, the shrimp substitute also has the added benefit of being low in fat and extremely rich in nutrients, something that corn and soy are severely lacking.\n\nGrowing algae for oil and food could also significantly reduce deforestation. According to Scientific American, the yields from algae are far more significant than crops like corn or soy. If all the fuel in the country was replaced with biofuel from corn, we would need a facility three times the size of the continental U.S. to produce it. But for algae, we would need a facility the size of Maryland. Additionally, algae can produce 40 times more food per acre than traditional crops. \n\nWhile showing the Seeker team around GAI's Hawaii facility, Hazlebeck explained that the algae farm is next to a power plant, which puts it in a very unique position. \"[It] allows us to capture carbon dioxide and avoid that discharge and reuse it, and that prevents it from going into the atmosphere and causing global warming,\" he said. \"If every power plant had an algae farm next to it, it could potentially solve the global warming issue entirely.\"\n\nThe environmental benefits of algae are impressive, and because algae can grow in both freshwater and seawater, it's also very easy to produce. So, does that mean we'll all be filling our cars with algae gas at the pumps very soon?\n\nNot just yet. Hazlebeck and his team have run into a few setbacks since they began scaling up their operations. The most prohibitive issue has been the cost.\n\nWhen Global Algae Innovations began, a gallon of oil produced from algae was about $30 a gallon -- 10 times higher than it needs to be to work as a viable alternative to fossil fuel. But Hazlebeck and his team didn't give up, and they've continued to come up with solutions to decrease the cost. As of now, they almost have algae oil down to only $2 - $3 a gallon.\n\nOnce GAI can get their algae production up to scale, Hazlebeck believes it will change the geopolitics of the world. \"A lot of the reasons we have wars are because of fights over resources or the need for more resources. By creating a more equitable distribution with countries being able to make their own, it should lead to a more stable and peaceful world,\" he told Seeker.\n\nThat's really the point of it all for Hazlebeck and GAI. They don't want to be the only company doing this; they want everyone working together because they truly believe using algae as a fuel and food source will change the world.\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducers: Paige Keipper (Hansen), Conor Spicer\nCinematographers: Matthew Piniol Spencer Snider\nEditor: Lee Mould"

New Wave has been working on a shrimp substitute that's made entirely from plant and algae products. \n\nThe company was founded by two scientists, Dominique Barnes and Michelle Wolf, who wanted to come up with a more sustainable alternative to shrimp farming. Shrimp farms across Asia often destroy mangrove forests and wetland ecosystems - a high price to pay for the number one eaten seafood in the U.S. The average American consumes 4 pounds of shrimp per year - adding to a total of 1.3 billion pounds consumed annually. New Wave's plant-based shrimp looks a lot like the real thing, and even has the texture and taste of shrimp, with similar fat and protein content, but no cholesterol. \n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp - iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp - Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Pam Torno\nCinematographers: Matthew Piniol, Spencer Snider\nEditor: Lee Mould",

New Wave has been working on a shrimp substitute that's made entirely from plant and algae products. \n\nThe company was founded by two scientists, Dominique Barnes and Michelle Wolf, who wanted to come up with a more sustainable alternative to shrimp farming. Shrimp farms across Asia often destroy mangrove forests and wetland ecosystems - a high price to pay for the number one eaten seafood in the U.S. The average American consumes 4 pounds of shrimp per year - adding to a total of 1.3 billion pounds consumed annually. New Wave's plant-based shrimp looks a lot like the real thing, and even has the texture and taste of shrimp, with similar fat and protein content, but no cholesterol. \n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp - iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp - Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Pam Torno\nCinematographers: Matthew Piniol, Spencer Snider\nEditor: Lee Mould"

That means most of our solid waste goes to landfills and incinerators - including recyclable items like paper, glass, metal and plastic. Massive amounts of food waste that can be composted is clogging landfills, creating dangerous greenhouse gases. Many cities are starting to tackle this problem by implementing policies to help curb the waste by recycling and composting more. It's known as the \"zero waste\" movement, and San Francisco is on the forefront. Other cities that have zero waste goals include Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, Austin, and Oakland. But San Francisco has been the most aggressive. In 2009 the board of supervisors passed an ordinance requiring all residents and business to recycle and compost their waste, making it the first American city to make composting mandatory. Its goal is to achieve zero waste by 2020, and it has diverted 80% of its waste from landfills so far. Now the city is getting attention from all around the world. Government officials from China, Italy, France, Denmark, India and many other countries have visited San Francisco's state of the art recycling and composting facilities in hopes of learning how to replicate its success.\n\nFor more on San Francisco's Zero Waste plan: http://sfenvironment.org/zero-waste\n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp \u2014 iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp \u2014 Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Pam Torno\nCinematographers: Matthew Piniol, Spencer Snider\nEditor: Lee Mould",

That means most of our solid waste goes to landfills and incinerators - including recyclable items like paper, glass, metal and plastic. Massive amounts of food waste that can be composted is clogging landfills, creating dangerous greenhouse gases. Many cities are starting to tackle this problem by implementing policies to help curb the waste by recycling and composting more. It's known as the \"zero waste\" movement, and San Francisco is on the forefront. Other cities that have zero waste goals include Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, Austin, and Oakland. But San Francisco has been the most aggressive. In 2009 the board of supervisors passed an ordinance requiring all residents and business to recycle and compost their waste, making it the first American city to make composting mandatory. Its goal is to achieve zero waste by 2020, and it has diverted 80% of its waste from landfills so far. Now the city is getting attention from all around the world. Government officials from China, Italy, France, Denmark, India and many other countries have visited San Francisco's state of the art recycling and composting facilities in hopes of learning how to replicate its success.\n\nFor more on San Francisco's Zero Waste plan: http://sfenvironment.org/zero-waste\n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp \u2014 iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp \u2014 Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Pam Torno\nCinematographers: Matthew Piniol, Spencer Snider\nEditor: Lee Mould"

The show has been filmed in various locations across Europe, including Ireland, Iceland, Croatia, Morocco, and Spain, resulting in a huge boost in tourism. But no town has needed this boost more than Osuna, a tiny Spanish village in the Andalusian region, where the unemployment rate is over 30%. In 2014, film crews for Game of Thrones descended upon Osuna for just 17 days of shooting. The producers were attracted by Osuna's bullring, which was used to film the Daznak's Pit scene from Season 5. Since then, the town has experienced a noticeable increase in visitors - mostly fans of the series.

When she arrives, she takes over for crossing guard duty and welcomes each student on their way to school for the day. It\u2019s just one of the ways she has taken a hands-on approach to turning around a flailing school district in a low-income neighborhood near Ferguson, Missouri.

Memes are so much a part of our online lives that we forget how much they've changed over the brief course of Internet history. But they can go in and out of style so fast that it's hard to keep up. That's where Tumblr content & community associate Amanda Brennan comes in. She's made a career out of documenting and archiving these viral and ephemeral bits of pop culture. Amanda can tell you exactly how a particular meme got started, when it reached its peak, and when it died and/or came back. \"It's so important right now to be archiving this stuff because meme culture is really rapidly growing and it represents what's going on, on the outskirts of pop culture,\" Amanda says. The word \"meme\" was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who used the term to describe a cultural idea that travels from person to person and changes each time. Some pre-Internet examples include the Star Wars opening crawl, which has been spoofed since the late 70s, and \"Kilroy Was Here\" - a drawing made by World War II soldiers. These days Internet memes can take many forms - hashtags, songs, emoticons, Vines or GIF sets. A meme can teach us about communities and change the way we communicate. According to Amanda, \"It's a way to sometimes work through hard stuff. It adds more nuance to speech and interaction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin the Seeker community!\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\r\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\r\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \r\nApp - iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\r\nApp - Android http://seekernetwork.com/android",

This is the island's cultural and economic heart, a lively crucible of music and politics. Like a plate of spicy jerk washed down with a cold Red Stripe beer, a visit to Kingston is essential to taste the rich excitement of modern Jamaica.\"\n\n10 Things to Do in Kingston\nThe Culture Trip - http://theculturetrip.com/caribbean/jamaica/articles/10-things-to-do-in-kingston/\n\"Home to half of Jamaica's 2.7 million people, Kingston is a growing metropolis surrounded by mountains in the north and coastline to the south. Like any major city, its neighborhoods vacillate between socioeconomic extremes, and while some areas have earned a reputation for violence, Kingston is well worth a visit. While you're there, you'll notice that the sometimes tough environment still provides a major source of inspiration to many Jamaican artists, musicians, writers, and athletes.\"",

This is the island's cultural and economic heart, a lively crucible of music and politics. Like a plate of spicy jerk washed down with a cold Red Stripe beer, a visit to Kingston is essential to taste the rich excitement of modern Jamaica.\"\n\n10 Things to Do in Kingston\nThe Culture Trip - http://theculturetrip.com/caribbean/jamaica/articles/10-things-to-do-in-kingston/\n\"Home to half of Jamaica's 2.7 million people, Kingston is a growing metropolis surrounded by mountains in the north and coastline to the south. Like any major city, its neighborhoods vacillate between socioeconomic extremes, and while some areas have earned a reputation for violence, Kingston is well worth a visit. While you're there, you'll notice that the sometimes tough environment still provides a major source of inspiration to many Jamaican artists, musicians, writers, and athletes.\""

Pew's latest study shows that 80% of online daters in the U.S. think it's a good way to meet someone. And 62% say it helps them find better matches.\r\n\r\n \"The thing about technology is, it's there, we have to deal with it,\" Steve said. \"If you were traveling from New York to Los Angeles, would you go in a covered wagon? That's the same theory I have for dating.  You use the technology that's available now.\""

Forbes called him \u201cthe busiest man on the internet\u201d \u2014 once he has an idea, he goes for it. And Hwang has had a lot of ideas.\n\nOne such idea came up during a conversation with a friend one day. \u201cWe were talking about field trips that we had gone on in high school,\u201d says Hwang.  \u201cAnd [my friend] was like, \u2018Oh, did you ever go to a nuclear plant?\u2019  And I was like, \u2018What high school do you go to that you went into a nuclear plant for your high school field trip?\u2019\u201d  \n\nFrom there, Hwang was determined to find out how to do such a tour again today. However, after making the call and explaining that he was just an enthusiastic admirer and wanted to check out the nuclear power plant, he was politely told no.\n\nAfter going back to the drawing board, Tim came up with a plan. He created a Tumblr site for his new group, named the Bay Area Infrastructure Observatory. Then he decided he needed an official sounding title for himself \u2014 Deputy Director. \n\n\u201cA big organization, it\u2019s not just numbers, there has to be people who actually have offices with mahogany desks and lots of people reporting to them and that kind of thing,\u201d Hwang explains. \u201cBut you have to know with organizations that the president never calls you, right?  If it\u2019s an important enough organization, it\u2019s always got to be his assistant, so my official title is Deputy Director; there currently is no director.\u201d\n\nWhy the keen interest in visiting a power plant? Or, for that matter, any of the sites that the Bay Area Infrastructure Observatory have visited, which include The National Ignition Facility, a container terminal, or the newly constructed San Francisco Bay Bridge extension? \n\n\u201dI think we live in an environment nowadays which is kind of very restricted as to what you can see and really, what you can learn about,\u201d Hwang says. \n\n\u201cEverything from the design of a chair to the setting of the size of a bike lane, these are all choices that ultimately, people make.  And I think it\u2019s really inspirational that people are willing to kind of struggle to make that thing happen because no matter how small, it actually has a really big impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very much just about, \u201cHey, these places are really cool.  It\u2019d be great to learn more about them and it\u2019s weird that we don\u2019t know more about them.\u201d\n\n*Note: Sutro Tower is not open for public tours.

                    "description": "Watch the next video about people living in the hidden tunnels of Las Vegas : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk&index=4&list=PLRX7cVaoYVM7ZQFF6QTrYdhj_z2phxWNJ\nSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/c/seekerstories?sub_confirmation=1\n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp \u2014 iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp \u2014 Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nChances are you have not met someone like Tim Hwang before. Forbes called him \u201cthe busiest man on the internet\u201d \u2014 once he has an idea, he goes for it. And Hwang has had a lot of ideas.\n\nOne such idea came up during a conversation with a friend one day. \u201cWe were talking about field trips that we had gone on in high school,\u201d says Hwang.  \u201cAnd [my friend] was like, \u2018Oh, did you ever go to a nuclear plant?\u2019  And I was like, \u2018What high school do you go to that you went into a nuclear plant for your high school field trip?\u2019\u201d  \n\nFrom there, Hwang was determined to find out how to do such a tour again today. However, after making the call and explaining that he was just an enthusiastic admirer and wanted to check out the nuclear power plant, he was politely told no.\n\nAfter going back to the drawing board, Tim came up with a plan. He created a Tumblr site for his new group, named the Bay Area Infrastructure Observatory. Then he decided he needed an official sounding title for himself \u2014 Deputy Director. \n\n\u201cA big organization, it\u2019s not just numbers, there has to be people who actually have offices with mahogany desks and lots of people reporting to them and that kind of thing,\u201d Hwang explains. \u201cBut you have to know with organizations that the president never calls you, right?  If it\u2019s an important enough organization, it\u2019s always got to be his assistant, so my official title is Deputy Director; there currently is no director.\u201d\n\nWhy the keen interest in visiting a power plant? Or, for that matter, any of the sites that the Bay Area Infrastructure Observatory have visited, which include The National Ignition Facility, a container terminal, or the newly constructed San Francisco Bay Bridge extension? \n\n\u201dI think we live in an environment nowadays which is kind of very restricted as to what you can see and really, what you can learn about,\u201d Hwang says. \n\n\u201cEverything from the design of a chair to the setting of the size of a bike lane, these are all choices that ultimately, people make.  And I think it\u2019s really inspirational that people are willing to kind of struggle to make that thing happen because no matter how small, it actually has a really big impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very much just about, \u201cHey, these places are really cool.  It\u2019d be great to learn more about them and it\u2019s weird that we don\u2019t know more about them.\u201d\n\n*Note: Sutro Tower is not open for public tours.

It's just one step of many that Alex has taken in his journey to feel like his true self.\n\nThough the big moment is full of anticipation and excitement for Alex, he also has some worries. He has been watching videos on YouTube of other people in the trans community who have been in his shoes. \"In all the videos I watched up until now to prep for this, I've never seen anyone be like, 'Oh, you know, this is the negative side of it.' Or, 'This is what I'm feeling. I'm feeling loss in this area.' And so for the past week, I've been thinking of memories or times when it didn't always feel so ugly. I'm like, \"Why am I feeling this way? Is this feeling normal? Is this right?\"\n\nEver since early childhood, Alex knew that he struggled to fit in. \"I always felt different,\" says Alex. \"I lived in a really small town where like LGBT things weren't talked about, so I had no idea or ever thought to myself that that could be my future, so it just tore me up for a while.\"\n\nLater in his teenage years, Alex discovered the trans community online - on both Tumblr and through videos on YouTube. He felt an immediate connection, and in 2011, began posting videos himself to YouTube, looking for answers as he struggled with his gender identity.\n\nThe community and information available opened Alex's eyes to the possibilities, but he feared that it would be impossible for him to do, based on potential lack of friends or family support. \"I can't introduce my dad to my girlfriend because he's so homophobic and unsupportive, so I felt like it was unreachable. I had finally found an answer and I would never be able to do it.\"\n\nAlex was able to find some support within his family and friends, and so he decided to move out and begin testosterone therapy, which he documented on his YouTube channel. After a year long transformation on testosterone, Alex decided he was ready for another step - top surgery.\n\n\"I want people to see that not every story is the same, but I think also to keep in mind that not every trans person wants what I do,\" he says. \"I think with Caitlyn Jenner and a lot of the trans celebrities that are in the world for us to look at, it very much paints this idea that taking hormones and having surgery equals trans. But I have a lot of friends who aren't healthy enough to take hormones or who don't want to have surgery. These things don't equal trans; you can be trans without them.\"\n\n\"Before I had the surgery, I was still a man and now that I've had it, I'm still the same person, it's just I feel more comfortable.\"\n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp - iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp - Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Paige Keipper (Hansen)\nCinematographer: Spencer Snider\nEditor: Lee Mould",

                "description": "Watch the next episode about Lauren Singer, who produced only a  jar's worth of trash in 2 years: http://bit.ly/1QsnSqu  \nSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/c/seekerstories?sub_confirmation=1\n\nIn 2003, the local government in Kamikatsu, Japan decided to require that all residents comply with a new, rigorous recycling program - perhaps the most rigorous in the world. \n\nSince then, the town composts, recycles, or reuses 80% of its garbage. It may not technically be 100% zero waste, as the remaining 20% goes into the landfill, but it's a remarkable achievement for an entire community, in such a short amount of time. The impacts have been positive - cutting costs for the community drastically, as well as improving the conditions of the lush and beautiful environment that surrounds the town in Southeast Japan.\n\nResidents must wash and sort virtually anything that is non-compostable in their household before bringing it to the recycling sorting center. Shampoo bottles, caps, cans, razors, styrofoam meat trays, water bottles...the list goes on and on (literally) into 34 categories. At the sorting center, labels on each bin indicate the recycling process for that specific item - how it will be recycled, what it will become, and how much that process can cost (or even earn). It's an education process for the consumer.\n\nAll kitchen scraps must be composted at home, as the town has no garbage trucks or collectors. \n\nAnd as for other items, reuse is heavily encouraged.  According to Akira Sakano, Deputy Chief Officer at Zero Waste Academy in Kamikatsu, the town has a kuru-kuru shop where residents can bring in used items and take things home for free. There is also a kuru-kuru factory, where local women make bags and clothes out of discarded items. \n\nAt first, it was difficult to be come accustomed to the new rules. \"It can be a pain, and at first we were opposed to the idea,\" says resident, Hatsue Katayama. \"If you get used to it, it becomes normal.\"\n\nNow, it's even being noticed within Kamikatsu's businesses. The first zero-waste brewery has opened in Kamikatsu, called Rise and Win Brewery. The brewery itself is constructed of reused materials and environmentally friendly finishes. By 2020, Kamikatsu hopes to be 100% zero waste, with no use of landfills, and to forge connections with other like-minded communities in the world, spreading the practice of zero-waste. \n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp - iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp - Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Paige Keipper (Hansen)\nCinematographer: Irene Carolina Herrera\nEditor: Lee Mould",

                    "description": "Watch the next episode about Lauren Singer, who produced only a  jar's worth of trash in 2 years: http://bit.ly/1QsnSqu  \nSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/c/seekerstories?sub_confirmation=1\n\nIn 2003, the local government in Kamikatsu, Japan decided to require that all residents comply with a new, rigorous recycling program - perhaps the most rigorous in the world. \n\nSince then, the town composts, recycles, or reuses 80% of its garbage. It may not technically be 100% zero waste, as the remaining 20% goes into the landfill, but it's a remarkable achievement for an entire community, in such a short amount of time. The impacts have been positive - cutting costs for the community drastically, as well as improving the conditions of the lush and beautiful environment that surrounds the town in Southeast Japan.\n\nResidents must wash and sort virtually anything that is non-compostable in their household before bringing it to the recycling sorting center. Shampoo bottles, caps, cans, razors, styrofoam meat trays, water bottles...the list goes on and on (literally) into 34 categories. At the sorting center, labels on each bin indicate the recycling process for that specific item - how it will be recycled, what it will become, and how much that process can cost (or even earn). It's an education process for the consumer.\n\nAll kitchen scraps must be composted at home, as the town has no garbage trucks or collectors. \n\nAnd as for other items, reuse is heavily encouraged.  According to Akira Sakano, Deputy Chief Officer at Zero Waste Academy in Kamikatsu, the town has a kuru-kuru shop where residents can bring in used items and take things home for free. There is also a kuru-kuru factory, where local women make bags and clothes out of discarded items. \n\nAt first, it was difficult to be come accustomed to the new rules. \"It can be a pain, and at first we were opposed to the idea,\" says resident, Hatsue Katayama. \"If you get used to it, it becomes normal.\"\n\nNow, it's even being noticed within Kamikatsu's businesses.

Within a few years, he and co-founder Ashu Desai, started The Make School, a college replacement program for founders and developers. \n\n\"Our core philosophy is if you teach the same thing two years in a row, it's got to be wrong because computer science as a field and software engineering as a discipline is moving so fast,\" said Rossmann.\n\nInstead of tests, there's project-based work.

To which Rossmann responds, \"When LinkedIn and Lyft and these companies with tens of millions of dollars of funding are all committing contractually to coming and recruit here, and they don't come to the school where your child is studying, that means something.\"\n\nTo watch Turning Junk into Treehouses, click here: http://bit.ly/1IkgVqe  \nSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/c/seekerstories?sub_confirmation=1\n\nJoin the Seeker community!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeekerNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seeker-Network/872690716088418?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seekernetwork\nTumblr: http://seekernetwork.tumblr.com \nApp - iOS http://seekernetwork.com/ios\nApp - Android http://seekernetwork.com/android\n\nExecutive Producer: Laura Ling\nProducer: Paige Keipper (Hansen)\nCinematographer: Spencer Snider, Alex Gerhard\nEditor: Lee Mould",
