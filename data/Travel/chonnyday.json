It's helped me drop a lot of weight, better myself as a person/friend and also a great stress reliever. \nIf volleyball interests you in the slightest, I think you should give it a go! It's great fun and pretty easy to pick up\n\nFollow on:\nInstagram: @lechonny\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/mychonny\nComedy Channel: http://www.youtube.com/yourchonny\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Mychonny-146853695356556/\nBusiness Email: chonnydaymail@gmail.com\n\nThanks for watching!

It has been deadly but very rewarding!\n\nI've gained a bit of weight over the year/s and have wanted to get fit again. AND THE TIMING IS NOW!!!\nIt's definitely a lot harder to lose weight at my age (my metabolism is a lot slower than it used to be) but I had to soldier on and fight my way through haha\nVlogging the experience was very motivating and kept me on my dietary plan. I plan on continuing with my diet/exercise and will keep you guys updated on a regular basis! Let's hope I don't gain all the weight back.\nALL the food you see in this video is what I ate. I didn't sneak in a hamburger or any snacks... COLD TURKEY DAT BISH!\n\nIf you enjoyed the vlog, please give it a LIKE and SUBSCRIBE!\nI'll have a regular, FUN vlog for you guys next week but will continue to film my workout/diets (trying intermittent fasting for 10 days)\n\nFollow me on:\nInstagram: @lechonny \nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/mychonny\nComedy Channel: http://www.youtube.com/yourchonny\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Mychonny-146853695356556/\nBusiness Email: chonnydaymail@gmail.com\n\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING!",
