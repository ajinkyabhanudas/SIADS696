Watch the full episode: https://youtu.be/cfT7P9Vdq7o Vienna's historic center is encircled by a road called the Ringstrasse. In the 1860s, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria had Vienna's medieval walls torn down and replaced with this grand boulevard. Today, the three-mile loop is lined with many of Vienna's top sights; hop aboard one of the trams that traverse the Ringstrasse for a DIY, budget tour of the city.

Then, the next night, we return with our gear, create the lighting we need, be sure those dining around us are ok with us filming them, and make it happen. There are so many complicated little dimensions of filming a great meal, but we do our best to include one in each show.\n\nWhile filming a meal is never relaxing, it almost always looks that way. Here\u2019s a candid little moment as we set up to film dinner at a fish joint in Alexandria. Although we were eating before many other diners arrived, we peopled the place with the entourage that accompanies us everywhere we go: driver, security, and local officials excited to get a photo with us.\n\nVisit http://www.ricksteves.com for more information.",

                    "description": "When we film a dinner in a restaurant, I like to eat there the night before to make friends with the wait staff, learn the rhythm and quirks of the place, reserve the best table for the cameraman\u2019s needs, and learn which dishes we\u2019d like to feature in the show\u2014while actually enjoying a meal there. Then, the next night, we return with our gear, create the lighting we need, be sure those dining around us are ok with us filming them, and make it happen. There are so many complicated little dimensions of filming a great meal, but we do our best to include one in each show.\n\nWhile filming a meal is never relaxing, it almost always looks that way. Here\u2019s a candid little moment as we set up to film dinner at a fish joint in Alexandria. Although we were eating before many other diners arrived, we peopled the place with the entourage that accompanies us everywhere we go: driver, security, and local officials excited to get a photo with us.\n\nVisit http://www.ricksteves.com for more information."

We'll trace fascism's history from its roots in the turbulent aftermath of World War I, when masses of angry people rose up, to the rise of charismatic leaders who manipulated that anger, the totalitarian societies they built, and the brutal measures they used to enforce their ideology. We'll see the horrific consequences: genocide and total war. And we'll be inspired by the stories of those who resisted. Along the way, we'll visit poignant sights throughout Europe relating to fascism, and talk with Europeans whose families lived through those times.

And traveling here, I feel like I\u2019m witnessing a country that has been famously poor evolving into a developed nation.\n\nIn order to develop, Ethiopia wants investment, not charity. Ethiopia earns little from exports \u2014 its biggest export, coffee, only generates about $700 million a year. But it has a huge untapped natural resource of young people who are ready to work for wages that are much lower than those in the developed world. With more labor than physical resources, big corporations use a poor country like Ethiopia as a base to \"re-export\u201d\u2014 a place to import a product (like cloth), process it affordably, and re-export it (as clothing). \n\nGlobally, development seems to come in waves: China\u2026India\u2026and now, perhaps, sub-Saharan Africa. Ethiopia\u2019s leaders wouldn\u2019t mind following \u201cthe China model\u201d of development, which depends on cheap labor, as a way to compete with countries like China and India, where wages have risen. \n\nHere\u2019s a quick peek at Ethiopia\u2019s massive Hawassa Industrial Park \u2014 and what could be the future of an Africa that is more profitably integrated into the global economy. \n \n__\nYou can find out more about my trip to Ethiopia at https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/tag/ethiopia",

And traveling here, I feel like I\u2019m witnessing a country that has been famously poor evolving into a developed nation.\n\nIn order to develop, Ethiopia wants investment, not charity. Ethiopia earns little from exports \u2014 its biggest export, coffee, only generates about $700 million a year. But it has a huge untapped natural resource of young people who are ready to work for wages that are much lower than those in the developed world. With more labor than physical resources, big corporations use a poor country like Ethiopia as a base to \"re-export\u201d\u2014 a place to import a product (like cloth), process it affordably, and re-export it (as clothing). \n\nGlobally, development seems to come in waves: China\u2026India\u2026and now, perhaps, sub-Saharan Africa. Ethiopia\u2019s leaders wouldn\u2019t mind following \u201cthe China model\u201d of development, which depends on cheap labor, as a way to compete with countries like China and India, where wages have risen. \n\nHere\u2019s a quick peek at Ethiopia\u2019s massive Hawassa Industrial Park \u2014 and what could be the future of an Africa that is more profitably integrated into the global economy. \n \n__\nYou can find out more about my trip to Ethiopia at https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/tag/ethiopia"

Invariably our episodes come in at 32 minutes or so, and I need to make the hard cuts. While it\u2019s painful to lose bits I really like, the tighter shows are better without them.\n\nMany of you have been watching Rick Steves\u2019 Europe for literally decades, and I thought, as we celebrate the arrival of our tenth season (12 all-new episodes debuting next month on public television throughout the USA), I\u2019d share with you the kind of footage that ends up on our cutting room floor.\n\nIn this little clip, you\u2019ll see what we cut from our upcoming Scottish Highlands episode:\n \n\u2022 The Inveraray Castle, which houses clan mementos that are precious to Campbells.\n\u2022 McCaig\u2019s Tower, a silly \u201cfolly\u201d in Oban. (Beautifully filmed mediocre sights in bad weather are the first to go.)\n\u2022 Me sharing a tip for road-trippers to get out of the car and take little hikes. (Fun asides are easy to cut when we\u2019re running long because they don\u2019t impact the structure of the script.)\n\u2022 The town of Fort William. (This was an entire module \u2014 like pulling a tooth, it only hurts once to lose it...but I hated to delete the great sound bite from our guide Colin, with his nice dig at English imperialism.)\n\u2022 Much of the Scottish Crannog Centre. (This was just too much information, so we used a much shorter version.) \n\u2022 A juvenile clip of me searching for the Loch Ness monster (which was not too juvenile to end up in our bloopers).\n\nThanks to all our travelers, whose viewership has kept us on the air for so long, and to public television, which continues to be a lonely bright spot in the broadcast media landscape of America. Stay tuned for lots of Rick Steves\u2019 Europe this fall \u2014 including episodes on Portugal (Lisbon and the country's heartland), the heart of England, Greek islands, Sicily (Best of Sicily and Sicilian Delights), Scotland (Glasgow, Highlands, and islands), cruising travel skills, and two special episodes on Europe's greatest festivals.

Sure, you'd be hard-pressed to find a dentist or an accountant working in August. But Paris is never deserted (where would 2.2 million people go?), and you'll find it easy to tap into the city's breezy summertime fun. And, if you time your trip right, you'll be in town for a big party. On July 14, France celebrates Bastille Day with a huge, patriotic bash \u2014 and everyone's welcome to join in. You'll get a taste of the fun in this clip from my new, one-hour Rick Steves' European Festivals public television special.\n\nStart planning your trip now with my \"Rick Steves France 2018\" guidebook: https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/p/france-guidebook.",

                    "description": "There's an old travel mantra that you should avoid Paris in summer, when its citizens traditionally go on vacation. Don't listen! Sure, you'd be hard-pressed to find a dentist or an accountant working in August. But Paris is never deserted (where would 2.2 million people go?), and you'll find it easy to tap into the city's breezy summertime fun. And, if you time your trip right, you'll be in town for a big party. On July 14, France celebrates Bastille Day with a huge, patriotic bash \u2014 and everyone's welcome to join in. You'll get a taste of the fun in this clip from my new, one-hour Rick Steves' European Festivals public television special.\n\nStart planning your trip now with my \"Rick Steves France 2018\" guidebook: https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/p/france-guidebook."

In addition to all its epic history and high culture, Europe also knows how to celebrate \u2014 and it does so with amazing gusto. Joining Rick, we drop in on the Continent\u2019s top 10 festivals, each one rich with tradition, great food, and fun with the locals. We run with the bulls at Pamplona, don a mask in Venice for Carnevale, dance with Spaniards at the April Fair, cheer on the horses at Siena's Palio, hoist a frothy stein at Munich's Oktoberfest, toss a caber at a Scottish Highland Games, and join European families for their traditional Easter and Christmas celebrations. No museums or galleries\u2026just Europe at play. Filmed on location across Europe, this promises to be a very entertaining hour.",

In addition to all its epic history and high culture, Europe also knows how to celebrate \u2014 and it does so with amazing gusto. Joining Rick, we drop in on the Continent\u2019s top 10 festivals, each one rich with tradition, great food, and fun with the locals. We run with the bulls at Pamplona, don a mask in Venice for Carnevale, dance with Spaniards at the April Fair, cheer on the horses at Siena's Palio, hoist a frothy stein at Munich's Oktoberfest, toss a caber at a Scottish Highland Games, and join European families for their traditional Easter and Christmas celebrations. No museums or galleries\u2026just Europe at play. Filmed on location across Europe, this promises to be a very entertaining hour."

We'll tour Romania's vibrant capital, Bucharest, with its \"Little Paris of the East\" architecture and lingering reminders of a brutal communist dictator. Then we'll head into Transylvania, where we\u2019ll visit fortified churches, cobbled merchant towns like Sighi\u0219oara, and castles made famous by an imported German king and the real-life Dracula. Finally we\u2019ll explore Maramure\u0219, where everyday life still feels like an open-air folk museum.\n\nAt http://www.ricksteves.com, you'll find money-saving travel tips, small-group tours, guidebooks, TV shows, radio programs, podcasts, and more on this destination."

In Israel, we go from the venerable ramparts of Jerusalem to the vibrant modern skyline of Tel Aviv. In Palestine, we harvest olives near Hebron, visit a home in Bethlehem, and pop into a university in Ramallah. We also learn about security walls, disputed settlements, and the persistent challenges facing the region. #ricksteves #ricksteveseurope #holyland"

Built with pillaged materials, some describe the church's eclectic style as \"Early Ransack.\" The outside is a riot of domes, columns, and statues; the interior is covered with mosaics, colored marbles, and oriental treasures. #ricksteves #ricksteveseurope #venice\n\nVisit http://www.ricksteves.com for more information about this destination and other destinations in Europe.\n\nCheck out more Rick Steves\u2019 Europe travel resources:\n \u201cRick Steves\u2019 Europe\u201d public television series: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read...\n \u201cTravel with Rick Steves\u201d public radio program: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read...\n European Tours: https://www.ricksteves.com/tours\n Guidebooks: https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/gui...\n Travel Gear: https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/\n Trip Consulting: https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-hel...\n Travel Classes: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read...\n Rick Steves Audio Europe App: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read...\n \nRick Steves, America's most respected authority on European travel, writes European travel guidebooks, and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.",

After the saint's remains were smuggled here in 828, Venice took his symbol (the winged lion) as their own. Built with pillaged materials, some describe the church's eclectic style as \"Early Ransack.\" The outside is a riot of domes, columns, and statues; the interior is covered with mosaics, colored marbles, and oriental treasures. #ricksteves #ricksteveseurope #venice\n\nVisit http://www.ricksteves.com for more information about this destination and other destinations in Europe.\n\nCheck out more Rick Steves\u2019 Europe travel resources:\n \u201cRick Steves\u2019 Europe\u201d public television series: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read...\n \u201cTravel with Rick Steves\u201d public radio program: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read...\n European Tours: https://www.ricksteves.com/tours\n Guidebooks: https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/gui...\n Travel Gear: https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/\n Trip Consulting: https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-hel...\n Travel Classes: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read...\n Rick Steves Audio Europe App: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read...\n \nRick Steves, America's most respected authority on European travel, writes European travel guidebooks, and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio."

We'll cruise the Grand Canal, luxuriate in a venerable caf\u00e9, and savor fresh fish canal-side with Venetian friends. Becoming as anonymous as possible in this city of masks, we'll be dazzled by masterpieces of the Venetian Renaissance and get intimate with the city of Casanova...on a gondola in the moonlight. #ricksteves #ricksteveseurope #venice \n\n\u00a9 2012 Rick Steves' Europe"

This 73-mile long undulating wall likely defined and protected the bleak northern edge of Roman Britain from pesky barbarians. Much-loved by hikers and historians, the wall is truly one of England's most thought-provoking sights. #ricksteves #england #hadrianswall\n\nVisit http://www.ricksteves.com for more information about this destination and other destinations in Europe.\n\nCheck out more Rick Steves\u2019 Europe travel resources:\n \u201cRick Steves\u2019 Europe\u201d public television series: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/video/tv-show\n \u201cTravel with Rick Steves\u201d public radio program: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/radio\n European Tours: https://www.ricksteves.com/tours\n Guidebooks: https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/guidebooks\n Travel Gear: https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/\n Trip Consulting: https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-help/plan-your-trip-with-our-expert-consultants\n Travel Classes: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/video/travel-talks\n Rick Steves Audio Europe App: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-europe\n \nRick Steves, America's most respected authority on European travel, writes European travel guidebooks, and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio."

In 1941, the Nazis removed the town's 7,000 inhabitants and brought in 60,000 Jews, creating a concentration camp \u2014 a propaganda model \"Jewish town.\" Life in this sham town appeared tolerable to human rights visitors but the reality was far more cruel \u2014 virtually all of Terez\u00edn's Jews ultimately ended up dying either here or at extermination camps farther east.

In 1941, the Nazis removed the town's 7,000 inhabitants and brought in 60,000 Jews, creating a concentration camp \u2014 a propaganda model \"Jewish town.\" Life in this sham town appeared tolerable to human rights visitors but the reality was far more cruel \u2014 virtually all of Terez\u00edn's Jews ultimately ended up dying either here or at extermination camps farther east.
