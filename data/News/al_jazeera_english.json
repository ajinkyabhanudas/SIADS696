                "description": "In the war in Ukraine, recent territorial gains by Ukrainian forces have now been overshadowed by the anticipated Russian annexation of large parts of the country\u2019s east that could lead to many more months of intensified fighting.\n\nEarlier this month, a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the northeastern region of Kharkiv resulted in the retreat of Russian troops and subsequent discovery of suspected Russian war crimes. Soon after, President Vladimir Putin called for roughly 300,000 reservists to join the war in a \"partial mobilisation\" mandate that triggered violence and unrest in some Russian towns.\n\nThis week, Moscow\u2019s \"staged referendums\" have paved the way for the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia. Declaring full Russian control in these areas - which make up about 15% of Ukraine - could set the stage for another escalation in the more than seven-month-old war. For Ukrainian men who remain in the area, many fear they will be conscripted into fighting a war against their own people.\n\nIn this episode of The Stream, we'll look at how Ukrainians are dealing with the latest shifts in the war.\n\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#ukrainewar",

                    "description": "In the war in Ukraine, recent territorial gains by Ukrainian forces have now been overshadowed by the anticipated Russian annexation of large parts of the country\u2019s east that could lead to many more months of intensified fighting.\n\nEarlier this month, a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the northeastern region of Kharkiv resulted in the retreat of Russian troops and subsequent discovery of suspected Russian war crimes. Soon after, President Vladimir Putin called for roughly 300,000 reservists to join the war in a \"partial mobilisation\" mandate that triggered violence and unrest in some Russian towns.\n\nThis week, Moscow\u2019s \"staged referendums\" have paved the way for the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia. Declaring full Russian control in these areas - which make up about 15% of Ukraine - could set the stage for another escalation in the more than seven-month-old war. For Ukrainian men who remain in the area, many fear they will be conscripted into fighting a war against their own people.\n\nIn this episode of The Stream, we'll look at how Ukrainians are dealing with the latest shifts in the war.\n\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#ukrainewar"

With 33 million people affected and a death toll that has surpassed 1,500, authorities are now raising alarm about the potential for a new wave of deaths resulting from water-borne diseases along with hunger due to the devastation of crops. \u201cAll this means more unsafe births, more untreated diabetes or heart disease, and more children missing vaccination, to name but a few of the impacts on health,\u201d warned The World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. We look at the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Pakistan following recent devastating floods. \n\nPuerto Rico: \nFlooding, mudslides and blackouts have incapacitated Puerto Rico following the landfall of Hurricane Fiona on September 18. The storm knocked out power across the US island territory, and 10 days later, hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans continue to live without access to power and water. Meanwhile, some communities remain entirely cut off from access to aid as fuel for backup generators begins to run low. Fiona landed days before the five year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the territory and killed more than 3,000 people in 2017. This most recent hurricane is a stark warning of the threat that compounding climate-related events pose to vulnerable communities and critical infrastructure on an island that never fully recovered from the impact of Maria. We discuss recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and what\u2019s needed to bolster the island against future severe weather events. \n\nJoin the conversation: \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#pakistan #puertorico",

                "description": "Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has widened his lead over incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, less than a week before one of the most divisive presidential elections in Brazil\u2019s history.\r\nA Genial/Quaest poll released on Wednesday showed Lula, who served as president from 2003 to 2010, with a 13-percentage-point lead over his far-right rival.\r\nRecent polls indicate that the former left-wing leader could beat Bolsonaro in the first round of voting on Sunday. In 2003, Lula became Brazil\u2019s first working class president.\r\nHe introduced sweeping social programs to combat poverty and lift the station of working class Brazilians from providing education to fresh water access.\r\nTwelve years after he left office with more than 80% percent approval ratings, an older, and perhaps more cautious Lula has return, promising to bring back better days, especially for the poor.  \r\n\r\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Lucia Newman travelled to Pernambuco, Lula's place of birth and one of the country's poorest regions to find out how it all began.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\r\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\r\nFind us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\r\nCheck our website:  http://www.aljazeera.com/\r\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\r\n\r\n#Brazil #BrazilElection #Lula2022 #LulaDaSilva",

                    "description": "Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has widened his lead over incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, less than a week before one of the most divisive presidential elections in Brazil\u2019s history.\r\nA Genial/Quaest poll released on Wednesday showed Lula, who served as president from 2003 to 2010, with a 13-percentage-point lead over his far-right rival.\r\nRecent polls indicate that the former left-wing leader could beat Bolsonaro in the first round of voting on Sunday. In 2003, Lula became Brazil\u2019s first working class president.\r\nHe introduced sweeping social programs to combat poverty and lift the station of working class Brazilians from providing education to fresh water access.\r\nTwelve years after he left office with more than 80% percent approval ratings, an older, and perhaps more cautious Lula has return, promising to bring back better days, especially for the poor.  \r\n\r\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Lucia Newman travelled to Pernambuco, Lula's place of birth and one of the country's poorest regions to find out how it all began.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\r\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\r\nFind us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\r\nCheck our website:  http://www.aljazeera.com/\r\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\r\n\r\n#Brazil #BrazilElection #Lula2022 #LulaDaSilva"

It made him appear unfit to govern and led to a crushing electoral defeat. \n \nAn analysis of internal party documents, social media data and covert recordings reveals how senior Labour officials used the party\u2019s procedures to undermine support for Jeremy Corbyn and to silence debate about Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians. \nThe files also show how pro-Israel groups ask the party to distance itself from the Boycott Divest and Sanctions campaign, a protest movement that seeks to end Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian lands, and how - in response - the Jewish Board of Deputies was assured that Labour would \u201cnever accept attempts to exceptionalise and deligitimise Israel.\u201d\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website:  http://www.aljazeera.com/\n@AljazeeraEnglish\n#aljazeeraenglish \n#aljazeerainvestigations  \n#News",

It made him appear unfit to govern and led to a crushing electoral defeat. \n \nAn analysis of internal party documents, social media data and covert recordings reveals how senior Labour officials used the party\u2019s procedures to undermine support for Jeremy Corbyn and to silence debate about Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians. \nThe files also show how pro-Israel groups ask the party to distance itself from the Boycott Divest and Sanctions campaign, a protest movement that seeks to end Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian lands, and how - in response - the Jewish Board of Deputies was assured that Labour would \u201cnever accept attempts to exceptionalise and deligitimise Israel.\u201d\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website:  http://www.aljazeera.com/\n@AljazeeraEnglish\n#aljazeeraenglish \n#aljazeerainvestigations  \n#News"

                    "description": "A series of killings of Muslim men in New Mexico has sent a wave of fear through Muslim communities across the United States.\r\nAuthorities identified the fourth victim on Monday, and have not ruled out the possibility that the murders of several Muslim men in the city of Albuquerque could be linked.\r\nThree of the killings happened in the last week, and authorities have said that the race and religion of the victims were common factors. \u201cInvestigators believe Friday\u2019s murder may be connected to three recent murders of Muslim men also from South Asia,\u201d police said. Police have asked residents to help find a vehicle they believe is connected to the killings.\r\n\u201cI am angered and saddened by the horrific killings of four Muslim men in Albuquerque,\u201d Biden said on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cWhile we await a full investigation, my prayers are with the victims\u2019 families, and my administration stands strongly with the Muslim community. These hateful attacks have no place in America.\u201d\r\n\r\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Patty Culhane reports.\r\n\r\n- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe \r\n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish \r\n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera \r\n- Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/\r\n\r\n#USMuslims #MuslimsLiveMatters #Albuquerque"

Despite the treacherous roads, regular passengers journey to the nearest town, Senkaya. This trip allows a tight-knit group of friends to banter, bond and discuss their challenging lives.\n\nThis remote bus service also reveals local environmental change. There has been a reduction in snowfall which used to help keep the soil fertile, but now the frozen-solid ground has become harder to farm, threatening livelihoods here.\n\nIn Turkey\u2019s Senkaya Bus, we get an insight into communities, cultures and environmental change in eastern Turkey.\n\nAl Jazeera World:\n- YouTube: https://aje.me/AJWplaylist\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/AlJazeeraWorld\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlJazeeraWorld\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/_aljazeeraworld/\n- Website: https://www.aljazeera.com/program/al-jazeera-world/\n#AlJazeeraWorld",

Despite the treacherous roads, regular passengers journey to the nearest town, Senkaya. This trip allows a tight-knit group of friends to banter, bond and discuss their challenging lives.\n\nThis remote bus service also reveals local environmental change. There has been a reduction in snowfall which used to help keep the soil fertile, but now the frozen-solid ground has become harder to farm, threatening livelihoods here.\n\nIn Turkey\u2019s Senkaya Bus, we get an insight into communities, cultures and environmental change in eastern Turkey.\n\nAl Jazeera World:\n- YouTube: https://aje.me/AJWplaylist\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/AlJazeeraWorld\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlJazeeraWorld\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/_aljazeeraworld/\n- Website: https://www.aljazeera.com/program/al-jazeera-world/\n#AlJazeeraWorld"

                "description": "A wave of violent attacks on India\u2019s Muslim population has the community on edge. In recent weeks, hundreds of people have been injured and a handful killed as part of a rise in communal violence across the country.\u00a0\n\nLast week a number of Muslim-owned shops were razed in New Delhi before bulldozers were ordered to stop by India\u2019s Supreme Court. Officials say they were targeting illegal buildings and not any particular religious group.\u00a0\n\nBut critics say it is the latest attempt to harass India\u2019s Muslim minority, which makes up roughly 14 percent of the country\u2019s 1.4 billion population. The Hindu majority accounts for 80 percent.\u00a0\n\nHuman Rights observers say recent incendiary rhetoric by politicians from Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is helping fuel the country\u2019s growing religious polarisation. However, India\u2019s Minority Affairs Minister has tried to play down the recent upheaval by saying religious intolerance isn\u2019t worsening in the country.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn this episode of The Stream we discuss what\u2019s causing the violence and what can be done to bring about peace.\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#india",

                    "description": "A wave of violent attacks on India\u2019s Muslim population has the community on edge. In recent weeks, hundreds of people have been injured and a handful killed as part of a rise in communal violence across the country.\u00a0\n\nLast week a number of Muslim-owned shops were razed in New Delhi before bulldozers were ordered to stop by India\u2019s Supreme Court. Officials say they were targeting illegal buildings and not any particular religious group.\u00a0\n\nBut critics say it is the latest attempt to harass India\u2019s Muslim minority, which makes up roughly 14 percent of the country\u2019s 1.4 billion population. The Hindu majority accounts for 80 percent.\u00a0\n\nHuman Rights observers say recent incendiary rhetoric by politicians from Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is helping fuel the country\u2019s growing religious polarisation. However, India\u2019s Minority Affairs Minister has tried to play down the recent upheaval by saying religious intolerance isn\u2019t worsening in the country.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn this episode of The Stream we discuss what\u2019s causing the violence and what can be done to bring about peace.\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#india"

This is usually the shrub Psychotria viridis,[7] but Diplopterys cabrerana may be used as a substitute.[8][9] Other plant ingredients often or occasionally used in the production of ayahuasca include Justicia pectoralis,[10] one of the Brugmansia (especially Brugmansia insignis and Brugmansia versicolor, or a hybrid breed) or Datura species,[11] and mapacho (Nicotiana rustica).[12]",

                "description": "Death by suicide is a growing public health crisis in India and one that is impacting all communities, regardless of socioeconomic status. \n \nIn 2020 there were 153,052 recorded deaths by suicide according to the latest government data. That\u2019s roughly 418 people taking their own lives every day. The report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) cited \u201cfamily problems\u201d to be one of the main reasons people chose to kill themselves. The economic uncertainty brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic is another driving force behind the climbing numbers, particularly amongst India\u2019s middle class. \n \nWhile the statistics from the NCRB are staggering, many mental health advocates feel the numbers are actually much higher. They believe the government\u2019s alleged under-reporting is a symptom of the social stigma associated with suicide. Although India recently decriminalised suicide in an effort to address the problem, societal stigma has yet to be dismantled and remains a major hurdle when it comes to prevention and access to resources.   \n \nOn this episode of The Stream we discuss what\u2019s driving the crisis and ask what can be done to address it.\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#india",

                    "description": "Death by suicide is a growing public health crisis in India and one that is impacting all communities, regardless of socioeconomic status. \n \nIn 2020 there were 153,052 recorded deaths by suicide according to the latest government data. That\u2019s roughly 418 people taking their own lives every day. The report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) cited \u201cfamily problems\u201d to be one of the main reasons people chose to kill themselves. The economic uncertainty brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic is another driving force behind the climbing numbers, particularly amongst India\u2019s middle class. \n \nWhile the statistics from the NCRB are staggering, many mental health advocates feel the numbers are actually much higher. They believe the government\u2019s alleged under-reporting is a symptom of the social stigma associated with suicide. Although India recently decriminalised suicide in an effort to address the problem, societal stigma has yet to be dismantled and remains a major hurdle when it comes to prevention and access to resources.   \n \nOn this episode of The Stream we discuss what\u2019s driving the crisis and ask what can be done to address it.\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#india"

But now this $5bn industry is in freefall.\r\n\r\nEvery week, two Indian restaurants are shutting down as COVID-19, changing consumer tastes, and Brexit take a toll.\r\n\r\nIn this documentary, 101 East correspondent Drew Ambrose travels across the UK to find out why Britain\u2019s curry houses are in crisis.\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nReporter: Drew Ambrose\r\nProducers: Siwaporn Kingston and Aun Qi Koh\r\nCamera: Craig Hansen\r\nPicture Editor: Badrul Hisham\r\nResearch assistant: Jenni Henderson\r\nDigital Producer: Hasham Cheema\r\nSenior Supervising Producer: Nick Olle\r\nExecutive Producer: Sharon Roobol\r\n \r\nPhotos courtesy of : Tower Hamlets Archives, Tim Smith, Eastside Community Heritage, Mohammad Ali, Raju Vaidyanathan and the British Curry Awards\r\n \r\nFor more, follow 101 East:\r\nwww.instagram.com/aj101east\r\nwww.twitter.com/aj101east\r\nwww.facebook.com/101east"

The country\u2019s borders have also been closed, it added. \r\nBefore the army statement, the African Union and the West African bloc ECOWAS both condemned what they called an attempted coup, saying they held the military responsible for Kabore\u2019s safety.\r\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres said in a statement that he \u201cstrongly condemns any attempted takeover of government by the force of arms\u201d, calling the events a \u201ccoup\u201d.\r\n\r\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Nicolas Haque reports.\r\n\r\n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish/\r\n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera/\r\n- Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/\r\n\r\n#BurkinaFaso #BurkinaFasoCoup #Kabore",

The country\u2019s borders have also been closed, it added. \r\nBefore the army statement, the African Union and the West African bloc ECOWAS both condemned what they called an attempted coup, saying they held the military responsible for Kabore\u2019s safety.\r\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres said in a statement that he \u201cstrongly condemns any attempted takeover of government by the force of arms\u201d, calling the events a \u201ccoup\u201d.\r\n\r\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Nicolas Haque reports.\r\n\r\n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish/\r\n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera/\r\n- Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/\r\n\r\n#BurkinaFaso #BurkinaFasoCoup #Kabore"

                "description": "Kazakhstan is restive after government forces subdued the most widespread anti-government protests since the country declared independence in 1991.\n\nThe death toll from several days of unrest remains unclear, with the country\u2019s interior ministry on Sunday retracting a statement that at least 164 people had died. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has called the protests an \u201cattempted coup d\u2019etat\u201d, without offering evidence. Nearly 10,000 people have been detained, the country\u2019s interior ministry says.\n\nThe protests began on January 2 in the western town of Zhanaozen, a day after the government removed subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that people use to fuel vehicles, doubling its price. Thousands of people soon joined demonstrations in other parts of Kazakhstan, including in the capital Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the country\u2019s most populous city. \n\nDemonstrators shouted slogans against Tokayev\u2019s government and Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stood down as president in 2019 after nearly three decades but who still wields considerable political and economic power behind the scenes. While many protesters were peaceful there were violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces.\n\nAs Russian troops joined a regional peacekeeping force deployment to Kazakhstan at Tokayev\u2019s request, the president ordered security forces to \u201cshoot to kill without warning\u201d to quell unrest that he blamed on foreign-trained \"terrorist groups\". There are now signs that Tokayev is moving to sweep out Nazarbayev loyalists and consolidate his own power.\n\nIn this episode of The Stream, we'll talk about what brought so many people to take to the streets in Kazakhstan and ask what happens next.\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#kazakhstan",

                    "description": "Kazakhstan is restive after government forces subdued the most widespread anti-government protests since the country declared independence in 1991.\n\nThe death toll from several days of unrest remains unclear, with the country\u2019s interior ministry on Sunday retracting a statement that at least 164 people had died. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has called the protests an \u201cattempted coup d\u2019etat\u201d, without offering evidence. Nearly 10,000 people have been detained, the country\u2019s interior ministry says.\n\nThe protests began on January 2 in the western town of Zhanaozen, a day after the government removed subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that people use to fuel vehicles, doubling its price. Thousands of people soon joined demonstrations in other parts of Kazakhstan, including in the capital Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the country\u2019s most populous city. \n\nDemonstrators shouted slogans against Tokayev\u2019s government and Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stood down as president in 2019 after nearly three decades but who still wields considerable political and economic power behind the scenes. While many protesters were peaceful there were violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces.\n\nAs Russian troops joined a regional peacekeeping force deployment to Kazakhstan at Tokayev\u2019s request, the president ordered security forces to \u201cshoot to kill without warning\u201d to quell unrest that he blamed on foreign-trained \"terrorist groups\". There are now signs that Tokayev is moving to sweep out Nazarbayev loyalists and consolidate his own power.\n\nIn this episode of The Stream, we'll talk about what brought so many people to take to the streets in Kazakhstan and ask what happens next.\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#kazakhstan"

The Tigrayan fighters, who have been fighting federal government forces for a year, also indicated they might advance further south, on the capital, Addis Ababa.\r\nThe government said soldiers were still battling for control for the two key towns, some 400km (250 miles) from Addis Ababa.\r\nAl Jazeera's Priyanka Gupta reports.\r\n\r\n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish/\r\n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera/\r\n- Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/\r\n\r\n#Ethiopia #Tigray",

The Tigrayan fighters, who have been fighting federal government forces for a year, also indicated they might advance further south, on the capital, Addis Ababa.\r\nThe government said soldiers were still battling for control for the two key towns, some 400km (250 miles) from Addis Ababa.\r\nAl Jazeera's Priyanka Gupta reports.\r\n\r\n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish/\r\n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera/\r\n- Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/\r\n\r\n#Ethiopia #Tigray"
