These giant structures made of sticks, stones, and mud can reach heights up to 10 feet (3 meters) and lengths averaging 20 feet (6 meters) \u2014 though the biggest one ever found was significantly larger and could be seen from space. Dams completely alter the surrounding landscape, flooding the surrounding area and creating wetlands.

They\u2019re probably in you, too.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn the 1950s, the US and Canada embarked on a massive project to widen the St. Lawrence River, transforming the region to facilitate commerce, attract industry, and boost both nations\u2019 economies. But there was a third nation in the region whose people were not consulted, and whose lifestyle was completely transformed by the project: the Mohawk of Akwesasne.\n\nThe St. Lawrence River has been central to Mohawk culture in the region for thousands of years. The river\u2019s fish form the central part of their diet. But for the Mohawk, the fish aren\u2019t a \u201cresource\u201d to be used. They\u2019re an equal partner in a relationship in which both humans and wildlife have sacred responsibilities to one another. These relationships are central to the Mohawk worldview, and they mirror similar ways of understanding the natural world in other Indigenous communities.\n\nBut the bid to lure industry to the region worked.

They\u2019re probably in you, too.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn the 1950s, the US and Canada embarked on a massive project to widen the St. Lawrence River, transforming the region to facilitate commerce, attract industry, and boost both nations\u2019 economies. But there was a third nation in the region whose people were not consulted, and whose lifestyle was completely transformed by the project: the Mohawk of Akwesasne.\n\nThe St. Lawrence River has been central to Mohawk culture in the region for thousands of years. The river\u2019s fish form the central part of their diet. But for the Mohawk, the fish aren\u2019t a \u201cresource\u201d to be used. They\u2019re an equal partner in a relationship in which both humans and wildlife have sacred responsibilities to one another. These relationships are central to the Mohawk worldview, and they mirror similar ways of understanding the natural world in other Indigenous communities.\n\nBut the bid to lure industry to the region worked. Two major manufacturers built factories close to Akwesasne, and by the 1980s, the Mohawk learned that General Motors and Reynolds Metal had been poisoning the river for decades with cancer-causing chemicals called PCBs.

Many of those laws are focused in particular on the rights of transgender school children in public schools: what types of bathrooms they can use, whether their pronouns will be used, and whether they can participate in school sports. These laws are increasingly common in Republican-controlled states. Also, they may be violations of federal law.\n\nThis puts public schools in these states in a strange position: do they follow state laws that, under the Biden administration, could open them up to a federal civil rights investigation? Or do they ignore state law, and risk the state cutting their funding? Amid all that uncertainty, those who suffer most are the trans children caught up in the fight. \n\nThis video focuses on how that battle is playing out in Tennessee, the state that has introduced more anti-LGBTQ laws in 2022 than almost any other state. We looked at two of the laws that target transgender public school kids: one about bathrooms and one about participation in school sports. Those two issues have very different legal contexts, which you can read more about in the links below.\n\nFor more on the legal background of trans and nonbinary rights and bathrooms, you can read about the case of Gavin Grimm: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/us/politics/supreme-court-transgender-bathroom-rights.html\n\nFor more on transgender athletes and school sports, you can read about how Title IX will play a role: \nhttps://apnews.com/article/title-ix-transgender-athletes-rights-9adfe49a8e07f66f07b5e2302bb94730\n\nA note about the data on bullying and school attendance that compares trans, nonbinary, and cisgender students: the sample size of this study is low, covering 14 states that included a question about gender identity, and it\u2019s difficult to ascertain how many transgender students were surveyed in it: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/su/su6901a1.htm#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20although,and%20ethnicity%20data\n\nHowever, surveys by the Trevor Project point to similar findings on bullying and mental health: \nhttps://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Trevor-Project-Bullying-Research-Brief-October-2021.pdf\n\nHere is more data on mental health and transgender students in US schools: \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2021/09/13/transgender-student-rights-shouldnt-be-subject-to-partisan-feuds/\n\nEdWeek has a thorough breakdown of what\u2019s behind the push to legislate school policies, and how anti-LGBTQ laws are used as a political strategy by Republicans: \nhttps://www.edweek.org/leadership/whats-driving-the-push-to-restrict-schools-on-lgbtq-issues/2022/04\n\nFor more on the implications for the Nashville school board\u2019s decision to defy Tennessee law: \nhttps://wpln.org/post/tennessee-will-soon-be-able-to-pull-funding-from-schools-that-defy-anti-transgender-laws-where-does-that-leave-transgender-youth/\n\nChapters\nState law vs. federal law: 00:00\nTennessee\u2019s anti-trans laws: 2:02\nWho controls public schools?: 4:22\nLegal limbo: 6:21\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "A civil rights battle with transgender kids caught in the middle.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn recent years, state legislatures in the US have introduced hundreds of bills targeting the rights of LGBTQ Americans. Many of those laws are focused in particular on the rights of transgender school children in public schools: what types of bathrooms they can use, whether their pronouns will be used, and whether they can participate in school sports. These laws are increasingly common in Republican-controlled states. Also, they may be violations of federal law.\n\nThis puts public schools in these states in a strange position: do they follow state laws that, under the Biden administration, could open them up to a federal civil rights investigation? Or do they ignore state law, and risk the state cutting their funding? Amid all that uncertainty, those who suffer most are the trans children caught up in the fight. \n\nThis video focuses on how that battle is playing out in Tennessee, the state that has introduced more anti-LGBTQ laws in 2022 than almost any other state. We looked at two of the laws that target transgender public school kids: one about bathrooms and one about participation in school sports. Those two issues have very different legal contexts, which you can read more about in the links below.\n\nFor more on the legal background of trans and nonbinary rights and bathrooms, you can read about the case of Gavin Grimm: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/us/politics/supreme-court-transgender-bathroom-rights.html\n\nFor more on transgender athletes and school sports, you can read about how Title IX will play a role: \nhttps://apnews.com/article/title-ix-transgender-athletes-rights-9adfe49a8e07f66f07b5e2302bb94730\n\nA note about the data on bullying and school attendance that compares trans, nonbinary, and cisgender students: the sample size of this study is low, covering 14 states that included a question about gender identity, and it\u2019s difficult to ascertain how many transgender students were surveyed in it: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/su/su6901a1.htm#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20although,and%20ethnicity%20data\n\nHowever, surveys by the Trevor Project point to similar findings on bullying and mental health: \nhttps://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Trevor-Project-Bullying-Research-Brief-October-2021.pdf\n\nHere is more data on mental health and transgender students in US schools: \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2021/09/13/transgender-student-rights-shouldnt-be-subject-to-partisan-feuds/\n\nEdWeek has a thorough breakdown of what\u2019s behind the push to legislate school policies, and how anti-LGBTQ laws are used as a political strategy by Republicans: \nhttps://www.edweek.org/leadership/whats-driving-the-push-to-restrict-schools-on-lgbtq-issues/2022/04\n\nFor more on the implications for the Nashville school board\u2019s decision to defy Tennessee law: \nhttps://wpln.org/post/tennessee-will-soon-be-able-to-pull-funding-from-schools-that-defy-anti-transgender-laws-where-does-that-leave-transgender-youth/\n\nChapters\nState law vs. federal law: 00:00\nTennessee\u2019s anti-trans laws: 2:02\nWho controls public schools?: 4:22\nLegal limbo: 6:21\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

According to Merzenich, \u201cpeople who travel to new places, keep learning languages, and continue to experience new things into old age, are far less likely to develop cognitive decay.\u201d\n\nBuilding on that theme, \u201ctravel and having new experiences, in general, is very beneficial for creativity because the more bits of information that you have, the more learning that you have,\u201d says Dr. Shelley Carson, author of \u201cYour Creative Brain: Seven Steps to Maximize Imagination, Productivity, and Innovation in Your Life.\u201d To be more creative, a person needs to learn new things constantly. \u201cTravel is one of the ways to constantly be learning because travel is full of new experiences, new stimuli, that\u2019s just going to pack your brain full of new information,\u201d says Dr. Carson.\n\nWherever your journey takes you, explore Marriott Bonvoy properties around the world at https://www.marriott.com/loyalty/where-can-we-take-you.mi.

Wade future.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn 2008, researchers with the University of California San Francisco embarked on a study that compared the outcomes of two similar groups of women, each at a crucial juncture in their lives: a visit to an abortion clinic. The groups differed, though, in whether or not they were able to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. It was called the Turnaway Study, named for those who were turned away by the clinic because their pregnancies were past legal gestational limits, and it provides some of the best data we have on the impacts of abortion bans. \n\nAmong the study\u2019s findings is the severe financial impact of being forced to parent a new child when someone is already living in difficult financial circumstances. People who seek abortions, especially later-term abortions, are far more likely than the general population to be living in poverty, or otherwise financially unstable. That fact makes it unsurprising that, when researchers asked women about their reasons for seeking an abortion, not being financially prepared was the most common reason. This video offers a glimpse into the financial penalty of parenting under difficult circumstances. \n\nWe interviewed several women who had similar experiences to the women in the study. We didn\u2019t seek out interviewees who exactly reflected the circumstances of the study participants (i.e., the length of gestation when they sought an abortion, or their socioeconomic background) but their stories reveal some parallels: most people want an abortion because they don\u2019t feel financially stable or don\u2019t have a partner they want to co-parent with. \n\nThe Turnaway Study also looked at mental health outcomes, relationship outcomes, and whether or not study participants chose adoption instead of parenting. Whether or not they chose adoption is relevant to common pro-life rhetoric, which encourages people to give unwanted children up for adoption rather than choose abortion. But the Turnaway Study found that 91% of women who were denied an abortion chose to parent, which indicates that adoption is not a feasible alternative for most people. We interviewed Gretchen Sisson, a researcher who looked at adoption rates and motivations among the Turnaway Study participants. \n\nFor more coverage of the Turnaway Study: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/magazine/study-women-denied-abortions.html?_r=0\n\nFor lead Turnaway Study researcher Diana Greene Foster\u2019s book about her study:\nhttps://bookshop.org/books/the-turnaway-study-ten-years-a-thousand-women-and-the-consequences-of-having-or-being-denied-an-abortion-9781982141578/9781982141561\n\nFor links to further research using Turnaway Study data: \nhttps://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/turnawaystudyannotatedbibliography.pdf\n\nFor Gretchen Sisson\u2019s work on adoption: \nhttps://www.whijournal.com/article/S1049-3867(16)30348-6/fulltext\n\nWe also interviewed Katie Woodruff, who analyzed news coverage of abortion: \nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30309695/\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Imagen, explained.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nBeginning in January 2021, advances in AI research have produced a plethora of deep-learning models capable of generating original images from simple text prompts, effectively extending the human imagination. Researchers at OpenAI, Google, Facebook, and others have developed text-to-image tools that they have not yet released to the public, and similar models have proliferated online in the open-source arena and at smaller companies like Midjourney.\n\nThese tools represent a massive cultural shift because they remove the requirement for technical labor from the process of image-making. Instead, they select for creative ideation, skillful use of language, and curatorial taste. The ultimate consequences are difficult to predict, but \u2014 like the invention of the camera, and the digital camera thereafter \u2014 these algorithms herald a new, democratized form of expression that will commence another explosion in the volume of imagery produced by humans. But, like other automated systems trained on historical data and internet images, they also come with risks that have not been resolved. \n\nThe video above is a primer on how we got here, how this technology works, and some of the implications.

DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Imagen, explained.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nBeginning in January 2021, advances in AI research have produced a plethora of deep-learning models capable of generating original images from simple text prompts, effectively extending the human imagination. Researchers at OpenAI, Google, Facebook, and others have developed text-to-image tools that they have not yet released to the public, and similar models have proliferated online in the open-source arena and at smaller companies like Midjourney.\n\nThese tools represent a massive cultural shift because they remove the requirement for technical labor from the process of image-making. Instead, they select for creative ideation, skillful use of language, and curatorial taste. The ultimate consequences are difficult to predict, but \u2014 like the invention of the camera, and the digital camera thereafter \u2014 these algorithms herald a new, democratized form of expression that will commence another explosion in the volume of imagery produced by humans. But, like other automated systems trained on historical data and internet images, they also come with risks that have not been resolved. \n\nThe video above is a primer on how we got here, how this technology works, and some of the implications.

We had to find out who.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nDeep in the Sahara, far from any towns, roads, or other signs of life, is a row of markings in the sand. There are dozens of them stretching for miles in a straight line in central Algeria, each consisting of a central point surrounded by a circle of 12 nodes, like numbers on a clock. And when we started making this video, no one seemed to know what they were. \n\nWe first saw the circles back in September 2021, after finding a Reddit post on r/WhatIsThis with coordinates asking what the circles could be. With just two upvotes and two commenters, it wasn\u2019t exactly a lively discussion. But seeing the circles themselves on Google Earth was fascinating: They were eerily perfect in their shape and regularity, but so deeply isolated in the desert. We were hooked on finding an answer. \n\nSo we decided to make a video out of trying to solve the mystery, no matter where it took us. We documented every step of the process \u2014 from Zoom calls and web browser screen recordings to vlogs and field shoots \u2014 to show the reporting process from the inside out. And when we maxed out what we could learn on the internet, we handed over this story to a team in Algeria to take it all the way. \n\nResources: \n\nCheck out the circles for yourself: https://www.google.com/maps/@27.270129,4.3221894,251m/data=!3m1!1e3\n\nRead Will K\u2019s original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Whatisthis/comments/nv4ysr/ive_just_discovered_unexplained_and_undocumented/\n\nHere\u2019s the 1885 document that Melissa found: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.2307/495986\n\nRead Dale Lightfoot on the sustainability of qanats: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12685-017-0200-7\n\nMy interview with Marta Musso didn\u2019t make the final cut, but you can check out her work on the history of the hydrocarbon industry and Algerian decolonization: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1mtz521.8?seq=1\n\nI also spoke to Roberto Cantoni, who wrote a great book that covers the same history: https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9781315531533-4/oil-diplomacy-wartime-algeria-roberto-cantoni\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

There are dozens of them stretching for miles in a straight line in central Algeria, each consisting of a central point surrounded by a circle of 12 nodes, like numbers on a clock. And when we started making this video, no one seemed to know what they were. \n\nWe first saw the circles back in September 2021, after finding a Reddit post on r/WhatIsThis with coordinates asking what the circles could be. With just two upvotes and two commenters, it wasn\u2019t exactly a lively discussion. But seeing the circles themselves on Google Earth was fascinating: They were eerily perfect in their shape and regularity, but so deeply isolated in the desert. We were hooked on finding an answer. \n\nSo we decided to make a video out of trying to solve the mystery, no matter where it took us. We documented every step of the process \u2014 from Zoom calls and web browser screen recordings to vlogs and field shoots \u2014 to show the reporting process from the inside out. And when we maxed out what we could learn on the internet, we handed over this story to a team in Algeria to take it all the way. \n\nResources: \n\nCheck out the circles for yourself: https://www.google.com/maps/@27.270129,4.3221894,251m/data=!3m1!1e3\n\nRead Will K\u2019s original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Whatisthis/comments/nv4ysr/ive_just_discovered_unexplained_and_undocumented/\n\nHere\u2019s the 1885 document that Melissa found: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.2307/495986\n\nRead Dale Lightfoot on the sustainability of qanats: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12685-017-0200-7\n\nMy interview with Marta Musso didn\u2019t make the final cut, but you can check out her work on the history of the hydrocarbon industry and Algerian decolonization: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1mtz521.8?seq=1\n\nI also spoke to Roberto Cantoni, who wrote a great book that covers the same history: https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9781315531533-4/oil-diplomacy-wartime-algeria-roberto-cantoni\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                "description": "The letter now signifies loyalty to the Russian president.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nRussian gymnast Ivan Kuliak caused controversy in March 2022 when he accepted a bronze medal at a World Cup event, all while sporting a taped-on letter \u201cZ\u201d on his uniform. The Z symbol had already been appearing all over Russia, as a sign of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and loyalty to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter popped up on merchandise, in highly organized flash mobs that often involved children, at pro-war rallies, and in internet memes.\n\nThe symbol was originally spotted on Russian tanks and trucks building up at Ukraine\u2019s border in late February, along with other letters like V and O. Questions about what the symbols meant began circulating online, and once the invasion began on February 24, most analysts agreed the markings were likely for tactical purposes.\n\nBut as intrigue around them grew, the Russian Defense Ministry seized on the opportunity to claim that the letters carry extra meaning. They began generating memes that incorporated the Z and V into propaganda slogans. Those letters don\u2019t appear in Russia\u2019s Cyrillic alphabet, so some of the memes Latinize them: most common are ones that begin with the word \u201cfor\u201d \u2014 spelled \u201c\u0417a\u201d in Russian, but Latinized to \u201cZa\u201d for the memes. \n\nAnother way Putin\u2019s regime has turned Z into a propaganda meme has been by connecting it with the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The \u201cGreat Patriotic War\u201d maintains a significant presence in Russian culture \u2014 the anniversary of Germany\u2019s defeat is celebrated each year on May 9, or \"Victory Day,\" and World War II imagery is heavily associated with Russian patriotism and national pride. Z memes that incorporate old photos of Soviet soldiers \u2014 and the recognizable orange and black stripes of the Ribbon of St. George \u2014 are an attempt to equate the current war in Ukraine with World War II. \n\nThe Z has spread beyond Russia, too. It\u2019s now seen in pro-Russian demonstrations worldwide and is banned in a growing list of countries. The Z\u2019s evolution from tactical markings on invasion vehicles to a global pro-war symbol demonstrates the effectiveness of the Putin regime\u2019s propaganda strategies.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this video showed a photo at 4:06 of graffiti in Vologograd which depicted a satirical use of \"Z\" slogans. We have changed the image to a graffitied \"Z\" in St. Petersburg instead. \n\n\u201cZ\u201d Is the Symbol of the New Russian Politics of Aggression, by Masha Gessen:\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/z-is-the-symbol-of-the-new-russian-politics-of-aggression\n\n\u2018Z\u2019 How Russia transformed a letter of the Latin alphabet into the official (and ominous) symbol of its invasion of Ukraine, by Alexey Kovalev and Meduza:\nhttps://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/03/16/z\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "The letter now signifies loyalty to the Russian president.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nRussian gymnast Ivan Kuliak caused controversy in March 2022 when he accepted a bronze medal at a World Cup event, all while sporting a taped-on letter \u201cZ\u201d on his uniform. The Z symbol had already been appearing all over Russia, as a sign of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and loyalty to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter popped up on merchandise, in highly organized flash mobs that often involved children, at pro-war rallies, and in internet memes.\n\nThe symbol was originally spotted on Russian tanks and trucks building up at Ukraine\u2019s border in late February, along with other letters like V and O. Questions about what the symbols meant began circulating online, and once the invasion began on February 24, most analysts agreed the markings were likely for tactical purposes.\n\nBut as intrigue around them grew, the Russian Defense Ministry seized on the opportunity to claim that the letters carry extra meaning. They began generating memes that incorporated the Z and V into propaganda slogans. Those letters don\u2019t appear in Russia\u2019s Cyrillic alphabet, so some of the memes Latinize them: most common are ones that begin with the word \u201cfor\u201d \u2014 spelled \u201c\u0417a\u201d in Russian, but Latinized to \u201cZa\u201d for the memes. \n\nAnother way Putin\u2019s regime has turned Z into a propaganda meme has been by connecting it with the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The \u201cGreat Patriotic War\u201d maintains a significant presence in Russian culture \u2014 the anniversary of Germany\u2019s defeat is celebrated each year on May 9, or \"Victory Day,\" and World War II imagery is heavily associated with Russian patriotism and national pride. Z memes that incorporate old photos of Soviet soldiers \u2014 and the recognizable orange and black stripes of the Ribbon of St. George \u2014 are an attempt to equate the current war in Ukraine with World War II. \n\nThe Z has spread beyond Russia, too. It\u2019s now seen in pro-Russian demonstrations worldwide and is banned in a growing list of countries. The Z\u2019s evolution from tactical markings on invasion vehicles to a global pro-war symbol demonstrates the effectiveness of the Putin regime\u2019s propaganda strategies.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this video showed a photo at 4:06 of graffiti in Vologograd which depicted a satirical use of \"Z\" slogans. We have changed the image to a graffitied \"Z\" in St. Petersburg instead. \n\n\u201cZ\u201d Is the Symbol of the New Russian Politics of Aggression, by Masha Gessen:\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/z-is-the-symbol-of-the-new-russian-politics-of-aggression\n\n\u2018Z\u2019 How Russia transformed a letter of the Latin alphabet into the official (and ominous) symbol of its invasion of Ukraine, by Alexey Kovalev and Meduza:\nhttps://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/03/16/z\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It\u2019s been home to astronauts from more than a dozen different countries \u2014 but mostly Americans and Russians. The two former \u201cSpace Race\u201d countries control the main parts of the station. The science done there has required close collaboration and so it\u2019s been largely insulated from politics on Earth.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine may change that. The two countries have agreed to cooperate through 2024\u2026 but after that, the future of the space station is uncertain. \n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

What went wrong?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nWhy aren\u2019t homes made of steel? In the late 1940s, one company posed that question. Lustron was a prefabricated home that was supposed to be the future of housing. So why did it fail?\n\nFor just a few years \u2014 1947 to 1950 \u2014 the Columbus, Ohio-based Lustron represented the future of housing. Using a steel frame and porcelain enamel-covered steel panels, Lustron made homes in a factory and shipped them around the country.\n\nVox\u2019s Phil Edwards visited a Lustron home just outside Dayton, Ohio, to experience the unusual features, like magnetic walls, for himself. This home\u2019s quirks weren\u2019t relegated to the materials. Through a combination of government funding sources, an attempt to reinvent the production cycle for home, and a unique distribution plan, the Lustron home helps explain how housing does \u2014 and doesn\u2019t \u2014 work in America.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Lustron-Home-History-Prefabricated-Experiment/dp/0786426551\nTom Fetters\u2019s book, The Lustron Home, is packed full of charts, graphs, original letters, and a clear and concise history of the company\u2019s successes and failures.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/SUBURBAN-STEEL-MAGNIFICENT-FAILURE-LANDSCAPE/dp/0814252737\nSuburban Steel, Douglas Knerr\u2019s look at Lustron, covers similar ground, but with more of an eye toward government drama and the complexities of public funding for a private business.\n\nhttps://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/exhibits/ohio-history-center-exhibits/1950s-building-the-american-dream/lustron-about/lustron-library/erection-manual\nLocated in Columbus, the Ohio History Connection has a reconstructed Lustron as an exhibit. They also have online resources including the linked instruction manual.\n\nhttps://whitehallhistoricalsociety.weebly.com/lustron.html\nThe Whitehall Historical society writes here about their reconstruction of a Lustron home.\n\nIf you want to stay in a Lustron, you can. These are just a few of the Lustrons available on vacation sites like Airbnb and VRBO (including Barbara Rose\u2019s home in West Alexandria).\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4832937\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21647262\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/41822136\nhttps://www.vrbo.com/1375987\nhttps://www.vrbo.com/432058\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/44593287\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

What went wrong?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nWhy aren\u2019t homes made of steel? In the late 1940s, one company posed that question. Lustron was a prefabricated home that was supposed to be the future of housing. So why did it fail?\n\nFor just a few years \u2014 1947 to 1950 \u2014 the Columbus, Ohio-based Lustron represented the future of housing. Using a steel frame and porcelain enamel-covered steel panels, Lustron made homes in a factory and shipped them around the country.\n\nVox\u2019s Phil Edwards visited a Lustron home just outside Dayton, Ohio, to experience the unusual features, like magnetic walls, for himself. This home\u2019s quirks weren\u2019t relegated to the materials. Through a combination of government funding sources, an attempt to reinvent the production cycle for home, and a unique distribution plan, the Lustron home helps explain how housing does \u2014 and doesn\u2019t \u2014 work in America.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Lustron-Home-History-Prefabricated-Experiment/dp/0786426551\nTom Fetters\u2019s book, The Lustron Home, is packed full of charts, graphs, original letters, and a clear and concise history of the company\u2019s successes and failures.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/SUBURBAN-STEEL-MAGNIFICENT-FAILURE-LANDSCAPE/dp/0814252737\nSuburban Steel, Douglas Knerr\u2019s look at Lustron, covers similar ground, but with more of an eye toward government drama and the complexities of public funding for a private business.\n\nhttps://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/exhibits/ohio-history-center-exhibits/1950s-building-the-american-dream/lustron-about/lustron-library/erection-manual\nLocated in Columbus, the Ohio History Connection has a reconstructed Lustron as an exhibit. They also have online resources including the linked instruction manual.\n\nhttps://whitehallhistoricalsociety.weebly.com/lustron.html\nThe Whitehall Historical society writes here about their reconstruction of a Lustron home.\n\nIf you want to stay in a Lustron, you can. These are just a few of the Lustrons available on vacation sites like Airbnb and VRBO (including Barbara Rose\u2019s home in West Alexandria).\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4832937\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21647262\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/41822136\nhttps://www.vrbo.com/1375987\nhttps://www.vrbo.com/432058\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/44593287\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Since then, superheroes and digidoubles have gone hand in hand. Protagonists in superhero films often wear masks or skin-tight bodysuits, which makes them perfect candidates for digital replacement; fabric is way easier to replicate digitally than skin.  \n\nTechnology has only improved over the years, which means digidoubles are used for so much more than just \u201csuper\u201d sequences. Today, digidoubles are used to give filmmakers and artists flexibility. Instead of being locked into what they\u2019re able to shoot during principal photography, they can add and remove shots, completely change characters' costumes, and rewrite the script if they need to \u2014 long after filming is over.\n\nThe video above breaks down some surprising uses of digidoubles in superhero movies \u2014 and shows just how often they appear in modern movies. \n\nCorrection: At 6:18, we mistakenly labeled Avengers: Infinity War as Avengers: Endgame.  \n\nFurther reading:\nThe Verge: \"That massive airport fight in Captain America: Civil War was almost entirely digital\" https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/12/11664554/captain-america-civil-war-cgi-visual-effects-spider-man-interview\n\nVFX Futures Podcast\" Looking back on the digital human breakthroughs in Spider-Man 2 https://beforesandafters.com/2021/12/21/vfx-futures-vfx-supervisor-scott-stokdyk-looks-back-on-the-digital-human-breakthroughs-in-spider-man-2/\n\nRodeo FX: Breaking down the breakdown on Shang-Chi shows how digidoubles get integrated on a recent Marvel film https://vimeo.com/663434886\n\nBefores and Afters: When you have to craft not 1 Spider-Man but 3 https://beforesandafters.com/2022/01/24/when-you-have-to-craft-not-one-spider-man-but-three/\n\nImageworks VFX: Spider-Man Homecoming digidouble breakdowns https://www.imageworks.com/our-craft/vfx/movies/spider-man-homecoming\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Since then, superheroes and digidoubles have gone hand in hand. Protagonists in superhero films often wear masks or skin-tight bodysuits, which makes them perfect candidates for digital replacement; fabric is way easier to replicate digitally than skin.  \n\nTechnology has only improved over the years, which means digidoubles are used for so much more than just \u201csuper\u201d sequences. Today, digidoubles are used to give filmmakers and artists flexibility. Instead of being locked into what they\u2019re able to shoot during principal photography, they can add and remove shots, completely change characters' costumes, and rewrite the script if they need to \u2014 long after filming is over.\n\nThe video above breaks down some surprising uses of digidoubles in superhero movies \u2014 and shows just how often they appear in modern movies. \n\nCorrection: At 6:18, we mistakenly labeled Avengers: Infinity War as Avengers: Endgame.  \n\nFurther reading:\nThe Verge: \"That massive airport fight in Captain America: Civil War was almost entirely digital\" https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/12/11664554/captain-america-civil-war-cgi-visual-effects-spider-man-interview\n\nVFX Futures Podcast\" Looking back on the digital human breakthroughs in Spider-Man 2 https://beforesandafters.com/2021/12/21/vfx-futures-vfx-supervisor-scott-stokdyk-looks-back-on-the-digital-human-breakthroughs-in-spider-man-2/\n\nRodeo FX: Breaking down the breakdown on Shang-Chi shows how digidoubles get integrated on a recent Marvel film https://vimeo.com/663434886\n\nBefores and Afters: When you have to craft not 1 Spider-Man but 3 https://beforesandafters.com/2022/01/24/when-you-have-to-craft-not-one-spider-man-but-three/\n\nImageworks VFX: Spider-Man Homecoming digidouble breakdowns https://www.imageworks.com/our-craft/vfx/movies/spider-man-homecoming\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

So is it actually safe to take off the masks for good?  \n\nIt depends on who you are and where you are.

For two years we\u2019ve largely relied on local governments and businesses to tell us when and where to wear them, but now those mandates are being lifted. So is it actually safe to take off the masks for good?  \n\nIt depends on who you are and where you are. Cases are dropping in many places around the world after a harsh omicron surge, but some countries are still fighting off deadly waves of the virus. Many public health experts are warning that the pandemic isn\u2019t over yet, even if it feels like it is to some of us. It\u2019s a good idea to hang onto your mask for now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to wear it every day for the rest of your life, just that you should take a few key things into consideration.

Within two years, he had already navigated scandals like his offshore companies appearing in the Pandora Papers and struggled to fulfill his campaign pledge to end the war against Russia in the Donbas region of Ukraine.\n\nBut the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, found him extremely well-positioned to offer his skills in performance and storytelling to motivate Ukrainians, rally Europe, and undermine Putin\u2019s propaganda.

Within two years, he had already navigated scandals like his offshore companies appearing in the Pandora Papers and struggled to fulfill his campaign pledge to end the war against Russia in the Donbas region of Ukraine.\n\nBut the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, found him extremely well-positioned to offer his skills in performance and storytelling to motivate Ukrainians, rally Europe, and undermine Putin\u2019s propaganda. How will his reaction to Russia\u2019s advances affect his legacy?\n\nWe chose 8 clips that we feel explain President Zelenskyy\u2019s rise from a comedian to the leader of Ukraine and had journalists and experts respond.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nSimon Shuster, reporter at Time Magazine, interviewed in the video above, wrote a profile on President Zelenskyy: https://time.com/6154139/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-profile-russia/\n\nFor more information on how social media shaped Zelenskyy\u2019s victory in Ukraine, check out this piece by Maryana Drach: https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-08/RISJ_Final%20Report_Maryana%20Drach_2020_Final%202%20%289%29.pdf\n\nMykhailo Minakov, expert at the Wilson Center, and featured in the video above, wrote an analysis on Zelenskyy\u2019s decline in popularity and the failures of his presidency\nhttps://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/just-all-others-end-zelensky-alternative\n \nHow Zelenskyy downplayed the war in January:\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/28/ukrainian-president-downplays-imminent-invasion-00003219\n\nListen to this episode of Vox's podcast Today, Explained on Zelenskyy: https://open.spotify.com/episode/05EqniD8MPKNGaBSf9LXSw?si=d4e50a3662d74e96\n\nUnderstand Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, explained here: https://youtu.be/MVu8QbxafJE \n\nStay up to date on our reporting of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, here: https://bit.ly/3sSEJwT \n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Although the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines haven\u2019t been able to stop transmission of the virus, they have been highly effective against hospitalization and death, saving hundreds of thousands of lives and rendering the majority of new Covid-19 deaths preventable.\n\nTrump has received three doses of the vaccine. But many of his most dedicated supporters have refused, and many have died as a result. Why? Obvious culprits include misinformation on social media and Fox News and the election of Joe Biden, which placed a Democrat at the top of the US government throughout the vaccine distribution period. But if you look closely at the data, you\u2019ll see that vaccine-hesitant conservatives largely made up their mind well before the vaccines were available and before Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. \n\nTo understand why, I took a deep dive into the data, interviewed researchers, and spoke to people who lost loved ones to preventable severe Covid-19 infections. What I found is a stark cautionary tale for the country and for Republican political elites. Partisan polarization takes on a life of its own; once set into motion it\u2019s nearly impossible to stop, even when the fallout is immense and irreparable.\n\nAccepting donations in memory of Philly Baird and Phil Valentine:\nhttps://phillybairdisthechange.org/ \nhttps://nashvillerescuemission.org/mission-in-my-words-phil-valentine/ \n\nSources:\nhttps://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Sex-and-Age/9bhg-hcku \nhttps://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc \nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status \nhttps://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/3rge-nu2a \nhttps://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-january-2022/ \nhttps://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX \nhttps://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/reuters-ipso\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/07/more-americans-now-see-very-high-preventive-health-benefits-from-measles-vaccine/ \nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/01/24/democrats-report-much-higher-levels-of-trust-in-a-number-of-news-sources-than-republicans/\nhttps://www.kff.org/report-section/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-january-2021-sources-of-information/ \nhttps://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-media-and-misinformation/\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/27-vaccinated-coronavirus-republicans-conservatives-poll/story?id=70962377  \nhttps://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/importance-of-partisanship-predicting-vaccination-status/ \nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/27/attention-to-covid-19-news-increased-slightly-amid-omicron-surge-partisans-differ-in-views-about-the-outbreak/ft_2022-01-27_covidnews_03/ \nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250123 \nhttps://www.pascl.stanford.edu/ \nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/05/1059828993/data-vaccine-misinformation-trump-counties-covid-death-rate\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/briefing/covid-death-toll-red-america.html\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Although the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines haven\u2019t been able to stop transmission of the virus, they have been highly effective against hospitalization and death, saving hundreds of thousands of lives and rendering the majority of new Covid-19 deaths preventable.\n\nTrump has received three doses of the vaccine. But many of his most dedicated supporters have refused, and many have died as a result. Why? Obvious culprits include misinformation on social media and Fox News and the election of Joe Biden, which placed a Democrat at the top of the US government throughout the vaccine distribution period. But if you look closely at the data, you\u2019ll see that vaccine-hesitant conservatives largely made up their mind well before the vaccines were available and before Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. \n\nTo understand why, I took a deep dive into the data, interviewed researchers, and spoke to people who lost loved ones to preventable severe Covid-19 infections.

For centuries, the watershed line (which marks the divide where water flows either north or south off of the mountains) served as a natural boundary between Italy and its European neighbors.

Their solution might prove crucial as climate change reshapes water-based borders around the world.\n\nCorrection: the watershed line at 00:41 was mislabeled and drawn incorrectly.

We\u2019ve fixed the error to reflect the correct watershed boundaries.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nBefore the book, Marco debuted an interactive installation at the Venice Biennale called \u201cItalian Limes\u201d \u2014 Limes is Latin for boundary\u00a0\u2014 with a GPS-powered drawing machine that traced the shifting border in real time:\nhttp://www.italianlimes.net/\n \nRead more about Marco, Elisa, and Andrea\u2019s book here: https://www.arch.columbia.edu/books/catalog/369-a-moving-border-alpine-cartographies-of-climate-change\n\nThe historical maps we projected are from swisstopo, Switzerland's national mapping agency. They have a great interactive map tool you can check out here: https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=en&topic=swisstopo&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&layers_timestamp=19691231,&zoom=8&E=2620551.74&N=1088893.78&layers=ch.swisstopo.zeitreihen,ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-land-flaeche.fill&time=1969&catalogNodes=1430\n\nAnd read more from swisstopo about the border changes:\nhttps://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/knowledge-facts/sovereign-border/national-boundary/moving-boundaries.html\n\nThis New Yorker piece by Zoey Poll is a beautiful deep dive into the story of the Rifugio: https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-europe/the-uncertain-fate-of-an-alpine-mountain-lodge\n\nAnd so is this Wall Street Journal story by Eric Sylvers: https://www.wsj.com/articles/italys-alpine-border-melts-and-leaves-a-pasta-restaurant-in-switzerlandmaybe-11582134089\n\nLastly, hear from the owner of the Rifugio himself \u2014\u00a0and how the border line uncertainty is affecting his restaurant renovation plans: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4KK1FbYb6w\n\nThis is the fourth of our themed videos for winter sports week at Vox.

Behind the superhuman turns and sprints are calculated moves to control the pack. \n\nApolo Ohno is probably being humble when he says that he was not the fastest skater when he entered the 500m short track finals at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. But he makes that claim to emphasize the strategy \u2014 and the little bit of luck \u2014 that played into that gold medal win. That\u2019s why he has always referred to that event as the \u201cperfect race\u201d in short track speed skating.  \n\nI learned a lot from retired US Olympic speed skater John Coyle\u2019s website, and I interviewed John for this story.\nhttps://johnkcoyle.com/blog/2010/02/13/vancouver-journal-7-an-introduction-to-short-track-speedskating\n\nI also learned a lot from former US Olympic speed skating coach Sue Ellis\u2019s website:\nhttp://www.ellismethod.net/\n\nThe New York Times covered the way short track speed skaters bodies are shaped, because of the constant counterclockwise turns: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/sports/olympics/short-track-speed-skaters.html?searchResultPosition=6\n\nRetired Australian speed skater Steven Bradbury spun off his unlikely gold medal win into both a book and a beer company by the name of  \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d: \nhttps://lmsbrewing.com.a\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/Steven_Bradbury.html?id=V2s8AAAACAAJ\n\nI interviewed physics professor Rhett Allain about the physics of short track speed skating.

Behind the superhuman turns and sprints are calculated moves to control the pack. \n\nApolo Ohno is probably being humble when he says that he was not the fastest skater when he entered the 500m short track finals at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. But he makes that claim to emphasize the strategy \u2014 and the little bit of luck \u2014 that played into that gold medal win. That\u2019s why he has always referred to that event as the \u201cperfect race\u201d in short track speed skating.  \n\nI learned a lot from retired US Olympic speed skater John Coyle\u2019s website, and I interviewed John for this story.\nhttps://johnkcoyle.com/blog/2010/02/13/vancouver-journal-7-an-introduction-to-short-track-speedskating\n\nI also learned a lot from former US Olympic speed skating coach Sue Ellis\u2019s website:\nhttp://www.ellismethod.net/\n\nThe New York Times covered the way short track speed skaters bodies are shaped, because of the constant counterclockwise turns: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/sports/olympics/short-track-speed-skaters.html?searchResultPosition=6\n\nRetired Australian speed skater Steven Bradbury spun off his unlikely gold medal win into both a book and a beer company by the name of  \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d: \nhttps://lmsbrewing.com.a\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/Steven_Bradbury.html?id=V2s8AAAACAAJ\n\nI interviewed physics professor Rhett Allain about the physics of short track speed skating. He has written for Wired about the sport: \nhttps://www.wired.com/2014/02/fast-can-skater-turn-speed-skating-short-track/\n\nThis is the second video of 5 videos from our channel's winter sports theme week.

Keeping the body in a straight line like this was considered elegant and appealing. But more importantly, it was the position jumpers used to gather as much distance as possible. This position made athletes thin and small, which allowed them to move forward through the air quickly.

He noticed that the V shape allowed him to achieve longer distances.\n\nThat\u2019s because, unlike the parallel position, the V position allows air to hit athletes' bodies directly. Instead of cutting through the air quickly, they\u2019re using their body to catch air like a wing. This extra air lifts athletes up, allowing them to stay airborne longer \u2014 and go further.

This technology also coincided with a new religious movement becoming popular in the US and Europe: spiritualism. Spiritualists believed that, through the use of a medium, contact with the dead was possible. During the bloody American Civil War (1861-1865), belief in Spiritualism grew.\n\nIt was during this time that William Mumler, an amateur photographer in Boston, claimed he could photograph ghosts. He and his wife Hannah, herself a professional photographer and Spiritualist medium, created a stir in Boston by selling these \"spirit portraits,\" and attracted the attention of Spiritualists and skeptics alike. Professional photographers in Boston investigated Mumler's method again and again but couldn't figure out how he did his trick.\n\nAfter accusations of fraud piled up in Boston, the Mumler\u2019s relocated to New York City, the photographic capital of the US. Here, Mumler was quickly arrested on fraud charges, and his trial was sensationalized in New York newspapers. The prosecution even brought in circus showman P.T. Barnum to testify against Mumler. But, like the photographers in Boston, no one could confidently identify his method \u2014 and Mumler was acquitted.\n\nOnce the trial was over, the Mumlers' spirit photography business boomed. They photographed prominent Americans, including Mary Todd Lincoln and William Lloyd Garrison, and even took mail-in orders from people who couldn't visit their studio in Boston. We visited photographic process historian Mark Osterman to demonstrate how Mumler could have used two negatives, printed simultaneously with a bit of sleight of hand, to fool witnesses into believing his \"ghosts\" were the real thing.\n\nOur director of photography in Annapolis, Maryland, was Colin Faust.\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story.

                    "description": "William Mumler claimed he could photograph ghosts ... and no one could prove he couldn\u2019t.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn the mid-1800s, the development of exciting new forms of communication, like photography and the telegraph, was considered miraculous. This technology also coincided with a new religious movement becoming popular in the US and Europe: spiritualism. Spiritualists believed that, through the use of a medium, contact with the dead was possible. During the bloody American Civil War (1861-1865), belief in Spiritualism grew.\n\nIt was during this time that William Mumler, an amateur photographer in Boston, claimed he could photograph ghosts. He and his wife Hannah, herself a professional photographer and Spiritualist medium, created a stir in Boston by selling these \"spirit portraits,\" and attracted the attention of Spiritualists and skeptics alike. Professional photographers in Boston investigated Mumler's method again and again but couldn't figure out how he did his trick.\n\nAfter accusations of fraud piled up in Boston, the Mumler\u2019s relocated to New York City, the photographic capital of the US. Here, Mumler was quickly arrested on fraud charges, and his trial was sensationalized in New York newspapers. The prosecution even brought in circus showman P.T. Barnum to testify against Mumler. But, like the photographers in Boston, no one could confidently identify his method \u2014 and Mumler was acquitted.\n\nOnce the trial was over, the Mumlers' spirit photography business boomed. They photographed prominent Americans, including Mary Todd Lincoln and William Lloyd Garrison, and even took mail-in orders from people who couldn't visit their studio in Boston. We visited photographic process historian Mark Osterman to demonstrate how Mumler could have used two negatives, printed simultaneously with a bit of sleight of hand, to fool witnesses into believing his \"ghosts\" were the real thing.\n\nOur director of photography in Annapolis, Maryland, was Colin Faust.\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story.

It was the most distant world humans had ever seen. Decades later, even the powerful Hubble Space Telescope struggled to get a good look at the dwarf planet \u2013 the Hubble image of Pluto is just a sickly yellow smudge (https://esahubble.org/images/opo1006h/). \n\nSo when astronomers set out to search for planets around other stars (aka \u201cexoplanets), they knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy. Our closest neighbor, a little red dwarf named Proxima Centauri, is 7,000 times further away from us than Pluto. Any planets in orbit around it would likely get lost in the glare of bright starlight.\n\n\u201cTrying to see an earthlike planet across interstellar distances,\u201d writes astrophysicist Adam Frank, \u201cwould be like looking from New York City to AT&T Park in San Francisco, where the Giants play, and making out a firefly next to one of the stadium spotlights.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo detect or study an exoplanet,\u201d says Sara Seager, a planet-hunting astrophysicist at MIT, \u201cwe have to work with the star.\u201d\n\nAstronomers started monitoring stars for tiny changes that could hint at the presence of one or more planets. Early efforts focused on the search for a wobble. The pull of a planet\u2019s gravity causes a star to circle their mutual center of gravity - and from our vantage point the star seems to swing back and forth. In 1995, a Swiss team picked up the signature of just such a wobble in the starlight from a yellow dwarf in the Pegasus constellation. They had found 51-Pegasi b: the first exoplanet around a sun-like star.\n\nOver the next few decades, astrophysicists honed a whole range of planet-hunting tools. They learned to spot the way planets can change the shape of their stars, how a planet\u2019s gravity can bend light, and the periodic drop in brightness when a planet passes between its star and Earth. Telescopes have become more precise and powerful, and computers have become better at sifting out signal from noise. Today, we\u2019re closing in on 5,000 known exoplanets (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).\n\nFifty years ago, astronomers had no idea what percentage of stars had planets. A common educated guess was 20%, but for all we knew it could have been zero. But based on what we\u2019ve seen since, it seems possible that every star has at least one planetary companion. \n\nNow that we know exoplanets exist, it\u2019s time to learn more about them. What are they made of? How did they form? And, most tantalizing, could they harbor life? We\u2019re like sailors who have spotted a tiny rise of land on the horizon. Now we want to study this new island\u2019s geology and biology and make contact with any inhabitants \u2026 but we have to do it all from aboard our ship, floating trillions of miles out at sea.\n\n~~~\nPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,\na National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249\nhttps://www.rochester.edu/cmap/\n\nAny opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the National Science Foundation.\n~~~\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe discovery of 51 Pegasi b: \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/378355a0\n\nhttps://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/ \n\nThe potential of the James Webb Space Telescope\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22664709/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-december-science-hubble\n\nThe Smallest Lights in the Universe - Sara Seager\u2019s memoir\nhttps://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sara-seager/the-smallest-lights-in-the-universe/\n\nLight of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth\nhttps://www.adamfrankscience.com/light-of-the-stars \n\nThe fraught and fractious history of failed exoplanet discoveries: \nhttps://astronomy.com/bonus/phantoms \n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "Tiny wobbles and faint twinkles that have led astronomers to nearly 5,000 new worlds.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nFor a tour of some of the odd exoplanets scientists have found, watch part one, here: https://youtu.be/lrAFaONyLtU \n\nPluto was discovered in January of 1930, a tiny speck on a photographic plate (https://www.planetary.org/space-images/the-pluto-discovery-plates). It was the most distant world humans had ever seen. Decades later, even the powerful Hubble Space Telescope struggled to get a good look at the dwarf planet \u2013 the Hubble image of Pluto is just a sickly yellow smudge (https://esahubble.org/images/opo1006h/). \n\nSo when astronomers set out to search for planets around other stars (aka \u201cexoplanets), they knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy. Our closest neighbor, a little red dwarf named Proxima Centauri, is 7,000 times further away from us than Pluto. Any planets in orbit around it would likely get lost in the glare of bright starlight.\n\n\u201cTrying to see an earthlike planet across interstellar distances,\u201d writes astrophysicist Adam Frank, \u201cwould be like looking from New York City to AT&T Park in San Francisco, where the Giants play, and making out a firefly next to one of the stadium spotlights.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo detect or study an exoplanet,\u201d says Sara Seager, a planet-hunting astrophysicist at MIT, \u201cwe have to work with the star.\u201d\n\nAstronomers started monitoring stars for tiny changes that could hint at the presence of one or more planets. Early efforts focused on the search for a wobble. The pull of a planet\u2019s gravity causes a star to circle their mutual center of gravity - and from our vantage point the star seems to swing back and forth. In 1995, a Swiss team picked up the signature of just such a wobble in the starlight from a yellow dwarf in the Pegasus constellation. They had found 51-Pegasi b: the first exoplanet around a sun-like star.\n\nOver the next few decades, astrophysicists honed a whole range of planet-hunting tools. They learned to spot the way planets can change the shape of their stars, how a planet\u2019s gravity can bend light, and the periodic drop in brightness when a planet passes between its star and Earth. Telescopes have become more precise and powerful, and computers have become better at sifting out signal from noise. Today, we\u2019re closing in on 5,000 known exoplanets (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).\n\nFifty years ago, astronomers had no idea what percentage of stars had planets. A common educated guess was 20%, but for all we knew it could have been zero. But based on what we\u2019ve seen since, it seems possible that every star has at least one planetary companion. \n\nNow that we know exoplanets exist, it\u2019s time to learn more about them. What are they made of? How did they form? And, most tantalizing, could they harbor life? We\u2019re like sailors who have spotted a tiny rise of land on the horizon. Now we want to study this new island\u2019s geology and biology and make contact with any inhabitants \u2026 but we have to do it all from aboard our ship, floating trillions of miles out at sea.\n\n~~~\nPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,\na National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249\nhttps://www.rochester.edu/cmap/\n\nAny opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the National Science Foundation.\n~~~\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe discovery of 51 Pegasi b: \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/378355a0\n\nhttps://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/ \n\nThe potential of the James Webb Space Telescope\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22664709/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-december-science-hubble\n\nThe Smallest Lights in the Universe - Sara Seager\u2019s memoir\nhttps://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sara-seager/the-smallest-lights-in-the-universe/\n\nLight of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth\nhttps://www.adamfrankscience.com/light-of-the-stars \n\nThe fraught and fractious history of failed exoplanet discoveries: \nhttps://astronomy.com/bonus/phantoms \n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

He had no real proof of his claims \u2014 they just felt true. But they were heretical enough to get the attention of the Roman Catholic Church. The Inquisition arrested Bruno, put his tongue in a vice, and burned him at the stake.\n\nFour hundred years later, the idea of \u201cexoplanets\u201d (the term for planets outside our solar system) had become much more popular. Books, TV, and movies teemed with alien worlds orbiting alien suns. But one thing remained the same. We still had no proof that they existed.\n\nThen, in 1995, astronomers discovered 51 Pegasi b \u2014 a planet orbiting a sun-like star in the Pegasus constellation. Many scientists were skeptical at first; this planet was almost too strange to be believed. Though it was about the size of Jupiter, it was closer to its star than Mercury is to our sun. Most surprisingly, it completed its orbit in just 4 days. \n\nThe years that followed brought a trickle of other discoveries, then a flood. New telescopes were sent to space and new computers crunched the data they collected. Today, we\u2019ve confirmed the existence of nearly 5,000 exoplanets, with many more candidates waiting in the wings. Those planets paint a surprising picture of our galaxy. While astronomers once wondered if any stars have planets - now planetary systems seem the norm. 51 Pegasi b wasn\u2019t a fluke \u2014 gas giants zipping around close to their stars (nicknamed \u201cHot Jupiters\u201d or \u201cRoasters\u201d) are actually very common. We\u2019ve also found lots of \u201csuper earths\u201d \u2014 rocky worlds 2 to ten times bigger than Earth. \n\nOur solar system, on the other hand, seems less common than some had imagined. We haven\u2019t found anything quite like it. But \u2026 it\u2019s still early. And the data we\u2019ve gathered so far has many scientists feeling confident that somewhere out there, just waiting for our telescopes to swing in the right direction, is a planet like Earth.\n\nPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,\na National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249 https://www.rochester.edu/cmap \n\nAny opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the National Science Foundation.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nThe ongoing effort to find even more exoplanets\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/so-many-exoplanets/619717/ \n\nThe discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system\nhttps://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/ \n\nA batch of potentially habitable planets\n\u200b\u200bhttps://www.vox.com/2015/1/6/7503723/kepler-438b-exoplanet \n\nThe Smallest Lights in the Universe - Sara Seager\u2019s memoir\nhttps://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sara-seager/the-smallest-lights-in-the-universe/\n\nGiordano Bruno\u2019s trial and execution: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/was-giordano-bruno-burned-at-the-stake-for-believing-in-exoplanets/\n\nHow we study conditions inside exoplanets here on Earth:\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/massive-machines-are-bringing-giant-exoplanets-down-to-earth/ \n\nPLANETARY SYSTEMS OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE (map): https://bit.ly/3IJs3O7 \n\nBased on a map by Jim Cornmell - https://www.jimscosmos.com/editableallskychart\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "In the last few years, scientists have discovered thousands of exoplanets - and a lot of them are surprisingly weird.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nWatch part 2, How to find a planet you can't see, here: https://youtu.be/STsI6IbPbGQ\n\nIn 1584, Italian friar Giordano Bruno argued that other stars had planets of their own and that those planets had inhabitants. He had no real proof of his claims \u2014 they just felt true. But they were heretical enough to get the attention of the Roman Catholic Church. The Inquisition arrested Bruno, put his tongue in a vice, and burned him at the stake.\n\nFour hundred years later, the idea of \u201cexoplanets\u201d (the term for planets outside our solar system) had become much more popular. Books, TV, and movies teemed with alien worlds orbiting alien suns. But one thing remained the same. We still had no proof that they existed.\n\nThen, in 1995, astronomers discovered 51 Pegasi b \u2014 a planet orbiting a sun-like star in the Pegasus constellation. Many scientists were skeptical at first; this planet was almost too strange to be believed. Though it was about the size of Jupiter, it was closer to its star than Mercury is to our sun. Most surprisingly, it completed its orbit in just 4 days. \n\nThe years that followed brought a trickle of other discoveries, then a flood. New telescopes were sent to space and new computers crunched the data they collected. Today, we\u2019ve confirmed the existence of nearly 5,000 exoplanets, with many more candidates waiting in the wings. Those planets paint a surprising picture of our galaxy. While astronomers once wondered if any stars have planets - now planetary systems seem the norm. 51 Pegasi b wasn\u2019t a fluke \u2014 gas giants zipping around close to their stars (nicknamed \u201cHot Jupiters\u201d or \u201cRoasters\u201d) are actually very common. We\u2019ve also found lots of \u201csuper earths\u201d \u2014 rocky worlds 2 to ten times bigger than Earth. \n\nOur solar system, on the other hand, seems less common than some had imagined. We haven\u2019t found anything quite like it. But \u2026 it\u2019s still early. And the data we\u2019ve gathered so far has many scientists feeling confident that somewhere out there, just waiting for our telescopes to swing in the right direction, is a planet like Earth.\n\nPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,\na National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249 https://www.rochester.edu/cmap \n\nAny opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the National Science Foundation.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nThe ongoing effort to find even more exoplanets\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/so-many-exoplanets/619717/ \n\nThe discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system\nhttps://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/ \n\nA batch of potentially habitable planets\n\u200b\u200bhttps://www.vox.com/2015/1/6/7503723/kepler-438b-exoplanet \n\nThe Smallest Lights in the Universe - Sara Seager\u2019s memoir\nhttps://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sara-seager/the-smallest-lights-in-the-universe/\n\nGiordano Bruno\u2019s trial and execution: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/was-giordano-bruno-burned-at-the-stake-for-believing-in-exoplanets/\n\nHow we study conditions inside exoplanets here on Earth:\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/massive-machines-are-bringing-giant-exoplanets-down-to-earth/ \n\nPLANETARY SYSTEMS OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE (map): https://bit.ly/3IJs3O7 \n\nBased on a map by Jim Cornmell - https://www.jimscosmos.com/editableallskychart\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The Lumbee tribe is primarily located in Robeson County, one of the areas with a high concentration of hog farms that we cover in the video. \n\nhttps://waterkeeper.org/news/who-is-waterkeeper-jefferson-currie-ii-lumber-riverkeeper/\n\nAnother feature of North Carolina that makes it more vulnerable to water contamination is its permeable, sandy soil in areas with a high concentration of hog farms. Experts told me this area used to be swampland, and was drained to make way for agriculture. My colleague Liz Scheltens mentions a similar historical context in a video she made about Lake Erie and cow waste pollution: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwhcrpJTzGQ\n\nThe location of hog farms in North Carolina is related to the history of tobacco farming in the state. When the public health effects of smoking became clear, the government stopped supporting it. Many North Carolina farmers started to diversify their practices, including raising hogs. That\u2019s exactly how Tom Butler got into raising pigs \u2014 he was once a tobacco farmer: \n\nhttp://archive.pov.org/brightleaves/historical-background/\n\nAdvocates and community members are also deeply concerned about the proliferation of large-scale poultry facilities in North Carolina, which accelerated when the moratorium on new or expanded hog farms was enacted in 1997: \n\nhttps://www.wunc.org/environment/2020-07-30/explosive-growth-in-nc-poultry-farms-poses-grave-risks-new-report-says\n\nThe Align RNG map we show in this video, illustrating where a proposed methane pipeline might go, has been a source of heated debate in North Carolina. The Southern Environmental Law Center and other organizations have asked the state for more transparency about where the farms and the pipeline are located in order to get informed public input on the project. More details on this are in this story: \n\nhttps://ncpolicywatch.com/2020/11/16/smithfield-dominion-propose-major-swine-gas-project-but-details-are-secret-troubling-residents/\n\nWe contacted Align RNG and Smithfield for this story, and they both said they sought public input for the biogas project and touted the project\u2019s potential for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. They also said that the state of North Carolina has \u201cstringent\u201d permit regulations that they adhere to. \n\nVox\u2019s Future Perfect team covered this issue here: \nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/9/16/21430837/future-perfect-podcast-season-3-north-carolina-cafo-pig-farm\n\nAnd in a podcast episode, as part of their series on meat: \nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/6N7jb4NsgUTzRhYOtuYQH0?si=f1ceb3d817854013\n\nA similar debate about the promises of biogas is happening in the dairy industry as well: \nhttps://civileats.com/2020/04/24/are-dairy-digesters-the-renewable-energy-answer-or-a-false-solution-to-climate-change/\n\nProPublica has a more in-depth investigation into the Smithfield agreement:\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/a-hog-waste-agreement-lacked-teeth-and-some-north-carolinians-say-left-to-suffer\n\nI learned a lot from Melba Newsome\u2019s writing and reporting on this issue for North Carolina Health News: \nhttps://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2021/10/29/legal-battles-over-pollution-from-hog-waste-environmental-racism-havent-changed-much/\n\nRick Dove of the Waterkeeper Alliance manages a website that tracks this issue: \nhttp://www.riverlaw.us/\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter.

Experts told me this area used to be swampland, and was drained to make way for agriculture. My colleague Liz Scheltens mentions a similar historical context in a video she made about Lake Erie and cow waste pollution: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwhcrpJTzGQ\n\nThe location of hog farms in North Carolina is related to the history of tobacco farming in the state. When the public health effects of smoking became clear, the government stopped supporting it. Many North Carolina farmers started to diversify their practices, including raising hogs. That\u2019s exactly how Tom Butler got into raising pigs \u2014 he was once a tobacco farmer: \n\nhttp://archive.pov.org/brightleaves/historical-background/\n\nAdvocates and community members are also deeply concerned about the proliferation of large-scale poultry facilities in North Carolina, which accelerated when the moratorium on new or expanded hog farms was enacted in 1997: \n\nhttps://www.wunc.org/environment/2020-07-30/explosive-growth-in-nc-poultry-farms-poses-grave-risks-new-report-says\n\nThe Align RNG map we show in this video, illustrating where a proposed methane pipeline might go, has been a source of heated debate in North Carolina. The Southern Environmental Law Center and other organizations have asked the state for more transparency about where the farms and the pipeline are located in order to get informed public input on the project. More details on this are in this story: \n\nhttps://ncpolicywatch.com/2020/11/16/smithfield-dominion-propose-major-swine-gas-project-but-details-are-secret-troubling-residents/\n\nWe contacted Align RNG and Smithfield for this story, and they both said they sought public input for the biogas project and touted the project\u2019s potential for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. They also said that the state of North Carolina has \u201cstringent\u201d permit regulations that they adhere to. \n\nVox\u2019s Future Perfect team covered this issue here: \nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/9/16/21430837/future-perfect-podcast-season-3-north-carolina-cafo-pig-farm\n\nAnd in a podcast episode, as part of their series on meat: \nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/6N7jb4NsgUTzRhYOtuYQH0?si=f1ceb3d817854013\n\nA similar debate about the promises of biogas is happening in the dairy industry as well: \nhttps://civileats.com/2020/04/24/are-dairy-digesters-the-renewable-energy-answer-or-a-false-solution-to-climate-change/\n\nProPublica has a more in-depth investigation into the Smithfield agreement:\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/a-hog-waste-agreement-lacked-teeth-and-some-north-carolinians-say-left-to-suffer\n\nI learned a lot from Melba Newsome\u2019s writing and reporting on this issue for North Carolina Health News: \nhttps://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2021/10/29/legal-battles-over-pollution-from-hog-waste-environmental-racism-havent-changed-much/\n\nRick Dove of the Waterkeeper Alliance manages a website that tracks this issue: \nhttp://www.riverlaw.us/\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter.

Billed as a successor to the beloved Hubble Space Telescope, the Webb\u2019s mirror is six times larger and its instruments are tuned to observe longer wavelengths, in order to detect the stretched-out light from primitive galaxies 13.5 billion light years away.\n\nThat primary mission \u2014 to see the first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang \u2014 determined the unusual and challenging design of the telescope. Instead of a shiny tube, the Webb Telescope looks like a giant honeycomb riding on a silver surfboard. The short answer to why it looks like that is: It needs to be very big and very cold.\n\nIn the video above, NASA astrophysicist Amber Straughn and Vox's Joss Fong build a small model of the telescope to explore its extraordinary design.\n\nPaper model: https://webb.nasa.gov/content/features/educational/paperModel/paperModel.html\nUnexplainable podcast episodes: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6DDrK4JWAS4BxTFLpvFBE8 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hotsWN0t3A5XMOotXlSY0\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter.

Billed as a successor to the beloved Hubble Space Telescope, the Webb\u2019s mirror is six times larger and its instruments are tuned to observe longer wavelengths, in order to detect the stretched-out light from primitive galaxies 13.5 billion light years away.\n\nThat primary mission \u2014 to see the first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang \u2014 determined the unusual and challenging design of the telescope. Instead of a shiny tube, the Webb Telescope looks like a giant honeycomb riding on a silver surfboard. The short answer to why it looks like that is: It needs to be very big and very cold.\n\nIn the video above, NASA astrophysicist Amber Straughn and Vox's Joss Fong build a small model of the telescope to explore its extraordinary design.\n\nPaper model: https://webb.nasa.gov/content/features/educational/paperModel/paperModel.html\nUnexplainable podcast episodes: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6DDrK4JWAS4BxTFLpvFBE8 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hotsWN0t3A5XMOotXlSY0\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter.

But those farmers are taking on modern problems. Facing issues like land loss, extreme weather, and economic disruption, individual farms are feeling the heat. \u201cI worry that we\u2019re at a tipping point with agriculture,\u201d says Dayna Burtness of Nettle Valley Farm, an independent farmer who raises her pigs on pasture.\n\nTo read more about the challenges that farmers face, and how you can get involved and support farmers, visit www.eater.com/ad/22686199/farmers-adapting-climate-change-tillamook",

                    "description": "\u201cWhen the average person thinks about a farm, they most likely think of something from yesteryear. They don\u2019t necessarily think about a part of our society that is vital to our food, our water, our climate and our future,\u201d says David Haight, the VP of Programs at American Farmland Trust (AFT). But those farmers are taking on modern problems. Facing issues like land loss, extreme weather, and economic disruption, individual farms are feeling the heat. \u201cI worry that we\u2019re at a tipping point with agriculture,\u201d says Dayna Burtness of Nettle Valley Farm, an independent farmer who raises her pigs on pasture.\n\nTo read more about the challenges that farmers face, and how you can get involved and support farmers, visit www.eater.com/ad/22686199/farmers-adapting-climate-change-tillamook"

Over the past few decades, poultry processing line speeds have increased to meet demand. But that\u2019s happened in tandem with the decline of unions and deregulation of the industry. The result is a high rate of workplace injuries and repetitive motion disorders, with gaps in workplace safety oversight. \n\nFor this video, we contacted Tyson Foods Inc. and the National Chicken Council for comment. The NCC, the poultry industry lobby that has repeatedly requested increases in line speeds, wrote that faster line speeds do not affect the pace of work because plants will add additional staff and lines to accommodate speed increases. Through our reporting, we weren\u2019t able to substantiate this claim, and the NCC did not respond when we asked for an example or for any evidence that this is the industry standard. \n\nThe NCC also mentioned that other countries run poultry line speeds as fast as, if not faster than, the US. It\u2019s difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison with other countries. Claire Kelloway, reporter and researcher for OpenMarkets, noted that in Europe, for example, factories are typically smaller than US plants, and have higher rates of unionization and more industry safety regulation. The regulating agencies enforce longer breaks and switching up job roles to avoid repetition. Even so, working conditions in poultry plants are still criticized there. \n\nWhile the NCC cited a decline in workplace injuries, advocates and experts say that this data is unreliable. It relies on workers reporting injuries to the government agency that regulates workplace safety, OSHA. There are a number of reasons a poultry worker might not report an injury or illness, including language barriers or fears over their citizenship status. Worker and advocate-led surveys show high levels of injury, here are examples: \n\nhttps://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Unsafe_at_These_Speeds_web.pdf\n\nhttps://foodchainworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Hands-That-Feed-Us-Report.pdf\n\nhttps://www.uusc.org/sites/default/files/wages_and_working_conditions_in_arkansas_poultry_plants.pdf\n\nTyson disputes, without evidence, the petition that Magaly Licolli presented on behalf of the workers at the Berry Street poultry plant in Springdale, Arkansas. The company said it was misrepresented to those who signed it and that there were duplicate signatures. Tyson also noted that it offered raises to poultry workers in 2021 amid a labor shortage. \n\nWe also contacted OSHA for comment. They noted that they issue citations or fines to any workplace found by federal inspectors to have violated their safety standards, but confirmed that it is under the jurisdiction of the USDA to determine line speeds. They also said that they do not track data on the use of the chemicals we mention in the video: chlorine, ammonia, and peracetic acid. \n\nWhile reporting this episode I read Christopher Leonard\u2019s The Meat Racket, a deep-dive report into the history of Tyson and the poultry industry: \nhttps://bookshop.org/books/the-meat-racket-the-secret-takeover-of-america-s-food-business/9781451645835\n\nMore reading on poultry plants in Europe: \nhttps://thefern.org/2020/06/how-did-europe-manage-to-avoid-the-covid-19-catastrophe-ravaging-u-s-meatpacking-plants/\n\nHow meat consumption has changed in the past 50 years: \nhttps://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-consumption-by-type-kilograms-per-year?country=~OWID_WRL\n\nMore coverage of the failed OSHA ergonomics rule: \nhttps://www.motherjones.com/food/2020/07/labor-eugene-scalia-meatpacking-osha-stress-carpal-tunnel-coronavirus-covid/\n\nDeborah Berkowitz, former OSHA chief of staff and director of the Worker Health & Safety Program of the National Employment Law Project, was a crucial source for this story.

They noted that they issue citations or fines to any workplace found by federal inspectors to have violated their safety standards, but confirmed that it is under the jurisdiction of the USDA to determine line speeds. They also said that they do not track data on the use of the chemicals we mention in the video: chlorine, ammonia, and peracetic acid. \n\nWhile reporting this episode I read Christopher Leonard\u2019s The Meat Racket, a deep-dive report into the history of Tyson and the poultry industry: \nhttps://bookshop.org/books/the-meat-racket-the-secret-takeover-of-america-s-food-business/9781451645835\n\nMore reading on poultry plants in Europe: \nhttps://thefern.org/2020/06/how-did-europe-manage-to-avoid-the-covid-19-catastrophe-ravaging-u-s-meatpacking-plants/\n\nHow meat consumption has changed in the past 50 years: \nhttps://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-consumption-by-type-kilograms-per-year?country=~OWID_WRL\n\nMore coverage of the failed OSHA ergonomics rule: \nhttps://www.motherjones.com/food/2020/07/labor-eugene-scalia-meatpacking-osha-stress-carpal-tunnel-coronavirus-covid/\n\nDeborah Berkowitz, former OSHA chief of staff and director of the Worker Health & Safety Program of the National Employment Law Project, was a crucial source for this story.

Sorry!\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications (\ud83d\udd14) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen any remotely creepy movie, you\u2019ve heard a loon wail: that mournful, nearly human ooo-ooo-oooo. It pops up whenever a movie needs to convey melancholy or trepidation, often accompanied by a full moon or some fog. But for the most part, loons have no business being in the background of those scenes. \n\nWith the help of some internet birders, we took a deep dive (pun intended) into the world of loons to explain how Hollywood misuses this bird call \u2014 and why the wail is so haunting in the first place. \n\nTo learn more about loons and what you can do to help protect them check out the Loon Preservation Committee (https://loon.org/) and the  Adirondack Center for Loon Conservation (https://www.adkloon.org/). \n\nCheck out the Switched on Pop podcast from Charlie Harding here: https://open.spotify.com/show/1sgWaKtQxwfjUpZnnK8r7J \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It pops up whenever a movie needs to convey melancholy or trepidation, often accompanied by a full moon or some fog. But for the most part, loons have no business being in the background of those scenes. \n\nWith the help of some internet birders, we took a deep dive (pun intended) into the world of loons to explain how Hollywood misuses this bird call \u2014 and why the wail is so haunting in the first place. \n\nTo learn more about loons and what you can do to help protect them check out the Loon Preservation Committee (https://loon.org/) and the  Adirondack Center for Loon Conservation (https://www.adkloon.org/). \n\nCheck out the Switched on Pop podcast from Charlie Harding here: https://open.spotify.com/show/1sgWaKtQxwfjUpZnnK8r7J \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

His collection numbers over 11,000; images of old age homes, ugly restaurants, and 1960s advertising are neatly organized in boxes in his Canadian home. But James started to notice that some of his postcards \u2014 dozens, in fact \u2014 appeared to have the exact same sky. Looking even closer, he noticed that the same-sky postcards were all made by one publisher: Dexter Press out of West Nyack, New York. \n\nDexter Press was once one of the largest publishers of \"chrome-era postcards,\" \u2014 postcards made from color photographs that became popular in the 1940s. By the time James started collecting in the 1980s, \"chrome cards\" were mostly overlooked by collectors, and could be bought for cheap in flea markets. It wasn't until he looked through a lot of these cards that he noticed the same sky repeating itself. \n\nDarkroom producer Coleman Lowndes took a trip to British Columbia, Canada, to see James's collection for himself \u2014 and to help solve the mystery of these identical skies. To James though, the mystery doesn't really matter. The reason the skies look the same is less important to him than the unusual visual effect it produces when all these skies come together.\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story.

But James started to notice that some of his postcards \u2014 dozens, in fact \u2014 appeared to have the exact same sky. Looking even closer, he noticed that the same-sky postcards were all made by one publisher: Dexter Press out of West Nyack, New York. \n\nDexter Press was once one of the largest publishers of \"chrome-era postcards,\" \u2014 postcards made from color photographs that became popular in the 1940s. By the time James started collecting in the 1980s, \"chrome cards\" were mostly overlooked by collectors, and could be bought for cheap in flea markets. It wasn't until he looked through a lot of these cards that he noticed the same sky repeating itself. \n\nDarkroom producer Coleman Lowndes took a trip to British Columbia, Canada, to see James's collection for himself \u2014 and to help solve the mystery of these identical skies. To James though, the mystery doesn't really matter. The reason the skies look the same is less important to him than the unusual visual effect it produces when all these skies come together.\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story.

For as long as they can remember, their lives have been intertwined with that of the moose. It\u2019s more than a source of food \u2014 it\u2019s also a way of staying in touch with their ancestors, who carved game pieces from the antlers, fashioned elaborate clothing from the hides, and used the hair to embroider intricate designs on everything from stockings to cradleboards. \n\nBut this relationship between the Anishinaabe and the moose is in danger. The population has been in freefall for the past two decades. We joined a group of scientists as they set out to unravel the mystery, in the hopes that this generation of Anishinaabe won\u2019t be the last to thrive alongside the moose.\n\nNote: A previous version of this video was mistakenly published with a graphical error.

For as long as they can remember, their lives have been intertwined with that of the moose. It\u2019s more than a source of food \u2014 it\u2019s also a way of staying in touch with their ancestors, who carved game pieces from the antlers, fashioned elaborate clothing from the hides, and used the hair to embroider intricate designs on everything from stockings to cradleboards. \n\nBut this relationship between the Anishinaabe and the moose is in danger. The population has been in freefall for the past two decades. We joined a group of scientists as they set out to unravel the mystery, in the hopes that this generation of Anishinaabe won\u2019t be the last to thrive alongside the moose.\n\nNote: A previous version of this video was mistakenly published with a graphical error.

Kennedy. But before Oswald died, he claimed that a damning piece of evidence against him \u2014 a photo showing Oswald holding the rifle that killed the president \u2014 was fake. In fact, he said his face was superimposed onto another person\u2019s body to set him up. \n\nThe photo\u2019s authenticity has been in question ever since, and it plays a key role in the conspiracy theory surrounding JFK\u2019s death. The shadows in the photo seem inconsistent, and Oswald\u2019s crooked stance under the weight of the rifle looks like he is about to tip over. Plus, his face doesn\u2019t look the same as it does in his mug shot. \n\nFor decades, conspiracy theorists have used this image as key evidence to suggest that Oswald was framed. But decades of analysis \u2014 including recent 3D forensic analysis \u2014 has proved over and over that the photo is likely authentic. \n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story.

Kennedy. But before Oswald died, he claimed that a damning piece of evidence against him \u2014 a photo showing Oswald holding the rifle that killed the president \u2014 was fake. In fact, he said his face was superimposed onto another person\u2019s body to set him up. \n\nThe photo\u2019s authenticity has been in question ever since, and it plays a key role in the conspiracy theory surrounding JFK\u2019s death. The shadows in the photo seem inconsistent, and Oswald\u2019s crooked stance under the weight of the rifle looks like he is about to tip over. Plus, his face doesn\u2019t look the same as it does in his mug shot. \n\nFor decades, conspiracy theorists have used this image as key evidence to suggest that Oswald was framed. But decades of analysis \u2014 including recent 3D forensic analysis \u2014 has proved over and over that the photo is likely authentic. \n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story.

Why?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAnimals all across the world are undergoing a strange transformation. In Appalachia, salamander body sizes have decreased by 8 percent since 1960; menhaden fish caught in the Atlantic are 15 percent lighter than they were in 1987; and bird specimens at Chicago\u2019s Field Museum have lost up to 4 percent of their body mass since collection began in the late 1970s. \n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that these changes are the product of global warming:\u00a0as average temperatures rise, smaller bodies make it easier for warm-blooded animals to stay cool. For cold-blooded animals, warming temperatures speed up metabolism and stunt their full growth. These changes might appear relatively small, but they can have a huge impact on animal\u2019s lives, making them more susceptible to predation, reduced offspring count, and drying out in droughts. \n\nWild animals already face a wide range of threats; shrinking could push them even closer to extinction \u2014\u00a0with dire consequences for the ecosystems that humans rely on.\n\nRead more about this from Vox.com reporter Benji Jones: https://www.vox.com/22558979/animals-birds-shrinking-size-heat-climate-change \n\nAnd check out Vox's project Down to Earth, featuring stories about the global biodiversity crisis. https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth \n\nRead Jennifer Sheridan's 2011 perspective here: https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1259\n\nAnd Brian Weeks' 2019 analysis: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.13434\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Why?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAnimals all across the world are undergoing a strange transformation. In Appalachia, salamander body sizes have decreased by 8 percent since 1960; menhaden fish caught in the Atlantic are 15 percent lighter than they were in 1987; and bird specimens at Chicago\u2019s Field Museum have lost up to 4 percent of their body mass since collection began in the late 1970s. \n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that these changes are the product of global warming:\u00a0as average temperatures rise, smaller bodies make it easier for warm-blooded animals to stay cool. For cold-blooded animals, warming temperatures speed up metabolism and stunt their full growth. These changes might appear relatively small, but they can have a huge impact on animal\u2019s lives, making them more susceptible to predation, reduced offspring count, and drying out in droughts. \n\nWild animals already face a wide range of threats; shrinking could push them even closer to extinction \u2014\u00a0with dire consequences for the ecosystems that humans rely on.\n\nRead more about this from Vox.com reporter Benji Jones: https://www.vox.com/22558979/animals-birds-shrinking-size-heat-climate-change \n\nAnd check out Vox's project Down to Earth, featuring stories about the global biodiversity crisis. https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth \n\nRead Jennifer Sheridan's 2011 perspective here: https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1259\n\nAnd Brian Weeks' 2019 analysis: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.13434\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Divers spend years training to perform with minimal splash, in the same way that gymnasts train to stick their landings.\n\nIn this video, Team USA\u2019s head diving coach Drew Johansen explains the three major components he uses to guide his athletes towards smaller splashes: the above water position, the underwater swim, and the underwater pike. \n\nAnd while the sport of diving isn\u2019t all about getting splashes, a small splash is the perfect punctuation to a job well done.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The splash.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched any Olympics diving coverage, you may have noticed that the splashes athletes make are tiny. Divers spend years training to perform with minimal splash, in the same way that gymnasts train to stick their landings.\n\nIn this video, Team USA\u2019s head diving coach Drew Johansen explains the three major components he uses to guide his athletes towards smaller splashes: the above water position, the underwater swim, and the underwater pike. \n\nAnd while the sport of diving isn\u2019t all about getting splashes, a small splash is the perfect punctuation to a job well done.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

As these routines get more and more complicated, they become harder to top -- and the latest way to add value and distinguish a routine is the wolf turn.\n\nThe wolf turn has actually been around for decades. But recently it\u2019s become a favorite in balance beam and floor routines. A gymnast will get into a squat position with one leg stretched out. She\u2019ll then stretch out her arms and wind them up. Once she finds her balance, she\u2019ll start spinning. Finally, she\u2019ll stop and return to her original stance. \n\nSeems pretty simple, but the movement relies on a delicate balance of mass and inertia. One wobble and things fall apart. Of course, there\u2019s a reason gymnasts perform this delicate balance: points. The turn is used strategically because its relatively high difficulty level means judges value it more than a regular turn.\n\nTo read more about how judges score gymnasts, check out this article from USA gymnastics: https://usagym.org/pages/events/pages/fig_scoring.html and this one from The Balance Beam Situation: https://balancebeamsituation.com/elite-skill-database/wolf-turn-double-balance-beam/\n\nAnd make sure to check out Nicole Langevin\u2019s podcast, What Makes You Think: https://www.audible.com/pd/Podcast/B08K56FCJV\n\nTo read more Simone Biles\u2019s role in the 2020 Olympic Games, check out this explainer from Vox: https://www.vox.com/22596910/simone-biles-withdrawal-olympic-gymnastics-team-finals-results \n\nAnd read all of Vox\u2019s Tokyo Olympics coverage here: https://www.vox.com/22580164/tokyo-japan-olympics-2021-summer-covid\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

US Army soldiers patrolling the park brought him into custody, and the story led to the first US federal law protecting wildlife. The soldiers were thought of as heroes for stopping the killer. But it was the US Army who had been responsible for driving bison to near-extinction in the first place. \n\nIn the mid-1800s, a cultural belief known as \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d dictated that white settlers were the rightful owners of the entire North American continent \u2013 even though Native Americans had inhabited the land for centuries. In order to clear that land for white settlers, the US Army engaged in violent scorched-earth tactics against the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains. One big part of that campaign was to eliminate their crucial food source: the bison. \n\nBy the end of the 1800s, a combination of commercial and recreational hunting, plus the actions of the US Army, had depleted the bison population to under a thousand, down from tens of millions at the beginning of the century. Around the same time, the US government set aside some of the land once inhabited by the Plains Indians as a national park, and in 1872 Yellowstone was established. \n\nA key mission of Yellowstone was to conserve the land and the animals that roamed there, including the bison.

US Army soldiers patrolling the park brought him into custody, and the story led to the first US federal law protecting wildlife. The soldiers were thought of as heroes for stopping the killer. But it was the US Army who had been responsible for driving bison to near-extinction in the first place. \n\nIn the mid-1800s, a cultural belief known as \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d dictated that white settlers were the rightful owners of the entire North American continent \u2013 even though Native Americans had inhabited the land for centuries. In order to clear that land for white settlers, the US Army engaged in violent scorched-earth tactics against the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains. One big part of that campaign was to eliminate their crucial food source: the bison. \n\nBy the end of the 1800s, a combination of commercial and recreational hunting, plus the actions of the US Army, had depleted the bison population to under a thousand, down from tens of millions at the beginning of the century. Around the same time, the US government set aside some of the land once inhabited by the Plains Indians as a national park, and in 1872 Yellowstone was established. \n\nA key mission of Yellowstone was to conserve the land and the animals that roamed there, including the bison. Today, the soldiers that once patrolled the park are celebrated for having \u201csaved\u201d the bison in Yellowstone, obscuring their own violent contribution to the animal\u2019s near-extinction.\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

Olympians need to have the speed of a 200-meter dash runner, the endurance of an 800-meter runner, an understanding of rhythm, and, of course, the ability to efficiently clear a hurdle. \n\nVarious techniques can make or break a race. If you jump too high, you\u2019re wasting time and energy; too low and you collide with a hurdle. Even if your technique over the hurdles is perfect, you can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t have the speed. Former Olympic hurdler and (until very recently) world record-holder Kevin Young helps us break down the rhythm of the 400-meter hurdles.\n\nCorrection: Karsten Warholm broke Kevin Young's record at a Diamond League meet in Oslo, Norway on July 1 \u2014 not at the Olympic Trials. \n\nFor more:\nhttps://hurdlesfirstbeta.com/\nhttps://trackstarusa.com/\nhttps://www.runnersworld.com/\nhttps://www.britannica.com/sports/hurdling\nhttps://www.nbcolympics.com/news/track-field-101-rules\n\n\nMcLaughlin + Warholm\u2019s record-breaking races:\nhttps://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/07/01/karsten-warholm-world-record-400-hurdles/\nhttps://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/06/28/sydney-mclaughlin-world-record-400-hurdles-olympic-trials/\n\nStudies:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005844/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20703164/\n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Former Olympic hurdler and (until very recently) world record-holder Kevin Young helps us break down the rhythm of the 400-meter hurdles.\n\nCorrection: Karsten Warholm broke Kevin Young's record at a Diamond League meet in Oslo, Norway on July 1 \u2014 not at the Olympic Trials. \n\nFor more:\nhttps://hurdlesfirstbeta.com/\nhttps://trackstarusa.com/\nhttps://www.runnersworld.com/\nhttps://www.britannica.com/sports/hurdling\nhttps://www.nbcolympics.com/news/track-field-101-rules\n\n\nMcLaughlin + Warholm\u2019s record-breaking races:\nhttps://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/07/01/karsten-warholm-world-record-400-hurdles/\nhttps://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/06/28/sydney-mclaughlin-world-record-400-hurdles-olympic-trials/\n\nStudies:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005844/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20703164/\n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                "description": "In 1961, Life magazine photographed systemic poverty in Brazil. One Brazilian magazine responded with a similar report \u2014 featuring photos of New York City. \n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications (\ud83d\udd14) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nLife magazine, then the most popular general interest weekly in the United States, announced in 1961 that it wanted to help win the Cold War. Communist revolutionary Fidel Castro had taken control of Cuba two years earlier, making nearby Latin American countries the newest battleground over economic influence between the capitalist US and communist Soviet Union. The magazine wanted to promote President John F. Kennedy\u2019s new \u201cAlliance for Progress\u201d financial aid program, which planned to use financial incentives to encourage Latin American countries to resist communism and fall under US influence. \n\nAs part of its new mission, Life sent photographer Gordon Parks to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to report on systemic poverty there. His resulting photo essay, and in particular his main subject, 12-year-old Flavio da Silva, was hugely popular in the US. Life\u2019s readers, moved by the photos of Flavio and his story of struggling with severe asthma, mailed in thousands in donations to \u201csave him.\u201d The leading pediatric asthma hospital in the US, in Denver, Colorado, offered to treat him for free. A follow-up cover story by Life, titled \u201cFlavio\u2019s Rescue,\u201d celebrated American generosity. \n\nBut Brazilian media saw the photo essay as a negative, stereotypical view of Brazil. Brazilian magazine O Cruzeiro \u2014 a weekly publication that, like Life, featured photographic essays \u2014 decided to respond to Life\u2019s report. O Cruzeiro sent one of its photographers, Henri Ballot, to New York. There, he photographed a family of Puerto Rican immigrants living in a poor area of Manhattan, and O Cruzeiro printed the photos in a layout that directly copied Life\u2019s. When examined side by side, the two photo essays \u2014 and the international feud they kicked off \u2014 tell a story of sensationalism, and propaganda. \n\nUltimately, US intervention in Latin American in the 1960s didn\u2019t work out as Kennedy hoped. The Alliance for Progress sent Latin American countries billions of dollars in financial aid, but it didn\u2019t end up benefiting the people living in the region, and by the 1970s was considered a failure. Like the two photo essays, the initiative was more about propaganda than it was about addressing the root causes of poverty. \n\nThe Fl\u00e1vio Story, co-published by Steidl Books and The Gordon Parks Foundation:\nhttps://steidl.de/Books/The-Flavio-Story-0306263147.html\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

                    "description": "In 1961, Life magazine photographed systemic poverty in Brazil. One Brazilian magazine responded with a similar report \u2014 featuring photos of New York City. \n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications (\ud83d\udd14) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nLife magazine, then the most popular general interest weekly in the United States, announced in 1961 that it wanted to help win the Cold War. Communist revolutionary Fidel Castro had taken control of Cuba two years earlier, making nearby Latin American countries the newest battleground over economic influence between the capitalist US and communist Soviet Union. The magazine wanted to promote President John F. Kennedy\u2019s new \u201cAlliance for Progress\u201d financial aid program, which planned to use financial incentives to encourage Latin American countries to resist communism and fall under US influence. \n\nAs part of its new mission, Life sent photographer Gordon Parks to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to report on systemic poverty there. His resulting photo essay, and in particular his main subject, 12-year-old Flavio da Silva, was hugely popular in the US. Life\u2019s readers, moved by the photos of Flavio and his story of struggling with severe asthma, mailed in thousands in donations to \u201csave him.\u201d The leading pediatric asthma hospital in the US, in Denver, Colorado, offered to treat him for free. A follow-up cover story by Life, titled \u201cFlavio\u2019s Rescue,\u201d celebrated American generosity. \n\nBut Brazilian media saw the photo essay as a negative, stereotypical view of Brazil. Brazilian magazine O Cruzeiro \u2014 a weekly publication that, like Life, featured photographic essays \u2014 decided to respond to Life\u2019s report. O Cruzeiro sent one of its photographers, Henri Ballot, to New York. There, he photographed a family of Puerto Rican immigrants living in a poor area of Manhattan, and O Cruzeiro printed the photos in a layout that directly copied Life\u2019s. When examined side by side, the two photo essays \u2014 and the international feud they kicked off \u2014 tell a story of sensationalism, and propaganda. \n\nUltimately, US intervention in Latin American in the 1960s didn\u2019t work out as Kennedy hoped. The Alliance for Progress sent Latin American countries billions of dollars in financial aid, but it didn\u2019t end up benefiting the people living in the region, and by the 1970s was considered a failure. Like the two photo essays, the initiative was more about propaganda than it was about addressing the root causes of poverty. \n\nThe Fl\u00e1vio Story, co-published by Steidl Books and The Gordon Parks Foundation:\nhttps://steidl.de/Books/The-Flavio-Story-0306263147.html\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

Until November of 2020, though, that didn\u2019t seem to matter. That\u2019s when scientists in the United Kingdom noticed an alarming change: The virus had mutated in a way that made it more transmissible. Within a month, similar reports were emerging from places around the world. Suddenly, it seemed the virus was changing at an alarming rate.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 hasn\u2019t actually been mutating faster, though. Instead, by letting it spread around the world, we\u2019ve just given it more and more opportunities to mutate as it replicates. The result is that, after countless random mutations, there are signs that the virus is beginning to adapt to our natural defenses. And because it\u2019s completely normal for a virus to change over time, we shouldn\u2019t expect it to stop. The only real way to stop those changes is to stop giving the virus so many opportunities. \n\nRead more coverage from Vox on Covid-19 variants:\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22247525/covid-19-variants-uk-south-africa-brazil-b117-why-now\nhttps://www.vox.com/22385588/covid-19-vaccine-variant-mutation-n440k-india-moderna-pfizer-b1617\nhttps://www.vox.com/22298973/covid-19-vaccine-mutation-coronavirus-variant-moderna-pfizer-johnson\n\nData on Covid-19 cases and vaccination rates:\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations\n\nInteractive data on the SARS-CoV-2 genome:\nhttps://nextstrain.org/ncov/global\n\nMore on the variants: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/health/coronavirus-variant-tracker.html\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Until November of 2020, though, that didn\u2019t seem to matter. That\u2019s when scientists in the United Kingdom noticed an alarming change: The virus had mutated in a way that made it more transmissible. Within a month, similar reports were emerging from places around the world. Suddenly, it seemed the virus was changing at an alarming rate.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 hasn\u2019t actually been mutating faster, though. Instead, by letting it spread around the world, we\u2019ve just given it more and more opportunities to mutate as it replicates. The result is that, after countless random mutations, there are signs that the virus is beginning to adapt to our natural defenses. And because it\u2019s completely normal for a virus to change over time, we shouldn\u2019t expect it to stop. The only real way to stop those changes is to stop giving the virus so many opportunities. \n\nRead more coverage from Vox on Covid-19 variants:\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22247525/covid-19-variants-uk-south-africa-brazil-b117-why-now\nhttps://www.vox.com/22385588/covid-19-vaccine-variant-mutation-n440k-india-moderna-pfizer-b1617\nhttps://www.vox.com/22298973/covid-19-vaccine-mutation-coronavirus-variant-moderna-pfizer-johnson\n\nData on Covid-19 cases and vaccination rates:\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations\n\nInteractive data on the SARS-CoV-2 genome:\nhttps://nextstrain.org/ncov/global\n\nMore on the variants: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/health/coronavirus-variant-tracker.html\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Then he went to war.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn 2019, after ending Ethiopia\u2019s decades-long war with its neighbor, Eritrea, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. It seemed like a new beginning for Ethiopia. After decades of dictatorships and oppressive regimes, he appeared to finally be putting the country on a new path.\n\nBut less than a year later, Abiy had already launched a military attack \u2014 on Tigray, a regional state in his own country. When Abiy became prime minister in 2018, he had largely supplanted Tigray\u2019s main political party, the TPLF, as the country\u2019s center of power. Since then, tensions between Abiy and the TPLF had escalated quickly. The political rivalry led to a dispute over an election, which led to an alleged attack on a military base \u2014 and finally to Abiy\u2019s deployment of the military.\n\nAbiy promised to bring peace to Ethiopia; now he\u2019s presiding over a war that exploded from dispute to devastation in a matter of weeks, and has no obvious end in sight. Much of Tigray\u2019s territory has been captured by local armies and militias. Thousands have died or fled their homes.

                "description": "What killed 9 hikers in 1959?\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nIn February 1959 a group of hikers disappeared in the remote Ural Mountains of Western Siberia. A search party found their tent weeks later, abandoned along with all of their equipment. Frozen bodies were found 1,500 meters away, mysteriously underdressed for the weather conditions: most weren\u2019t wearing shoes or gloves, and some were just in their sleeping clothes. Even stranger, three of the hikers had suffered major internal trauma \u2014 broken ribs and a fractured skull \u2014 and two were wearing clothes contaminated with radioactive substances. \n\nNonetheless, the lead Soviet investigator closed the criminal case into the hikers\u2019 deaths, concluding that an \u201coverwhelming force\u201d is what drove them from the tent. Theories ranging from rare weather events to conspiracy to UFOs have developed ever since, to explain what is now called the Dyatlov Pass incident. But two plausible theories, each involving an \u201coverwhelming force\u201d may finally explain what happened that night. \n\nIt could have been a delayed slab avalanche. The hikers dug a platform into the slope of Kholat Syakhl to pitch the tent, and a scientific model published in January 2021 demonstrates that this, combined with strong downslope winds that accumulated snow above the tent, triggered a deadly slab avalanche. This type of avalanche can occur even in places not known for avalanches and can cause injuries consistent with the ones some of the hikers sustained. \n\nIt also could have been a strong \u201ckatabatic wind,\u201d a powerful wind that travels down a mountain slope, picking up speed under the force of gravity. In this scenario, a strong wind can become near-hurricane level very suddenly. If this happened the night of the incident, it could explain why the hikers would have abandoned their tent so quickly, as the powerful wind would potentially tear the tent apart.

                    "description": "What killed 9 hikers in 1959?\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nIn February 1959 a group of hikers disappeared in the remote Ural Mountains of Western Siberia. A search party found their tent weeks later, abandoned along with all of their equipment. Frozen bodies were found 1,500 meters away, mysteriously underdressed for the weather conditions: most weren\u2019t wearing shoes or gloves, and some were just in their sleeping clothes. Even stranger, three of the hikers had suffered major internal trauma \u2014 broken ribs and a fractured skull \u2014 and two were wearing clothes contaminated with radioactive substances. \n\nNonetheless, the lead Soviet investigator closed the criminal case into the hikers\u2019 deaths, concluding that an \u201coverwhelming force\u201d is what drove them from the tent. Theories ranging from rare weather events to conspiracy to UFOs have developed ever since, to explain what is now called the Dyatlov Pass incident. But two plausible theories, each involving an \u201coverwhelming force\u201d may finally explain what happened that night. \n\nIt could have been a delayed slab avalanche. The hikers dug a platform into the slope of Kholat Syakhl to pitch the tent, and a scientific model published in January 2021 demonstrates that this, combined with strong downslope winds that accumulated snow above the tent, triggered a deadly slab avalanche. This type of avalanche can occur even in places not known for avalanches and can cause injuries consistent with the ones some of the hikers sustained. \n\nIt also could have been a strong \u201ckatabatic wind,\u201d a powerful wind that travels down a mountain slope, picking up speed under the force of gravity. In this scenario, a strong wind can become near-hurricane level very suddenly. If this happened the night of the incident, it could explain why the hikers would have abandoned their tent so quickly, as the powerful wind would potentially tear the tent apart. The mysterious internal injuries that some sustained are explained by a snow den the hikers dug for shelter collapsing on top of them. \n\nBoth theories offer potential solutions for what drove the hikers to suddenly abandon their tent, and why some were so severely injured. Ultimately though, since there were no survivors, many of the questions surrounding the case will likely never be answered. \n\nFurther reading:\nFor all things Dyatlov: dyatlovpass.com \n\nMechanisms of slab avalanche release and impact in the Dyatlov Pass incident in 1959, by Johan Gaume & Alexander M.

                "description": "It\u2019s a simple innovation that helped win a war.\n\nThe Bailey bridge was Donald Bailey\u2019s innovative solution to a number of wartime obstacles. The allies needed a way to cross bodies of water quickly, but bombed-out bridges \u2014 or an absence of crossings entirely \u2014 made that incredibly difficult. That was only compounded by new, heavy tanks that needed incredibly strong support.\n\nBailey\u2019s innovation \u2014 a modular, moveable panel bridge \u2014 solved those problems and gave the allies a huge advantage. The 570-pound steel panel could be lifted by just six men, and the supplies could fit inside small service trucks. Using those manageable materials, soldiers could build crossings sufficient for heavy tanks and other vehicles.\n\nAs impressive, the Bailey bridge could be rolled across a gap from one side to the other, making it possible to build covertly or with little access to the other side. Together, all the Bailey bridge\u2019s advantages changed bridge construction and may have helped win the war.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nJohn A. Thierry\u2019s contemporaneous history of the Bailey Bridge provides a great overview:\nhttp://www.6thcorpscombatengineers.com/docs/engineers/the%20bailey%20bridge%20-%20john%20a%20thierry.pdf\n\nThis Army Manual is a great look at how the Bailey Bridge worked:\nhttps://archive.org/details/DepartmentOfTheArmyTechnicalManualTM5277.PanelBridgeBaileyTypeM2.April1948/\n\nA number of good papers about the Bailey Bridge are also available, though they sit behind a paywall. You can read Bailey\u2019s account of his bridge:\nhttps://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/ciwv1.45170.0022\n\nDenys Begbie and Gwilym Roberts\u2019 paper is a great summary of the Bailey Bridge\u2019s achievements.\nhttps://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/ehah.13.00022\n\nThe same goes for CJH Joiner\u2019s history:\nhttps://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/ehah.10.00002\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "It\u2019s a simple innovation that helped win a war.\n\nThe Bailey bridge was Donald Bailey\u2019s innovative solution to a number of wartime obstacles. The allies needed a way to cross bodies of water quickly, but bombed-out bridges \u2014 or an absence of crossings entirely \u2014 made that incredibly difficult. That was only compounded by new, heavy tanks that needed incredibly strong support.\n\nBailey\u2019s innovation \u2014 a modular, moveable panel bridge \u2014 solved those problems and gave the allies a huge advantage. The 570-pound steel panel could be lifted by just six men, and the supplies could fit inside small service trucks. Using those manageable materials, soldiers could build crossings sufficient for heavy tanks and other vehicles.\n\nAs impressive, the Bailey bridge could be rolled across a gap from one side to the other, making it possible to build covertly or with little access to the other side. Together, all the Bailey bridge\u2019s advantages changed bridge construction and may have helped win the war.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nJohn A. Thierry\u2019s contemporaneous history of the Bailey Bridge provides a great overview:\nhttp://www.6thcorpscombatengineers.com/docs/engineers/the%20bailey%20bridge%20-%20john%20a%20thierry.pdf\n\nThis Army Manual is a great look at how the Bailey Bridge worked:\nhttps://archive.org/details/DepartmentOfTheArmyTechnicalManualTM5277.PanelBridgeBaileyTypeM2.April1948/\n\nA number of good papers about the Bailey Bridge are also available, though they sit behind a paywall. You can read Bailey\u2019s account of his bridge:\nhttps://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/ciwv1.45170.0022\n\nDenys Begbie and Gwilym Roberts\u2019 paper is a great summary of the Bailey Bridge\u2019s achievements.\nhttps://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/ehah.13.00022\n\nThe same goes for CJH Joiner\u2019s history:\nhttps://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/ehah.10.00002\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But the scientists who work most closely with vaccines emphasize that when a vaccination makes you feel sick, it's almost never a bad sign. And once you understand why vaccine side effects happen, you may even be happy to get that headache.\n\nRead more about why the Covid-19 vaccines may feel different from other routine shots: https://www.vox.com/22158238/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects-explained \n\nMuch of the data in this video came from the clinical trial reports for the first two studied vaccines to become available.

But the scientists who work most closely with vaccines emphasize that when a vaccination makes you feel sick, it's almost never a bad sign. And once you understand why vaccine side effects happen, you may even be happy to get that headache.\n\nRead more about why the Covid-19 vaccines may feel different from other routine shots: https://www.vox.com/22158238/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects-explained \n\nMuch of the data in this video came from the clinical trial reports for the first two studied vaccines to become available.

They swing their arms around, turn their heads, and twist their bodies reacting to invisible cues all around them. From outside the headset, you might be able to see their experience on a screen. But it\u2019s hard to believe that they could become so immersed in a virtual world that they lose track of reality around them \u2014 and yet it happens all the time.\n\nThe internet is full of \u201cvirtual reality fails\u201d \u2014 people falling into walls and crashing through their TVs, much to their families' disbelief.

Why?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte is one of history\u2019s most famous figures and has been depicted in countless portraits. Often, paintings show him with one hand concealed inside his shirt. The gesture is a common feature of caricatures and impressions of the conqueror, and its frequent appearance has led to speculation about why he seemed to do it so often. \n\nThe answer is rooted in the gesture\u2019s history. Concealing a hand in one\u2019s coat has long signified gentlemanly restraint, and was often associated with nobility. It goes as far back as ancient Greece, when famed orator Aeschines claimed that restricting the movement of one\u2019s hand was the proper way to speak in public. \n\nPortraits of Napoleon adopting this pose are an example of propaganda \u2014 the most famous version being Jacques-Louis David\u2019s 1812 painting of Napoleon in his study. It portrays the ruler as a modest and hardworking leader, even though outside of France Napoleon was often labeled a tyrant and considered to be ill-tempered. The hand-in-waistcoat gesture became a common way to depict him during his lifetime and long after he died. \n\nThe pose also became a portraiture clich\u00e9 with the advent of photography, thanks to its dignified reputation \u2014 and because it was a good way to sit still during the long exposure times of early photography. \n\nFurther reading: \nRe-dressing Classical Statuary: The Eighteenth-Century \"Hand-in-Waistcoat\" Portrait, by Arline Meyer\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/3046079?seq=1\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Wie im obigen Video zu sehen, bedeutet Monopoly zu spielen, alle Regeln neu zu erlernen, Schl\u00fcsselstrategien zu verinnerlichen und vor allem Deine Mitspieler/innen wertzusch\u00e4tzen.\n\nValentine teilt mit uns sein Wissen \u00fcber Wahrscheinlichkeits-Heatmaps (Diagramme die Aufschluss \u00fcber die Wahrscheinlichkeit geben, auf einem bestimmten Spielfeld zu landen), \u00fcber die Feinheiten von Spielz\u00fcgen rund um H\u00e4user und Hotels, und er bietet sogar ein paar Tipps dazu, wie man Spiele f\u00fcr alle Beteiligten spa\u00dfig und nicht erbittert gestaltet.  \nWeiterf\u00fchrende Literatur:\n\nEs gibt massenweise Artikel, die die Mathematik hinter Monopoly verst\u00e4ndlich erkl\u00e4ren. W\u00e4hrend Mathematik nicht der einzige Bestandteil ist, den man ben\u00f6tigt, um Monopoly richtig zu spielen, ist sie ein extrem wichtiger. Dieser Artikel aus dem Business Insider von Walt Hickey ist eine fantastische Einf\u00fchrung, und dieser Artikel aus Thrillist von Daisy Barringer bietet dar\u00fcber hinaus noch viele weitere gute Tipps.\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/math-monopoly-statistics-2013-6\nhttps://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/how-to-win-at-monopoly-every-time-according-to-experts\n\nF\u00fcr alle, die tiefergehende Informationen zum Thema \u201eMonopoly-Weltmeisterschaften\u201c suchen, empfiehlt sich ein Blick in die Fandom Geschichte dieser Wettk\u00e4mpfe, die auch einen Hinweis auf Valentine\u2019s Auftritt 2015 enth\u00e4lt.\nhttps://monopoly-championship-history.fandom.com/wiki/MONOPOLY_Championship_History_Wiki\n...\nDie meisten Monopoly Top-Spieler treten in die Fu\u00dfstapfen von Philip Orbanes, der einige Monopoly-B\u00fccher geschrieben hat, inklusive des im Folgenden aufgef\u00fchrten Leitfadens. Orbanes\u2018 allgemeine Geschichte des Brettspiels, \u201eThe Game Makers\u201c, bietet ebenfalls spannende Lekt\u00fcre (wenngleich es nicht wirklich um Strategien des Spielablaufs geht).\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/The_Monopoly_Companion.html?id=x42RxZP8VyMC\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/The_Game_Makers.html?id=pxPgwAEACAAJ"

Hundreds of thousands of women marched in defiance of a new court ruling that would outlaw abortions under almost any circumstance.\n\nPoland has long had some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. But in 2015, the right-wing party Law and Justice (PiS) came to power in Poland, and promptly started trying to narrow abortion access in the country even further. In 2016 they attempted to pass a total ban. They failed.\n\nBut in 2020, at the ruling party\u2019s request, Poland\u2019s highest court ruled that almost all abortions were illegal. They did so because Law and Justice had spent the previous few years degrading the court\u2019s independence and turning it into an arm of the party. The protests began immediately, partly because of the ruling itself but also because of what it represents: the risk of losing not only reproductive rights but the country\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\nTo understand why this ruling has driven so many into the streets, and exactly why it threatens Poland\u2019s democracy, watch the video above. \n\nNote: At 1:50, a previous version of this video illustrated a quote from Law & Justice party leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski with a photo of his late twin brother, former president Lech Kaczy\u0144ski.

The protests began immediately, partly because of the ruling itself but also because of what it represents: the risk of losing not only reproductive rights but the country\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\nTo understand why this ruling has driven so many into the streets, and exactly why it threatens Poland\u2019s democracy, watch the video above. \n\nNote: At 1:50, a previous version of this video illustrated a quote from Law & Justice party leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski with a photo of his late twin brother, former president Lech Kaczy\u0144ski.

That emblem is the most enduring and recognizable symbol of the American Civil War, a four-year conflict in which Southern states fought to preserve slavery in the United States. \n\nSince then, the symbol has been used as a banner of Southern pride but is also widely used by white supremacists to honor a time when Black Americans were enslaved. Activists in Mississippi have protested the state flag for decades, and it almost changed in 2001, when an alternative design was presented but failed to get enough votes to replace the old one. \n\nAfter the 2015 massacre of nine Black churchgoers in South Carolina and the uprising in 2020 in response to the murder of George Floyd, Mississippi\u2019s legislature finally abolished the state flag bearing the Confederate emblem. On November 3, 2020, Mississippi voters approved a new flag design that\u2019s more inclusive and reflective of the people across the state.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

That emblem is the most enduring and recognizable symbol of the American Civil War, a four-year conflict in which Southern states fought to preserve slavery in the United States. \n\nSince then, the symbol has been used as a banner of Southern pride but is also widely used by white supremacists to honor a time when Black Americans were enslaved. Activists in Mississippi have protested the state flag for decades, and it almost changed in 2001, when an alternative design was presented but failed to get enough votes to replace the old one. \n\nAfter the 2015 massacre of nine Black churchgoers in South Carolina and the uprising in 2020 in response to the murder of George Floyd, Mississippi\u2019s legislature finally abolished the state flag bearing the Confederate emblem. On November 3, 2020, Mississippi voters approved a new flag design that\u2019s more inclusive and reflective of the people across the state.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It was all part of a campaign to cast doubt on the legality of mail-in ballots, which disproportionately favored Joe Biden. The lawsuits themselves likely won\u2019t alter the course of the election.

But the future of election law under a new US Supreme Court is a different story. \n \nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n \nWhen Joe Biden won the US Presidential election, President Donald Trump threatened legal action in some of the battleground states that were among the last to count their ballots. It was all part of a campaign to cast doubt on the legality of mail-in ballots, which disproportionately favored Joe Biden. The lawsuits themselves likely won\u2019t alter the course of the election. But one in Pennsylvania sheds light on how the current US Supreme Court might rule on future election laws. \n\nFor Vox's coverage on this: \n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/11/3/21546419/supreme-court-2020-election-question-pennslyvania-minnesota-texas-north-carolina\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/11/6/21552720/trump-2020-campaign-election-irregularities-fraud\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21551983/supreme-court-donald-trump-election-amy-coney-barrett-steal-bush-gore\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21550772/trump-lawsuits-vote-counting-pennsylvania-georgia-michigan\n \nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Whether you\u2019re voting in person early, on election day, by mail, or dropping off your ballot, we break down some of the differences and similarities in how and when states collect, verify, process, and count ballots.\n\nOnce you understand how votes are counted, it\u2019s clear just how important each vote really is.\n\n\nFurther reading:\nVoting by mail and absentee voting (MIT Election Data and Science Lab)\nhttps://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voting-mail-and-absentee-voting\n\nDemocracy Diverted: Polling Place Closures and the Right to Vote (The Leadership Conference Education Fund)\nhttp://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/reports/Democracy-Diverted.pdf\n\nElection night marks the end of one phase of campaign 2020 \u2013 and the start of another (Pew)\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/22/election-night-marks-the-end-of-one-phase-of-campaign-2020-and-the-start-of-another/\n\nHow Quickly Will Your Absentee Vote Be Counted?

                "description": "Why some Americans\u2019 votes count more than others.\n\nWatch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos\n\nIn the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America\u2019s head of state called the Electoral College.\n\nThe Electoral College is the reason the US has something called \u201cswing states,\u201d and it\u2019s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It\u2019s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country\u2019s biggest cities. And more recently, it\u2019s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.\n\nThe Electoral College makes some Americans\u2019 votes more powerful than others. In fact, that\u2019s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country\u2019s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.\n\nFurther reading:\nThe historian Alexander Keyssar\u2019s book \u201cWhy Do We Still Have the Electoral College?\u201d takes you through the history and function of the Electoral College: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660151\n\nFor the bite-sized version of that history, Keyssar also wrote this piece in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/electoral-college-racism-white-supremacy.html\n\nThe Times also had a great interactive feature on where the 2020 candidates actually spent money: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html\n\nPew has a breakdown of how democracies around the world elect their head of state, which really shows what an oddball the US is: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/22/among-democracies-u-s-stands-out-in-how-it-chooses-its-head-of-state/\n\nMore on why today\u2019s Electoral College gives Republican presidential candidates a structural advantage: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/17/20868790/republicans-lose-popular-vote-win-electoral-college\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "Why some Americans\u2019 votes count more than others.\n\nWatch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos\n\nIn the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America\u2019s head of state called the Electoral College.\n\nThe Electoral College is the reason the US has something called \u201cswing states,\u201d and it\u2019s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It\u2019s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country\u2019s biggest cities. And more recently, it\u2019s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.\n\nThe Electoral College makes some Americans\u2019 votes more powerful than others. In fact, that\u2019s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country\u2019s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.\n\nFurther reading:\nThe historian Alexander Keyssar\u2019s book \u201cWhy Do We Still Have the Electoral College?\u201d takes you through the history and function of the Electoral College: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660151\n\nFor the bite-sized version of that history, Keyssar also wrote this piece in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/electoral-college-racism-white-supremacy.html\n\nThe Times also had a great interactive feature on where the 2020 candidates actually spent money: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html\n\nPew has a breakdown of how democracies around the world elect their head of state, which really shows what an oddball the US is: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/22/among-democracies-u-s-stands-out-in-how-it-chooses-its-head-of-state/\n\nMore on why today\u2019s Electoral College gives Republican presidential candidates a structural advantage: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/17/20868790/republicans-lose-popular-vote-win-electoral-college\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

They feature bright pastel colors with trendy fonts spelling out taglines like \u201cwake up\u201d and \u201cget loud.\u201d \n\nWhat the people who see these hashtags \u2014\u00a0and the lifestyle influencers who often post them \u2014\u00a0might not know is that the hashtag is being used to bring QAnon ideas into the mainstream. In March, 23 percent of people surveyed by Pew had heard of QAnon;\u00a0by September, that number had risen to 47 percent. Now the conspiracy theory has reached a bigger support base than ever before via QAnon-lite memes \u2014 with serious implications for the election. \n\nRead more of Vox's coverage on QAnon: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/1/17253444/qanon-trump-conspiracy-theory-4chan-explainer\n\nAnd on how it spread to a new audience: https://www.vox.com/21436671/save-our-children-hashtag-qanon-pizzagate\n\nOpen Sourced is a year-long reporting project from Recode by Vox that goes deep into the closed ecosystems of data, privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.

Vox's Phil Edwards spoke to her about her career and how it's at the forefront of a big technological shift. As a compositor for venerable effects house Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), she\u2019s worked on films like The Last Jedi, assembling various digital elements into a beautiful, seamless image.

                "description": "Most Americans have no choice but to drive. How do we change that?\n\nWatch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.\n\nThis sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.\n\nThe result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country\u2019s carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.\n\nThis was the seventh in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

                    "description": "Most Americans have no choice but to drive. How do we change that?\n\nWatch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.\n\nThis sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.\n\nThe result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country\u2019s carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.\n\nThis was the seventh in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

It turned to Navajo Nation, where the uranium mining industry thrived for four decades --  but left disease, pollution and the biggest radioactive spill in US history. \n\nThat spill in Church Rock, New Mexico upended the lives of nearby residents, who had to grapple with toxic water, livestock and a lifetime of illnesses. Now, they are still waiting for it to be cleaned up.\n\nNote: The headline for this piece has been updated. \nPrevious headline: The biggest radioactive spill in US history\n\nHave an idea for a story that we should investigate for Missing Chapter?

But for the last half of the 19th century, photos made \u2014 and carefully hand-colored \u2014 in Japanese photo studios were important documents for how the world came to know Japanese culture. \n\nFurther reading:\nA Good Type: Tourism and Science in Early Japanese Photographs, by David Odo\nhttps://www.peabody.harvard.edu/node/2080\n\nSites of \u201cDisconnectedness\u201d: The Port City of Yokohama, Souvenir Photography, and its Audience, by Mio Wakita-Elis\nhttps://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/11067/5640\n\nPhotography in Japan 1853-1912, by Terry Bennett\nhttps://www.tuttlepublishing.com/books-by-country/photography-in-japan-1853-1912-hardcover-with-jacket\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

If so, it would be a repeat of their tactics four years ago, when Russian operatives posing as Americans on social media discouraged Black Americans from voting or encouraged them to vote for the third-party candidate, Jill Stein. The Trump campaign itself pursued a strategy of vote suppression targeted at African Americans, who vote against Republicans at higher rates than any other demographic group. \n\nWhile voter suppression takes many forms \u2014 from intimidation at polling places to purges of voter rolls to strict ID requirements \u2014 this video focuses on digital voter suppression, where the goal is to infiltrate communities online and deliver covert messages that discourage participation in elections. We explain what those messages look like, and why they so often target Black voters.\n\nOpen Sourced is a year-long reporting project from Recode by Vox that goes deep into the closed ecosystems of data, privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.

If so, it would be a repeat of their tactics four years ago, when Russian operatives posing as Americans on social media discouraged Black Americans from voting or encouraged them to vote for the third-party candidate, Jill Stein. The Trump campaign itself pursued a strategy of vote suppression targeted at African Americans, who vote against Republicans at higher rates than any other demographic group. \n\nWhile voter suppression takes many forms \u2014 from intimidation at polling places to purges of voter rolls to strict ID requirements \u2014 this video focuses on digital voter suppression, where the goal is to infiltrate communities online and deliver covert messages that discourage participation in elections. We explain what those messages look like, and why they so often target Black voters.\n\nOpen Sourced is a year-long reporting project from Recode by Vox that goes deep into the closed ecosystems of data, privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.

                "description": "The sneaky ways that some US states make it harder to vote.\n\nWatch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos \n\nThe process of voting isn\u2019t the same for all Americans. Depending on where you live, you might vote on a screen, a punchcard, or a piece of paper. You might have to show an ID to vote, or you might not. And you might have to wait a long time, or you might not.\n\nSome of these differences don\u2019t really matter. But some of them make voting harder. And sometimes they can keep people from voting altogether. For decades, the US had a civil rights law that made sure those differences were fair, and didn\u2019t disproportionately keep certain people from voting: the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But in 2013, the US Supreme Court gutted that law, allowing states to pass a slew of new voting laws.\n\nThose new laws often had the effect of making it harder for poor people and people of color to vote. And the 2020 US election will be shaped in part by those laws. But the same election will also decide the future of those laws.\n\nThis was the second in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

                    "description": "The sneaky ways that some US states make it harder to vote.\n\nWatch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos \n\nThe process of voting isn\u2019t the same for all Americans. Depending on where you live, you might vote on a screen, a punchcard, or a piece of paper. You might have to show an ID to vote, or you might not. And you might have to wait a long time, or you might not.\n\nSome of these differences don\u2019t really matter. But some of them make voting harder. And sometimes they can keep people from voting altogether. For decades, the US had a civil rights law that made sure those differences were fair, and didn\u2019t disproportionately keep certain people from voting: the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But in 2013, the US Supreme Court gutted that law, allowing states to pass a slew of new voting laws.\n\nThose new laws often had the effect of making it harder for poor people and people of color to vote. And the 2020 US election will be shaped in part by those laws. But the same election will also decide the future of those laws.\n\nThis was the second in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

But the burning of fossil fuels has triggered a temperature rise projected to exceed 3 degrees by the end of the century. It will be catastrophic. But it can be avoided if we massively scale back the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nThe US isn\u2019t the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, but it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country. So the US has an important role to play in global decarbonization; the world basically can\u2019t get there without the US\u2019s full participation. But the current US president doesn\u2019t have any plans to do that. His Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, does.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan is ambitious: Its goal is to completely transition the US to clean energy by 2050. But his plan doesn\u2019t get into the details of exactly how that will happen. For that, we talked to physicist and engineer Saul Griffith, who took us through his incredibly detailed road map for how the US could actually walk away from fossil fuels in the next 30 years.\n\nThis was the first in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

                    "description": "And what the US election means for climate change.\n\nWatch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos \n\nAll of recorded human history has happened during a period in which the average global temperature didn\u2019t change by more than 1 degree Celsius. But the burning of fossil fuels has triggered a temperature rise projected to exceed 3 degrees by the end of the century. It will be catastrophic. But it can be avoided if we massively scale back the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nThe US isn\u2019t the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, but it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country. So the US has an important role to play in global decarbonization; the world basically can\u2019t get there without the US\u2019s full participation. But the current US president doesn\u2019t have any plans to do that. His Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, does.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan is ambitious: Its goal is to completely transition the US to clean energy by 2050. But his plan doesn\u2019t get into the details of exactly how that will happen. For that, we talked to physicist and engineer Saul Griffith, who took us through his incredibly detailed road map for how the US could actually walk away from fossil fuels in the next 30 years.\n\nThis was the first in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

How do they make sense of these deaths and the systemic factors that made them possible?  \n\nIn June of 2020,11-year-old Californian Jolia Bossette decided to use her fifth-grade graduation speech as an occasion to give voice to her thoughts and feelings. In her speech, she reminisced about how she was \"the cutest thing,\" as a toddler and asked, \"But when did I stop being cute and start being scary?\"\n\n\"Does my dad scare you? Does my mom scare you? Does my auntie scare you? Because let me tell you something: We are not scary.\"\n\nCheck out Vox\u2019s Today Explained podcast, which features a great episode for all ages about racial justice in the US: https://www.vox.com/2020/8/29/21404446/systemic-racism-explained-to-kids\n\nHistorian Michael Kazin explains how the Black Lives Matter movement fits into the tradition of American political and cultural movements, (Vox): https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21306771/black-lives-matter-george-floyd-protest-michael-kazin\n\nWe designed these episodes for kids ages 9-13, but we hope all of our audience enjoys them!

                    "description": "Eleven-year-old Jolia Bossette on being a Black kid in America.\n\nWelcome to our first-ever week of programming for kids! \n\nThe killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and hundreds of other Black Americans at the hands of police officers have inspired protests across the country and around the world.\n\nThe news coverage has been impossible for most of us to ignore, and it begs the question: How are kids, especially Black kids, processing this reality? How do they make sense of these deaths and the systemic factors that made them possible?  \n\nIn June of 2020,11-year-old Californian Jolia Bossette decided to use her fifth-grade graduation speech as an occasion to give voice to her thoughts and feelings. In her speech, she reminisced about how she was \"the cutest thing,\" as a toddler and asked, \"But when did I stop being cute and start being scary?\"\n\n\"Does my dad scare you? Does my mom scare you? Does my auntie scare you? Because let me tell you something: We are not scary.\"\n\nCheck out Vox\u2019s Today Explained podcast, which features a great episode for all ages about racial justice in the US: https://www.vox.com/2020/8/29/21404446/systemic-racism-explained-to-kids\n\nHistorian Michael Kazin explains how the Black Lives Matter movement fits into the tradition of American political and cultural movements, (Vox): https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21306771/black-lives-matter-george-floyd-protest-michael-kazin\n\nWe designed these episodes for kids ages 9-13, but we hope all of our audience enjoys them!

Jones and Daina Ramey Berry reflect on what the 19th Amendment means for Black American women. The women\u2019s suffrage movement was a predominantly white cause, one that sacrificed the involvement of Black suffragists in return for support for the 19th Amendment from Southern states. \n\nThe 1920 legislation enfranchised all American women, but it left Black women, particularly those living in the South, to fight racial discrimination when registering to vote and going to the polls. It wasn\u2019t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that this type of racial discrimination was prohibited by federal law. \n\nThe voting rights fight is still not over, however. There\u2019s evidence that restrictions to voting disproportionately affect minority populations \u2014 measures like voter ID laws, voting purges, gerrymandering, and closing polling locations. \n\nThe headline to this video has been changed. Previously it was titled: The myth of the 19th amendment\n\nFor more of Vox\u2019s coverage on the anniversary of the 19th Amendment: \n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/8/18/21358913/19th-amendment-ratified-anniversary-women-suffrage-vote\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/21356259/19th-amendment-suffragists-alice-paul-pankhursts\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21364998/19th-amendment-women-equal-pay-economy-poverty-maternity-leave\n\nFor Martha S.

Jones and Daina Ramey Berry reflect on what the 19th Amendment means for Black American women. The women\u2019s suffrage movement was a predominantly white cause, one that sacrificed the involvement of Black suffragists in return for support for the 19th Amendment from Southern states. \n\nThe 1920 legislation enfranchised all American women, but it left Black women, particularly those living in the South, to fight racial discrimination when registering to vote and going to the polls. It wasn\u2019t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that this type of racial discrimination was prohibited by federal law. \n\nThe voting rights fight is still not over, however. There\u2019s evidence that restrictions to voting disproportionately affect minority populations \u2014 measures like voter ID laws, voting purges, gerrymandering, and closing polling locations. \n\nThe headline to this video has been changed. Previously it was titled: The myth of the 19th amendment\n\nFor more of Vox\u2019s coverage on the anniversary of the 19th Amendment: \n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/8/18/21358913/19th-amendment-ratified-anniversary-women-suffrage-vote\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/21356259/19th-amendment-suffragists-alice-paul-pankhursts\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21364998/19th-amendment-women-equal-pay-economy-poverty-maternity-leave\n\nFor Martha S.

While meat was once mostly raised on small farms, today almost all the meat we eat comes from industrialized \u201cfactory\u201d farms, known as \u201cconcentrated animal feeding operations,\u201d or CAFOs. Animals in CAFOs are often packed closely together, which makes them both efficient and, for many, ethically dubious. But infectious disease experts worry about CAFOs for a different reason: Because they\u2019re also an ideal environment for virus and bacteria mutations that human immune systems have never seen. In other words, they\u2019re a highly likely source for the next pandemic.\n\nYou can read more about the pathogen risks in factory farming at Vox.com: \nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/22/21228158/coronavirus-pandemic-risk-factory-farming-meat\n\nA deeper look at the threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria: \nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/7/18535480/drug-resistance-antibiotics-un-report\n\nFurther reading on how RNA virus reassortment works: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5119462/\n\nMartha Nelson's study tracking the origins of the 2009 H1N1 virus: \nhttps://elifesciences.org/articles/16777\n\nRead more about the sources of meat produced around the world from the Sentience Institute: https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/global-animal-farming-estimates\n\nThe US Center for Disease Control's timeline of the H1N1 pandemic: https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/cdcresponse.htm\n\nA hopeful look at where factory farming might be headed in the US:\nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/20/21028200/factory-farms-abuse-workers-animals-and-the-environment-cory-booker-has-a-plan-to-stop-them\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

While meat was once mostly raised on small farms, today almost all the meat we eat comes from industrialized \u201cfactory\u201d farms, known as \u201cconcentrated animal feeding operations,\u201d or CAFOs. Animals in CAFOs are often packed closely together, which makes them both efficient and, for many, ethically dubious. But infectious disease experts worry about CAFOs for a different reason: Because they\u2019re also an ideal environment for virus and bacteria mutations that human immune systems have never seen. In other words, they\u2019re a highly likely source for the next pandemic.\n\nYou can read more about the pathogen risks in factory farming at Vox.com: \nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/22/21228158/coronavirus-pandemic-risk-factory-farming-meat\n\nA deeper look at the threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria: \nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/7/18535480/drug-resistance-antibiotics-un-report\n\nFurther reading on how RNA virus reassortment works: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5119462/\n\nMartha Nelson's study tracking the origins of the 2009 H1N1 virus: \nhttps://elifesciences.org/articles/16777\n\nRead more about the sources of meat produced around the world from the Sentience Institute: https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/global-animal-farming-estimates\n\nThe US Center for Disease Control's timeline of the H1N1 pandemic: https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/cdcresponse.htm\n\nA hopeful look at where factory farming might be headed in the US:\nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/20/21028200/factory-farms-abuse-workers-animals-and-the-environment-cory-booker-has-a-plan-to-stop-them\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

In recent years, many of the countries missing their cultural heritage have been asking for some of these items back. \n\nBenin City in Nigeria is one of those places. They've been calling for the return of the Benin Bronzes, hundreds of artifacts looted in 1897 when British soldiers embarked a punitive expedition to Benin. Many are now housed in the British Museum. \n\nAnd it's just the beginning. As the world reckons with the damage inflicted during Europe\u2019s colonial global takeover, the calls for these items to be returned are getting louder and louder. \n\nTo dig deeper into the 1897 Benin Punitive Expedition and the Benin Bronzes check out this book by Staffan Lunden:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/28886529/Displaying_Loot_The_Benin_objects_and_the_British_Museum\n\nAnd this article in the Journal of African History by Philip A.

In recent years, many of the countries missing their cultural heritage have been asking for some of these items back. \n\nBenin City in Nigeria is one of those places. They've been calling for the return of the Benin Bronzes, hundreds of artifacts looted in 1897 when British soldiers embarked a punitive expedition to Benin. Many are now housed in the British Museum. \n\nAnd it's just the beginning. As the world reckons with the damage inflicted during Europe\u2019s colonial global takeover, the calls for these items to be returned are getting louder and louder. \n\nTo dig deeper into the 1897 Benin Punitive Expedition and the Benin Bronzes check out this book by Staffan Lunden:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/28886529/Displaying_Loot_The_Benin_objects_and_the_British_Museum\n\nAnd this article in the Journal of African History by Philip A.

It's now more difficult for an unscrupulous advertiser to use Facebook's platform to discriminate. \n\nHowever, even when you remove human bias from the system, Facebook's ad delivery algorithms can result in biased outcomes. According to research from Northeastern University, Facebook sometimes displays ads to highly skewed audiences based on the content of the ad. \n\nBy purchasing ads and inputting neutral targeting options, the researchers found that the algorithmically determined audience for job ads for cleaners, secretaries, nurses, and preschool teachers was mostly women. The job ads for fast food workers, supermarket cashiers, and taxi drivers skewed toward Black users. The studies show that by targeting \"relevant\" users, these systems can reinforce existing disparities in our interests and our opportunities. \n\nSources:\nDiscrimination through optimization: How Facebook's ad delivery can lead to skewed outcomes. https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02095 \nAd Delivery Algorithms: The Hidden Arbiters of Political Messaging https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04255.pdf \nHUD v.

It's now more difficult for an unscrupulous advertiser to use Facebook's platform to discriminate. \n\nHowever, even when you remove human bias from the system, Facebook's ad delivery algorithms can result in biased outcomes. According to research from Northeastern University, Facebook sometimes displays ads to highly skewed audiences based on the content of the ad. \n\nBy purchasing ads and inputting neutral targeting options, the researchers found that the algorithmically determined audience for job ads for cleaners, secretaries, nurses, and preschool teachers was mostly women. The job ads for fast food workers, supermarket cashiers, and taxi drivers skewed toward Black users. The studies show that by targeting \"relevant\" users, these systems can reinforce existing disparities in our interests and our opportunities. \n\nSources:\nDiscrimination through optimization: How Facebook's ad delivery can lead to skewed outcomes. https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02095 \nAd Delivery Algorithms: The Hidden Arbiters of Political Messaging https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04255.pdf \nHUD v.

And it probably won\u2019t stop anytime soon.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThis issue of American Cinematographer is a time capsule look at the adoption of the key sound film technology used in early movies, Vitaphone.\nhttps://archive.org/details/americancinemato07amer/page/n37/mode/2up?q=24\n\nMost academic writing that touches on slow-mo focuses on individual filmmakers, like this essay by scholar Ludovic Cortade.\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46n14t.13?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\n\nFinally, if you really want to nerd out on film history, this is a copy of the Transactions of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, in which they started developing a frame rate standard and discussed synchronization of sound and film.\nhttps://archive.org/details/transactionsofso29soci/page/294/\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                "description": "Washington, DC is closer than ever to becoming a state. Could it actually happen?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nOn June 26, 2020, the US House of Representatives voted to make America\u2019s capital city, Washington, DC, the country\u2019s 51st state. It was a historic vote, and the closest the country has come to adding a new state in over 60 years. But it was also, for the time being, completely symbolic. Because at least in 2020, DC has no chance of actually becoming a state.\n\nThat June 26 vote was almost entirely along party lines; Democrats mostly voted in favor of DC statehood, and Republicans against it. That\u2019s because making DC a state would give the Democrats additional seats in Congress, potentially affecting the balance of power between the parties. It\u2019s why President Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate have both promised to strike down any bid for DC statehood. And in fact, statehood in the US has always been a political issue. In the past, the US has often added states in pairs to preserve the political balance. Admitting a new state on its own has happened, but it\u2019s unusual.\n\nBut the case for DC statehood is strong: The city has a similar population to several states, its hundreds of thousands of residents lack any say in national lawmaking, and its local government is uniquely vulnerable to being strong-armed by Congress and the federal government. Simply put, the laws that created the district did not anticipate that it would one day be a major city. And while in 1993, the last time Congress voted on DC statehood, the Democratic-controlled House failed to pass it, today\u2019s Democratic Party is increasingly on board with it. If 2020\u2019s election puts the Democrats in full control of the federal government, America might actually get its 51st state.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nMore on how the US has added new states in the past:\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/9/18/20863026/dc-statehood-george-floyd-puerto-rico-statehood\n\nWhat it would take for DC to become a state:\nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/6/22/21293168/dc-statehood-vote-filibuster-supreme-court-joe-biden\n\nHow Congress has interfered with DC:\nhttps://www.dcvote.org/ending-congressional-interference\n\nAnd a history of why the idea of a federal district is written in the constitution:\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/reference/united-states-history/why-washington-dc-not-state-started-drunken-mob/\n\nNote: The headline on this piece has been updated.\nPrevious headline: Why Washington, DC isn't a state\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It's why scientists are racing to find out how close it is to total collapse - and what that would mean for future sea levels. \n\nFurther Reading:\n\nThe Doomsday Glacier, Rolling Stone Magazine: \nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/the-doomsday-glacier-113792/\n\nThe Race to Understand Antarctica's Most Terrifying Glacier, Wired:\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-breaking-point/\n\nInto the Thaw, PRI\nhttps://www.pri.org/categories/thaw-decoding-thwaites-glacier\n\nInternational Thwaites Glacier Collaboration:\nhttps://thwaitesglacier.org/\n\nDustin Schroeder, Stanford University:\nhttps://earth.stanford.edu/people/dustin-schroeder\n\nSridhar Anandakrishnan, Penn State University\nhttps://www.geosc.psu.edu/academic-faculty/anandakrishnan-sridhar\n\nVox Atlas demonstrates where conflicts occur on a map and the ways in which foreign policy shapes a region.

The police are rarely held accountable.\n \nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n \nOn May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers killed an unarmed black man named George Floyd. After video of Floyd\u2019s death spread on the internet, protesters filled the streets across the US, demanding an end to police brutality and a reckoning with the unequal treatment of Black Americans, but also with another, more direct demand: That his killers be punished.\n \nUntil recent years, there was no reliable data on how many people in the US were killed by police every year, or on the legal outcomes of those killings. But data collected by the Mapping Police Violence project provides some answers, including one that has held steady every year for which we have data: Police are almost never charged with killing someone, and are even less often convicted.\n \nThe data shows that less than 3% of police killings lead to the officer being charged with a crime, and fewer than 1% of them result in a conviction, and that these rates are the same regardless of the victim\u2019s race. But it also shows that a Black American is three times more likely to be killed by police than a white American.\n \nHere\u2019s Mapping Police Violence\u2019s data, which we rely on throughout the video: \nhttps://mappingpoliceviolence.org/\n \nThe Washington Post also keeps a record of deaths caused by police shootings, which had similar findings: \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/\n \nAn interview with a historian on the history on police brutality: \nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/6/6/21280643/police-brutality-violence-protests-racism-khalil-muhammad\n \nVox also interviewed experts on ways to reform American policing: \nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/6/1/21277013/police-reform-policies-systemic-racism-george-floyd\n\nThe headline for this video has been updated, it was changed from: A timeline of 1,944 Black Americans killed by police. \n \nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

To find out how to get three months free, click here: http://ExpressVPN.com/Vox\nIn a region where food is already scarce, billions of insects are now eating everything in sight.\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nSince late 2019, East Africa and the Middle East have been experiencing their worst locust outbreaks in decades. A small locust swarm can eat more food than 35,000 people; but some locust swarms in the area have grown to over two thousand times that size. And it\u2019s all coming right on the heels of a season of catastrophic flooding in the region.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t a coincidence: The desert locust thrives when dry weather turns wet. And in 2018 and 2019, a series of freak weather events brought record-setting rainfall to the Middle East and East Africa. The result of all this is a region at risk of a famine, in the middle of a pandemic. And because freak weather is a hallmark of climate change, it\u2019s also the kind of thing we can expect to happen again.\n\nFurther reading / watching:\n\nRead Vox.com science reporter Umair Irfan\u2019s article on the locust outbreak:\nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/5/20/21158283/locust-plague-swarm-outbreak-africa-asia-2020\n\nOne of the things that helped prime the region for locusts was an unusually strong Indian Ocean Dipole. Watch our piece about that here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYX9ahqceAI\n\nFor more information on the locust upsurge, see the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s website:\nhttp://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/986/index.html\n\nAnd this FAO press conference from February helped me answer a lot of the questions in this piece:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HEKBAack9g\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

To find out how to get three months free, click here: http://ExpressVPN.com/Vox\nIn a region where food is already scarce, billions of insects are now eating everything in sight.\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nSince late 2019, East Africa and the Middle East have been experiencing their worst locust outbreaks in decades. A small locust swarm can eat more food than 35,000 people; but some locust swarms in the area have grown to over two thousand times that size. And it\u2019s all coming right on the heels of a season of catastrophic flooding in the region.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t a coincidence: The desert locust thrives when dry weather turns wet. And in 2018 and 2019, a series of freak weather events brought record-setting rainfall to the Middle East and East Africa. The result of all this is a region at risk of a famine, in the middle of a pandemic. And because freak weather is a hallmark of climate change, it\u2019s also the kind of thing we can expect to happen again.\n\nFurther reading / watching:\n\nRead Vox.com science reporter Umair Irfan\u2019s article on the locust outbreak:\nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/5/20/21158283/locust-plague-swarm-outbreak-africa-asia-2020\n\nOne of the things that helped prime the region for locusts was an unusually strong Indian Ocean Dipole. Watch our piece about that here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYX9ahqceAI\n\nFor more information on the locust upsurge, see the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s website:\nhttp://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/986/index.html\n\nAnd this FAO press conference from February helped me answer a lot of the questions in this piece:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HEKBAack9g\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Take milk, for example. Dairy farmers across the country have dumped millions of gallons of fresh milk. This, at a time when millions of Americans are dealing with food insecurity. Since so many schools and businesses are now closed, dairy farmers have nowhere to direct those products.

Check them out at http://buyraycon.com/vox\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nAlbert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, published in 1915, defined gravity as the influence of massive objects, like planets and stars, curving space around them. This was very different from the way Isaac Newton had defined gravity over 200 years earlier: Newton described an attracting force that kept planets and stars in orbit with each other. If Einstein was right, then light would also bend near massive objects. And in 1919, two British expeditions set out to test it by photographing a total solar eclipse. By comparing the position of stars with the sun in front of them and another with the sun elsewhere, Arthur Eddington and his team proved that the stars\u2019 apparent positions moved during the eclipse. This was the first, but not the last time Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity was tested and proven, and Einstein became a celebrity overnight. He remained a pop culture icon for the rest of his life. \n\nFurther reading: \nA determination of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field, from observations made at the total eclipse of May 29, 1919 (Dyson, Eddington, Davidson, 1920):\nhttp://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~kalas/labs/documents/dyson1920.pdf\nEclipse 1919.org:\nhttps://eclipse1919.org/\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

Check them out at http://buyraycon.com/vox\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nAlbert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, published in 1915, defined gravity as the influence of massive objects, like planets and stars, curving space around them. This was very different from the way Isaac Newton had defined gravity over 200 years earlier: Newton described an attracting force that kept planets and stars in orbit with each other. If Einstein was right, then light would also bend near massive objects. And in 1919, two British expeditions set out to test it by photographing a total solar eclipse. By comparing the position of stars with the sun in front of them and another with the sun elsewhere, Arthur Eddington and his team proved that the stars\u2019 apparent positions moved during the eclipse. This was the first, but not the last time Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity was tested and proven, and Einstein became a celebrity overnight. He remained a pop culture icon for the rest of his life. \n\nFurther reading: \nA determination of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field, from observations made at the total eclipse of May 29, 1919 (Dyson, Eddington, Davidson, 1920):\nhttp://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~kalas/labs/documents/dyson1920.pdf\nEclipse 1919.org:\nhttps://eclipse1919.org/\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

While there are many different factors at play behind the stark racial disparities \u2014 there\u2019s one possible reason that\u2019s been lurking in the air for decades: pollution. \n\nThe long history of segregation and housing discrimination has long put black people at greater risk of living near chemical plants, factories and highways, exposing them to higher levels of air pollutants. These pollutants have had a chronically negative impact on health, leading to conditions like hypertension and asthma. Now, those same diseases are associated with severe cases of Covid-19, and showing that where you live can determine whether you survive from Covid-19.\n\nRead the full study on air pollution exposure and Covid-19 mortality: https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/covid-pm \n\nRead the study on historic redlining and emergency room visits due to asthma: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(19)30241-4/fulltext\n\nRead the study on Disparities in Distribution of Particulate Matter Emission Sources by Race and Poverty Status: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844406/\n\nTo learn more about the experiences of residents in St. John the Baptist Parish, check out the Concerned Citizens of St. John website: https://www.ccosj.com/\n\nTo learn more about some of the air pollution risks in the Midwest, check out the Environmental Law & Policy Center: http://elpc.org/.

While there are many different factors at play behind the stark racial disparities \u2014 there\u2019s one possible reason that\u2019s been lurking in the air for decades: pollution. \n\nThe long history of segregation and housing discrimination has long put black people at greater risk of living near chemical plants, factories and highways, exposing them to higher levels of air pollutants. These pollutants have had a chronically negative impact on health, leading to conditions like hypertension and asthma. Now, those same diseases are associated with severe cases of Covid-19, and showing that where you live can determine whether you survive from Covid-19.\n\nRead the full study on air pollution exposure and Covid-19 mortality: https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/covid-pm \n\nRead the study on historic redlining and emergency room visits due to asthma: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(19)30241-4/fulltext\n\nRead the study on Disparities in Distribution of Particulate Matter Emission Sources by Race and Poverty Status: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844406/\n\nTo learn more about the experiences of residents in St. John the Baptist Parish, check out the Concerned Citizens of St. John website: https://www.ccosj.com/\n\nTo learn more about some of the air pollution risks in the Midwest, check out the Environmental Law & Policy Center: http://elpc.org/.

But the guidelines on whether you should wear a face mask as part of that fight are often completely different from place to place. That means that, for a lot of people, whether you wear a face mask when you leave the house is basically up to you.\n\nHere\u2019s where almost every expert agrees: If you have Covid-19, and you leave the house, you should wear a mask. Masks help keep sick people from spreading their germs. Most of the uncertainty around mask use is related to a totally separate question: Whether masks can protect healthy people from getting Covid-19.\n\nThe truth is that no mask can actually guarantee that you won\u2019t get sick; experts say one of the most dangerous assumptions about face masks is that they basically make you invincible. Masks have to be used correctly to offer any protection at all, and they\u2019re most effective if used alongside other preventative measures like hand-washing and social distancing.\n\nBut experts also say that the question of whether healthy people should wear masks is a lot easier to answer when you consider one of Covid-19\u2019s most dangerous characteristics: Because of the disease\u2019s long incubation period, and the high occurrence of infected people who never feel symptoms at all, it\u2019s almost impossible to be completely sure that you don\u2019t already have it. And that means the safest course of action is ultimately for everyone to behave like a sick person; in other words, to wear a mask.\n\nMore of Vox.com's coverage of face masks: https://www.vox.com/2020/3/31/21198132/coronavirus-covid-face-masks-n95-respirator-ppe-shortage\n\nAn in-depth explainer on viral respiratory particle behavior and covid-19 transmission: https://medium.com/@Cancerwarrior/covid-19-why-we-should-all-wear-masks-there-is-new-scientific-rationale-280e08ceee71\n\nThe US Center for Disease Control's current guidance on face masks: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Ftransmission.html\n\nAn MIT disease transmission researcher's study on respiratory droplets and aerosols: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852\n\nEd Yong's great explainer on the confusion around face masks: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/\n\nFor the full Schlieren mirror video from Bauhaus University, Weimar: https://vimeo.com/399120258\n\nThe World Health Organization's updated recommendations on face mask use: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\n\nOur source for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases: https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/new-study-on-COVID-19-estimates-5-days-for-incubation-period.html\n\nThe headline on this piece has been updated.

But the guidelines on whether you should wear a face mask as part of that fight are often completely different from place to place. That means that, for a lot of people, whether you wear a face mask when you leave the house is basically up to you.\n\nHere\u2019s where almost every expert agrees: If you have Covid-19, and you leave the house, you should wear a mask. Masks help keep sick people from spreading their germs. Most of the uncertainty around mask use is related to a totally separate question: Whether masks can protect healthy people from getting Covid-19.\n\nThe truth is that no mask can actually guarantee that you won\u2019t get sick; experts say one of the most dangerous assumptions about face masks is that they basically make you invincible. Masks have to be used correctly to offer any protection at all, and they\u2019re most effective if used alongside other preventative measures like hand-washing and social distancing.\n\nBut experts also say that the question of whether healthy people should wear masks is a lot easier to answer when you consider one of Covid-19\u2019s most dangerous characteristics: Because of the disease\u2019s long incubation period, and the high occurrence of infected people who never feel symptoms at all, it\u2019s almost impossible to be completely sure that you don\u2019t already have it. And that means the safest course of action is ultimately for everyone to behave like a sick person; in other words, to wear a mask.\n\nMore of Vox.com's coverage of face masks: https://www.vox.com/2020/3/31/21198132/coronavirus-covid-face-masks-n95-respirator-ppe-shortage\n\nAn in-depth explainer on viral respiratory particle behavior and covid-19 transmission: https://medium.com/@Cancerwarrior/covid-19-why-we-should-all-wear-masks-there-is-new-scientific-rationale-280e08ceee71\n\nThe US Center for Disease Control's current guidance on face masks: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Ftransmission.html\n\nAn MIT disease transmission researcher's study on respiratory droplets and aerosols: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852\n\nEd Yong's great explainer on the confusion around face masks: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/\n\nFor the full Schlieren mirror video from Bauhaus University, Weimar: https://vimeo.com/399120258\n\nThe World Health Organization's updated recommendations on face mask use: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\n\nOur source for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases: https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/new-study-on-COVID-19-estimates-5-days-for-incubation-period.html\n\nThe headline on this piece has been updated.

The law fast-tracks citizenship for migrants from three neighboring countries, specifically if they are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians. It conspicuously leaves out Muslims.\n\nSince the law was passed, it\u2019s drawn widespread opposition and protests, and not only because it discriminates against Muslims. The law is also closely linked to another controversial initiative: the National Registry of Citizens, a citizenship list that could potentially leave millions of people, primarily Muslims, stateless. \n\nSo far, only the northeastern state of Assam has implemented the NRC. In August 2019, the government of Assam published a citizenship list that left off nearly 2 million residents. And without the citizenship fast-track that the Citizenship Amendment Act grants to other religions, the Muslims left off that list are at risk of losing their citizenship entirely.\n\nTo understand the law, the national registry of citizens, the controversy they\u2019ve ignited, and what might happen next, we spoke with Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nFor more context on India\u2019s secular roots and its tense religious divide, watch our episode of Vox Borders India about the 1947 partition of India:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Ps1TZXAN8\n\nAnd for more recent context, you can watch another Vox Borders video about India\u2019s cow vigilantes and their attacks on Muslims in recent years:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_Iy1FoSn4&list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5eLwIHwp0NAPJaLSo9qNexm\n\nIf you want to dive deep into the law, here\u2019s both India\u2019s original 1955 Citizenship Act and the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act, which modifies the original law to provide a new path to citizenship based on religion:\nhttp://legislative.gov.in/actsofparliamentfromtheyear/citizenship-act-1955\nhttp://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2019/214646.pdf\n\nYou can also learn more about how documentation (birth certificates in particular) works in India and why millions are vulnerable to the new law:\nhttps://www.indiaspend.com/birth-certificates-are-citizenship-proof-govt-says-but-38-under-5-children-dont-have-one/\n\nAnd watch France 24\u2019s news coverage of the situation in Assam, including the detention camps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wviZkCqj3Is\n\nThe step-by-step fact-checking process of the verified viral videos of the mosque being vandalized in Delhi can be found here:\nhttps://www.altnews.in/verification-video-of-mosque-vandalised-set-on-fire-is-from-ashok-nagar-in-delhi/\n\nAnd here, for the police brutality video:\nhttps://www.altnews.in/video-verification-delhi-cops-beating-injured-men-forcing-them-to-sing-national-anthem/\n\nHere are some additional sources on the rise of Hindu nationalism in India under Modi\u2019s BJP party:\nhttps://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-religion-temple-factbox/factbox-what-does-indias-ruling-hindu-nationalist-party-want-to-achieve-idUSKBN1XL1PS\nhttps://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/india\n\nAnd finally, you can also read our latest articles covering the most notable developments of the unrest sparked by the Citizenship Amendment Act:\nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/17/20861427/india-assam-citizenship-muslim-detention-camps\nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/12/21010975/india-muslim-citizenship-bill-national-register\nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/16/21024306/india-protests-muslim-citizenship-amendment-bill\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2019/12/21/21033083/india-muslim-protests-citizenship-amendment-bill-cab-caa\n\nThanks for watching!

Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful \u2013a small minority.\u201d  This video explains how the people of China are themselves victims of the conditions that led to coronavirus. The virus is affecting many different countries and cultures, and there is never justification for xenophobia or racism.\n\nYou can find further reading on this on Vox:  \nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/2/7/21126758/coronavirus-xenophobia-racism-china-asians\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/4/21157825/coronavirus-pandemic-xenophobia-racism\nhttps://www.vox.com/identities/2020/3/6/21166625/coronavirus-photos-racism\n\nAs of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.\n\nBoth SARS and COVID-19 are in the \"coronavirus\" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge. \n\nFollow our reporting on coronavirus on vox.com: \nOur updated guide to Covid-19: http://bit.ly/3cGvqpU\n11 questions about the coronavirus outbreak, answered: http://bit.ly/3cHFSgT\nWhy washing your hands is so important: http://bit.ly/39vOaGy\n\nWatch our Netflix episode \"The next pandemic, explained\" https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062202\n\nFurther reading:\nPeter Li: https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3047828/first-sars-now-wuhan-coronavirus-heres-why-china-should-ban-its\nPeter Daszak, EcoAlliance: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html\nWildAid: https://wildaid.org/chinese-citizens-call-for-permanent-ban-on-wildlife-markets/\nOn the animal source: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w?fbclid=IwAR1TaU8leMGzeMUzV0uZVIOBskJC2Zh4P7hixJfBEvwnsouHZGZnF4QTz_A\n\nSupport Vox by joining the Video Lab at http://vox.com/join or making a one-time contribution here: http://vox.com/contribute\n\nNote: The headline has been updated.\nPrevious headline: Why new diseases keep appearing in China\n\nNote: A previous version of this video incorrectly colored Crimea as part of Russia on the map.

Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful \u2013a small minority.\u201d  This video explains how the people of China are themselves victims of the conditions that led to coronavirus. The virus is affecting many different countries and cultures, and there is never justification for xenophobia or racism.\n\nYou can find further reading on this on Vox:  \nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/2/7/21126758/coronavirus-xenophobia-racism-china-asians\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/4/21157825/coronavirus-pandemic-xenophobia-racism\nhttps://www.vox.com/identities/2020/3/6/21166625/coronavirus-photos-racism\n\nAs of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.\n\nBoth SARS and COVID-19 are in the \"coronavirus\" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge. \n\nFollow our reporting on coronavirus on vox.com: \nOur updated guide to Covid-19: http://bit.ly/3cGvqpU\n11 questions about the coronavirus outbreak, answered: http://bit.ly/3cHFSgT\nWhy washing your hands is so important: http://bit.ly/39vOaGy\n\nWatch our Netflix episode \"The next pandemic, explained\" https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062202\n\nFurther reading:\nPeter Li: https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3047828/first-sars-now-wuhan-coronavirus-heres-why-china-should-ban-its\nPeter Daszak, EcoAlliance: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html\nWildAid: https://wildaid.org/chinese-citizens-call-for-permanent-ban-on-wildlife-markets/\nOn the animal source: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w?fbclid=IwAR1TaU8leMGzeMUzV0uZVIOBskJC2Zh4P7hixJfBEvwnsouHZGZnF4QTz_A\n\nSupport Vox by joining the Video Lab at http://vox.com/join or making a one-time contribution here: http://vox.com/contribute\n\nNote: The headline has been updated.\nPrevious headline: Why new diseases keep appearing in China\n\nNote: A previous version of this video incorrectly colored Crimea as part of Russia on the map.

Before she became a US senator in 2012, she was a law professor. And in the early 2000s, she was driven by one question: Why, at a time when the economy seemed so good, were so many American families declaring bankruptcy?\n\nThe answers she found turned her into one of the country\u2019s fiercest advocates for consumers. They helped change how we think about the economy itself. And, Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein argues, it\u2019s Warren\u2019s understanding of America\u2019s big, systemic problems that makes her uniquely qualified to be the next president.\n\nSo: What exactly is it that Elizabeth Warren understands? What kind of president would she be?

Before she became a US senator in 2012, she was a law professor. And in the early 2000s, she was driven by one question: Why, at a time when the economy seemed so good, were so many American families declaring bankruptcy?\n\nThe answers she found turned her into one of the country\u2019s fiercest advocates for consumers. They helped change how we think about the economy itself. And, Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein argues, it\u2019s Warren\u2019s understanding of America\u2019s big, systemic problems that makes her uniquely qualified to be the next president.\n\nSo: What exactly is it that Elizabeth Warren understands? What kind of president would she be? And what does any of that tell us about how she would fare in a general election against Donald Trump?\n \nRead more about the case for Warren on Vox.com: http://bit.ly/2SgH2Xb\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\r\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/IZONyE\r\nOr our podcasts: https://www.vox.com/podcasts\r\n\r\nFollow Vox on Twitter: http://goo.gl/XFrZ5H\r\nOr on Facebook: http://goo.gl/U2g06o"

And at 38 years old, his age puts him in good company with many of the Democrats\u2019 recent successful nominees: Barack Obama, John F.

(Vox does not endorse individual candidates.)\n\nThe case for Bernie Sanders: https://youtu.be/1PjNlBV-_s8 \nThe case for Joe Biden: https://youtu.be/4c5fuOPCeYw\nThe case for Elizabeth Warren: https://youtu.be/VBpmYDLECF8\nThe case for Pete Buttigieg: https://youtu.be/0yT7hpF654k \n\nAnd you can read our cases for all the candidates, including Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, at http://vox.com/the-case-for\n\nUpdate: Pete Buttigieg withdrew his candidacy on March 1, 2020: https://www.vox.com/2020/3/1/21121523/pete-buttigieg-drops-out-2020-presidential-election\n\nIf he won the 2020 election, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg would become the youngest US president ever. And at 38 years old, his age puts him in good company with many of the Democrats\u2019 recent successful nominees: Barack Obama, John F. Kennedy, and Bill Clinton.\n\nBut as Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews argues, that\u2019s not Mayor Pete\u2019s only similarity with recent Democratic presidents. Like Obama and Clinton before him, Buttigieg has a way of describing traditionally liberal ideas, like expanded access to health care and higher taxes on the wealthy, in a way that appeals to voters who don\u2019t necessarily identify as liberals. \n\nSo: What kind of president would Pete Buttigieg be? What makes him different from the other candidates in the race? And what would his advantage be in a general election against Donald Trump? \n\nRead more about the case for Buttigieg on Vox.com: http://bit.ly/31qABF3\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/IZONyE\nOr our podcasts: https://www.vox.com/podcasts\n\nFollow Vox on Twitter: http://goo.gl/XFrZ5H\nOr on Facebook: http://goo.gl/U2g06o"

The devastating policies of his Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) \u2014 which forced millions of peasants to work tirelessly on government farming communes and by manufacturing crude steel \u2014 resulted in the greatest famine known to human history, costing anywhere between 23 and 55 million lives. \n\nMao wanted to leave behind a powerful Communist legacy, like Marx and Lenin before him. And in order to do so, he needed to connect with the younger generation before he died. So after announcing his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he swam across the Yangtze River. Mao had done the same swim 10 years earlier to prove his vitality, and he hoped it would work again.\n\nHis \"Cultural Revolution\" was a call to hunt down and eliminate his enemies, and reeducate China\u2019s youth with the principles Maoism. Led by the fanatical Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution was a devastating 10-year period in Chinese history that didn\u2019t end until Mao died in 1976.\n\nAdditional reading: \nEmbodying Maoism: The swimming craze, the Mao cult, and body politics in Communist China, 1950s\u20131970s, by Shuk-wah Poon \nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0026749X17000804\n\nRed-Color News Soldier, by Li Zhensheng\nhttp://red-colornewssoldier.com/\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

The devastating policies of his Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) \u2014 which forced millions of peasants to work tirelessly on government farming communes and by manufacturing crude steel \u2014 resulted in the greatest famine known to human history, costing anywhere between 23 and 55 million lives. \n\nMao wanted to leave behind a powerful Communist legacy, like Marx and Lenin before him. And in order to do so, he needed to connect with the younger generation before he died. So after announcing his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he swam across the Yangtze River. Mao had done the same swim 10 years earlier to prove his vitality, and he hoped it would work again.\n\nHis \"Cultural Revolution\" was a call to hunt down and eliminate his enemies, and reeducate China\u2019s youth with the principles Maoism. Led by the fanatical Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution was a devastating 10-year period in Chinese history that didn\u2019t end until Mao died in 1976.\n\nAdditional reading: \nEmbodying Maoism: The swimming craze, the Mao cult, and body politics in Communist China, 1950s\u20131970s, by Shuk-wah Poon \nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0026749X17000804\n\nRed-Color News Soldier, by Li Zhensheng\nhttp://red-colornewssoldier.com/\n\nDarkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

Each movie is a masterpiece of computer generated art, from the Avengers\u2019 time travel suits to Star Wars\u2019 chase scenes to the incredible de-aging effects in The Irishman.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be awed by these effects \u2014 or to not even notice them. So we brought in Niko Pueringer, a visual effects artist from the production studio Corridor Digital, to help us break down the visual magic behind each film. \n\nCheck out Niko and Corridor\u2019s YouTube channel for more visual effects breakdowns: https://www.youtube.com/user/samandniko/featured\n\nLike this one, where they re-made visual effects in The Mummy Returns: https://youtu.be/KH1V6CHO1Jk \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Each movie is a masterpiece of computer generated art, from the Avengers\u2019 time travel suits to Star Wars\u2019 chase scenes to the incredible de-aging effects in The Irishman.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be awed by these effects \u2014 or to not even notice them. So we brought in Niko Pueringer, a visual effects artist from the production studio Corridor Digital, to help us break down the visual magic behind each film. \n\nCheck out Niko and Corridor\u2019s YouTube channel for more visual effects breakdowns: https://www.youtube.com/user/samandniko/featured\n\nLike this one, where they re-made visual effects in The Mummy Returns: https://youtu.be/KH1V6CHO1Jk \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But Gazprom has also built a global profile as a soccer sponsor. Good publicity for Gazprom means good publicity for Russia; since Gazprom is owned by the Russian state, domestic approval for the foreign energy provider can help build a reputation for Russia in places that might otherwise be wary of their creeping influence. And as Vladimir Putin pursues that influence abroad, building relationships with foreign business leaders using the sport of soccer has proven extremely useful. \n\nOne place where that's been especially true is in Germany, where the team FC Schalke 04 has a longstanding sponsorship deal with Gazprom. When the deal was first signed in 2006, Russia was vying to increase their presence in the Western European gas market. Over a decade later, Gazprom sponsors one of Germany\u2019s most popular soccer teams, and is about to open their second major direct pipeline from Russia to Germany.\n\nA previous version of this video misidentified Switzerland on a map.

But Gazprom has also built a global profile as a soccer sponsor. Good publicity for Gazprom means good publicity for Russia; since Gazprom is owned by the Russian state, domestic approval for the foreign energy provider can help build a reputation for Russia in places that might otherwise be wary of their creeping influence. And as Vladimir Putin pursues that influence abroad, building relationships with foreign business leaders using the sport of soccer has proven extremely useful. \n\nOne place where that's been especially true is in Germany, where the team FC Schalke 04 has a longstanding sponsorship deal with Gazprom. When the deal was first signed in 2006, Russia was vying to increase their presence in the Western European gas market. Over a decade later, Gazprom sponsors one of Germany\u2019s most popular soccer teams, and is about to open their second major direct pipeline from Russia to Germany.\n\nA previous version of this video misidentified Switzerland on a map.

But there\u2019s a part of its story you won't see. \n\nIt\u2019s a story that goes back to the 1820s, when that part of New York was largely open countryside. Soon it became home to about 1,600 people. Among them was a predominantly black community that bought up affordable plots to build homes, churches and a school. It became known as Seneca Village. And when Irish and German immigrants moved in, it became a rare example at the time of an integrated neighborhood.\n\nEverything changed on July 21, 1853. New York took control of the land to create what would become the first major landscaped park in the US -- they called it \u201cThe Central Park.\u201d \n\nIn the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present.

Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy\n\nIf you\u2019ve been to New York, you\u2019ve probably visited Central Park. But there\u2019s a part of its story you won't see. \n\nIt\u2019s a story that goes back to the 1820s, when that part of New York was largely open countryside. Soon it became home to about 1,600 people. Among them was a predominantly black community that bought up affordable plots to build homes, churches and a school. It became known as Seneca Village. And when Irish and German immigrants moved in, it became a rare example at the time of an integrated neighborhood.\n\nEverything changed on July 21, 1853. New York took control of the land to create what would become the first major landscaped park in the US -- they called it \u201cThe Central Park.\u201d \n\nIn the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present.

Slow-moving and dependent on the forest, koalas have been especially hard hit with thousands dead in New South Wales alone. \n\nKoalas were already threatened before the Australia fires broke out. Decades of human activity has whittled their population down dramatically. But after this year\u2019s fire season, experts believe koalas are now in danger of becoming extinct \u2014 unless policy changes are put in place to save them. \n\nTo learn more, donate, or volunteer, check out these organizations: \n\nWIRES: https://www.wires.org.au/donate/emergency-fund\n\nWWF: https://www.wwf.org.au/get-involved/bushfire-emergency#gs.runjmb\n\nFauna Rescue: https://www.faunarescue.org.au/\n\nPort Macquarie Koala Hospital: https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-thirsty-koalas-devastated-by-recent-fires\n\nWildlife Victoria: https://www.wildlifevictoria.org.au/\n\nRSPCA New South Wales: https://www.rspcansw.org.au/bushfire-appeal/\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

He quickly acquired a monopoly \u2014 he owned one of the only lithography machines in Massachusetts outside of Boston \u2014 and it made him a wild success.\n\nBut in 1860, disaster struck. Bradley had printed thousands of portraits of Abraham Lincoln, hoping for strong sales based on Lincoln's presidential nomination. Unfortunately, Lincoln grew a beard in the meantime, and the portraits failed to sell, nearly bankrupting Bradley.\n\nFrom that failure, however, his greatest success was born. Soon thereafter, Bradley invented the Checkered Game of Life, with the game's board mirroring the ups and downs of his own career. It turned out to be a hit. In 1866, Bradley patented the game and secured his fortune.\n\nAfter Milton Bradley died in 1911, the game of Life began to transform from board-game-as-moral-tract to board-game-as-escape. The version familiar to modern players makes success all about money and achievement rather than virtue. \n\nThat makes a couple of questions surprisingly tricky to answer: What should the meaning of Life be? And which version of the game is actually more depressing?\n\nWant to learn more?

But there\u2019s a better way to power the world.\n\nA microgrid is a decentralized power system that doesn\u2019t have a single point of failure. That means one squirrel can\u2019t cause a massive blackout, and it also protects against the increasing number of severe weather events, storms, and wildfires.\n\nRead more on the power of microgrids in David Roberts\u2019 and Alvin Chang\u2019s explainer on the topic: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/15/16714146/greener-more-reliable-more-resilient-grid-microgrids\n\nMore on how California can become more energy-resilient: \nhttps://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/15/16714146/greener-more-reliable-more-resilient-grid-microgrids\n\nUmair Irfan\u2019s reporting on PG&E\u2019s power shutoffs in California: \nhttps://www.vox.com/2019/10/9/20906551/pge-power-shutdown-blackout-fire-bankruptcy\n\nFor data on squirrel-related power outages, check out this map that shows all animal-related outages: https://cybersquirrel1.com/\n\nNote: The headline on this video has been updated.\nPrevious version: How to squirrel-proof the power grid\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

And if you look at a chart of how much every American pays in income taxes, that seems basically true. But income taxes are just one type of the many taxes we pay. So what happens if we add them all up? A new analysis by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman did exactly that. And it shows that the American tax system might not be as \"progressive\" as many people believe.\n\nRead more about that analysis in an op-ed Saez and Zucman wrote for the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/opinion/sunday/wealth-income-tax-rate.html\n\nAll of their data, which we used to produce this video, is available on their website: https://taxjusticenow.org/\n\nTheir full research is presented in their book, the Triumph of Injustice: https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Injustice-Rich-Dodge-Taxes/dp/1324002727\n\nAnd if you want to watch a bunch of economists debate this research (economists got very fired up about this!), watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUGpjpEGTfE\n\nBut if you don't want to watch this long debate, Vox's Matt Yglesias explains what it's all about: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/4/20938229/zucman-saez-tax-rates-top-400 \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "There's a common myth about who pays their fair share, and who doesn't.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nYou might have heard that the poor in America barely pay any taxes. And if you look at a chart of how much every American pays in income taxes, that seems basically true. But income taxes are just one type of the many taxes we pay. So what happens if we add them all up? A new analysis by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman did exactly that. And it shows that the American tax system might not be as \"progressive\" as many people believe.\n\nRead more about that analysis in an op-ed Saez and Zucman wrote for the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/opinion/sunday/wealth-income-tax-rate.html\n\nAll of their data, which we used to produce this video, is available on their website: https://taxjusticenow.org/\n\nTheir full research is presented in their book, the Triumph of Injustice: https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Injustice-Rich-Dodge-Taxes/dp/1324002727\n\nAnd if you want to watch a bunch of economists debate this research (economists got very fired up about this!), watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUGpjpEGTfE\n\nBut if you don't want to watch this long debate, Vox's Matt Yglesias explains what it's all about: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/4/20938229/zucman-saez-tax-rates-top-400 \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Today, animators still use techniques like rotoscoping to turn real movement into animation.\n\nCheck out the original patent!\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US1242674A/en\n\nIf you want to learn more about early animation, check out Fleischer Studios on the web and YouTube.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCAhYwGZxcAPDpu5Q7ueKQ\n\nYou can also read Man and Superman: The Fleischer Studio Negotiates the Real in Quarterly Review of Film and Video by J.P. Telotte, which describes the techniques used for the animated Superman series.\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10509200802433020\n\nThe Fleischer Story by Leslie Cabarga is invaluable for any early animation fan and has lots of trivia you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Fleischer-Story-Leslie-Cabarga/dp/0306803135\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                "description": "Whistleblowers who work with classified information have a few options. All of them are bad.\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\n\u201cWhistleblowing\u201d is when someone exposes a secret in their organization. And in the US, it\u2019s often hailed as a heroic act. But within the government, whistleblowing is often perilous\u2014especially when it involves classified information.\n\nIf a whistleblower goes to the media with classified information, that\u2019s illegal. And since the Obama administration, it\u2019s become common for the government to prosecute people who do it by charging them under a law from 1917 that was originally intended to prosecute spies for helping foreign governments. If a whistleblower files a complaint through internal channels instead, the complaint has to go through the head of the intelligence community before it can see the light of day\u2014and after that, there are few protections against disclosing the whistleblower\u2019s identity, and only weak recourses against retaliation. \n\nIn August 2019, a CIA officer filed a complaint about an alleged quid pro quo between President Trump and the President of Ukraine. The complaint made it to Congress, and kicked off impeachment proceedings. But the existing laws don\u2019t guarantee that this whistleblower will be protected, either.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

All of them are bad.\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\n\u201cWhistleblowing\u201d is when someone exposes a secret in their organization. And in the US, it\u2019s often hailed as a heroic act. But within the government, whistleblowing is often perilous\u2014especially when it involves classified information.\n\nIf a whistleblower goes to the media with classified information, that\u2019s illegal. And since the Obama administration, it\u2019s become common for the government to prosecute people who do it by charging them under a law from 1917 that was originally intended to prosecute spies for helping foreign governments. If a whistleblower files a complaint through internal channels instead, the complaint has to go through the head of the intelligence community before it can see the light of day\u2014and after that, there are few protections against disclosing the whistleblower\u2019s identity, and only weak recourses against retaliation. \n\nIn August 2019, a CIA officer filed a complaint about an alleged quid pro quo between President Trump and the President of Ukraine. The complaint made it to Congress, and kicked off impeachment proceedings. But the existing laws don\u2019t guarantee that this whistleblower will be protected, either.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy\n\nStarting in the 1950s, a Florida state committee spent years stalking, intimidating, and outing hundreds of LGBTQ people. And they got away with it. Amid a national witch hunt for communists and an ascendant civil rights movement, a group of Florida politicians with a mission to preserve racial segregation in the state created a powerful group called the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee.\n\nCommonly called the \"Johns Committee\" for the influential state senator Charley Johns who spearheaded it, the Committee went after civil rights activists by arguing they were backed by communists. But when those investigations failed, they turned to a new group to target: LGBTQ people. Today, over 50 years later, some Florida legislators are calling for the state to finally come to terms with this part of its history.\n\nNote: The headline on this piece has been updated.\nPrevious headline: When Florida had a committee to terrorize gay people\n\nIn the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present.

Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy\n\nStarting in the 1950s, a Florida state committee spent years stalking, intimidating, and outing hundreds of LGBTQ people. And they got away with it. Amid a national witch hunt for communists and an ascendant civil rights movement, a group of Florida politicians with a mission to preserve racial segregation in the state created a powerful group called the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee.\n\nCommonly called the \"Johns Committee\" for the influential state senator Charley Johns who spearheaded it, the Committee went after civil rights activists by arguing they were backed by communists. But when those investigations failed, they turned to a new group to target: LGBTQ people. Today, over 50 years later, some Florida legislators are calling for the state to finally come to terms with this part of its history.\n\nNote: The headline on this piece has been updated.\nPrevious headline: When Florida had a committee to terrorize gay people\n\nIn the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present.

At some point in the last decade, they became the secret ingredient for advertising, political messaging, and disinformation all across the world. Glad You Asked host Christophe Haubursin wanted to know why that happened \u2014 and what it means for the internet today.\n\nKey Sources:\nThe Ambivalent Internet: Mischief, Oddity, and Antagonism Online \nhttps://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Ambivalent+Internet%3A+Mischief%2C+Oddity%2C+and+Antagonism+Online-p-9781509501274\nFor this video, we spoke to Ryan Milner and Whitney Phillips, the co-authors of this book on the messy, antagonistic folklore constantly being created through memes. \n\nThe Disinformation Report https://www.newknowledge.com/articles/the-disinformation-report/ This is the senate-commissioned report on Russian election influence that identifies memes as the \u201cpropaganda of the digital age.\u201d \n\nMemes in Digital Culture\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2516602618806389\nIf you\u2019re curious to read more about the academic study of internet memetics, Limor Shifman\u2019s work is a great place to start. \n\nIt\u2019s Supposed to Look Like Shit: The Internet Ugly Aesthetic https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1470412914544516\nThe term \u201cinternet ugly\u201d comes from this paper by Nick Douglas.

This 21 mile-wide passage supports 20% of the world\u2019s oil supply. A closure of this waterway could send the global economy into a tailspin. \n\nIn recent months, several oil tankers have been seized, attacked and harassed. These oil tankers \u2014\u00a0and this narrow water passage \u2014 are at the center of the conflict between the US and Iran. It's a conflict that spans decades and has the potential to escalate in one of the world\u2019s most important oil chokepoints.\n\nRead more about the recent escalation between the US and Iran:\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/21/18700857/us-iran-standoff-timeline\n\nStrait of Hormuz stats and details from the US Energy Information Administration:\nhttps://www.eia.gov/beta/international/regions-topics.php?RegionTopicID=WOTC\n\nMore on the history of conflict between the US and Iran in the Strait of Hormuz in David Crist's novel, The Twilight War: \nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307277/the-twilight-war-by-david-crist/9780143123675/\n\nVox Atlas demonstrates where conflicts occur on a map and the ways in which foreign policy shapes a region.

This 21 mile-wide passage supports 20% of the world\u2019s oil supply. A closure of this waterway could send the global economy into a tailspin. \n\nIn recent months, several oil tankers have been seized, attacked and harassed. These oil tankers \u2014\u00a0and this narrow water passage \u2014 are at the center of the conflict between the US and Iran. It's a conflict that spans decades and has the potential to escalate in one of the world\u2019s most important oil chokepoints.\n\nRead more about the recent escalation between the US and Iran:\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/21/18700857/us-iran-standoff-timeline\n\nStrait of Hormuz stats and details from the US Energy Information Administration:\nhttps://www.eia.gov/beta/international/regions-topics.php?RegionTopicID=WOTC\n\nMore on the history of conflict between the US and Iran in the Strait of Hormuz in David Crist's novel, The Twilight War: \nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307277/the-twilight-war-by-david-crist/9780143123675/\n\nVox Atlas demonstrates where conflicts occur on a map and the ways in which foreign policy shapes a region.

Learn more at http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nRoute 66 has gained a reputation as the United States of America\u2019s most famous road. How did that happen, and why does it still matter?\n\nIn this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox\u2019s Phil Edwards explores the history of the road and the textures of its present, from the road itself to the roadside attractions along the way, to the people who enjoy its diversions and those who help maintain them. It reveals a road that\u2019s changed a lot over the decades but remains vital in unexpected ways.\n\nWhen Cyrus Avery helped found Route 66 in the 1920s, he strived to create a road that would connect the Midwest to the West, and he resorted to promotional tricks and wheeling and dealing to get it done. The road quickly became a key route for migrants escaping the dust bowl and depression, forming its early reputation as \u201cthe Mother Road.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a road that\u2019s more than a strip of concrete (or gravel, or dirt). It\u2019s a historical document of everyone who\u2019s traveled on it \u2014 as the many contributions from Vox\u2019s YouTube subscribers show, that keeps it going even as the interstates run alongside it.\n\nThe number of Route 66 resources out there is huge, but we found these particularly helpful.\n\nCheck out Ron's site! \nhttps://www.route66news.com/\n\nThe Curt Teich Archives\nhttps://www.newberry.org/curt-teich-p...\nYou won't find essays here, but you will find a treasure trove of postcards that we used in this piece, including tons of Route 66 arcana.\n\nRoute 66: The Highway and Its People\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080...\nI got to speak with Quinta Scott about her gorgeous photographs of Route 66, as well as the interviews she recorded with coauthor Susan Kelly. This book is a pleasure to look at and is packed full of information and interviews that you just can\u2019t get any more.\n\nThe Route 66 Road Ahead Partnership\nhttp://route66roadahead.com/\nIf you\u2019re curious about Route 66 preservation and revitalization, this group is one of the strongest interstate partnerships searching for new ways to promote and improve the road.\n\nOur video about the Green Book, a critical resource for black Americans wanting to travel across the country on Route 66 and beyond in the mid-1900s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b33PN2NB2Do \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Learn more at http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nRoute 66 has gained a reputation as the United States of America\u2019s most famous road. How did that happen, and why does it still matter?\n\nIn this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox\u2019s Phil Edwards explores the history of the road and the textures of its present, from the road itself to the roadside attractions along the way, to the people who enjoy its diversions and those who help maintain them. It reveals a road that\u2019s changed a lot over the decades but remains vital in unexpected ways.\n\nWhen Cyrus Avery helped found Route 66 in the 1920s, he strived to create a road that would connect the Midwest to the West, and he resorted to promotional tricks and wheeling and dealing to get it done. The road quickly became a key route for migrants escaping the dust bowl and depression, forming its early reputation as \u201cthe Mother Road.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a road that\u2019s more than a strip of concrete (or gravel, or dirt). It\u2019s a historical document of everyone who\u2019s traveled on it \u2014 as the many contributions from Vox\u2019s YouTube subscribers show, that keeps it going even as the interstates run alongside it.\n\nThe number of Route 66 resources out there is huge, but we found these particularly helpful.\n\nCheck out Ron's site! \nhttps://www.route66news.com/\n\nThe Curt Teich Archives\nhttps://www.newberry.org/curt-teich-p...\nYou won't find essays here, but you will find a treasure trove of postcards that we used in this piece, including tons of Route 66 arcana.\n\nRoute 66: The Highway and Its People\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080...\nI got to speak with Quinta Scott about her gorgeous photographs of Route 66, as well as the interviews she recorded with coauthor Susan Kelly. This book is a pleasure to look at and is packed full of information and interviews that you just can\u2019t get any more.\n\nThe Route 66 Road Ahead Partnership\nhttp://route66roadahead.com/\nIf you\u2019re curious about Route 66 preservation and revitalization, this group is one of the strongest interstate partnerships searching for new ways to promote and improve the road.\n\nOur video about the Green Book, a critical resource for black Americans wanting to travel across the country on Route 66 and beyond in the mid-1900s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b33PN2NB2Do \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It\u2019s not an accident. In fact, this appearance of the suburbs is part of the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s plan.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, was the financial engine behind most home development. To ensure their investments were safe ones, they strongly recommended that builders and developers comply with the ideals they set.

It\u2019s not an accident. In fact, this appearance of the suburbs is part of the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s plan.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, was the financial engine behind most home development. To ensure their investments were safe ones, they strongly recommended that builders and developers comply with the ideals they set. Those regulations aligned closely with the values of the time, including segregation and a burgeoning car culture.\n\nThese rules encouraged suburbs with winding streets and cul de sacs \u2014 aesthetically pleasing designs that led to sprawl and made a car a necessity. Even though the enforcement mechanisms have changed over time, we still live in a culture shaped by the FHA\u2019s ideal suburban design.\n\nIf you want to learn more, there are a couple of resources:\n\nStreets and the Shaping of Towns and Cities by Michael Southworth and Eran Ben-Joseph\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Streets-Shaping-Cities-Michael-Southworth/dp/1559639164\nEran Ben-Joseph spoke to me about his book, which provides a great overview of suburban planning.

That\u2019s where things get complicated. His incredible feats of bear-killing and frontier exploring intersected with a political career that was catalyzed by central banking.\n\nWhen Crockett was alive, Andrew Jackson was president, and Jackson was embroiled in a battle over the Second Bank of the United States. That battle eventually resulted in the creation of a new political party \u2014 the Whigs \u2014 and the Whigs decided Crockett could help advance their cause.\n\nIn a strange way, it\u2019s possible to trace the American icon and baby boomer fad back to this banking battle.

This article offers a fairly compelling comparison of the two: \nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.660.5241&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\nFinally, this video offered a simplified explanation of a really complex weather phenomenon. This National Geographic article does a really great job breaking it down again and also offers information on why it\u2019s so hard to track and predict tornadoes:\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150511-tornadoes-storms-midwest-weather-science/\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But after a decades long civil war, fishermen returned to find their fish stocks depleted \u2013 and they pointed the finger squarely at neighboring India.\u00a0\n\nAs Indian fishermen developed methods to increase hauls, and crossed a maritime border that was more permeable during the war, they depleted the fish stock for both sides.\u00a0\n\nNow, the Sri Lankan Navy is retaliating with force, only making the relationship between the two communities that rely on these waters worse.\u00a0\n\nThis Vox Borders episode will look at how the drawing of a maritime border and lack of access to fish caused a conflict between two communities that used to live in harmony. \n\nWatch the first episode of Vox Borders: India -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Ps1TZXAN8\n\nWatch all the episodes of Vox Borders: India here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5eLwIHwp0NAPJaLSo9qNexm\n\nVox Borders is an international documentary series by Emmy-nominated producer Johnny Harris exploring life at the edge of nations. \n\nStart from the beginning.

But after a decades long civil war, fishermen returned to find their fish stocks depleted \u2013 and they pointed the finger squarely at neighboring India.\u00a0\n\nAs Indian fishermen developed methods to increase hauls, and crossed a maritime border that was more permeable during the war, they depleted the fish stock for both sides.\u00a0\n\nNow, the Sri Lankan Navy is retaliating with force, only making the relationship between the two communities that rely on these waters worse.\u00a0\n\nThis Vox Borders episode will look at how the drawing of a maritime border and lack of access to fish caused a conflict between two communities that used to live in harmony. \n\nWatch the first episode of Vox Borders: India -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Ps1TZXAN8\n\nWatch all the episodes of Vox Borders: India here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5eLwIHwp0NAPJaLSo9qNexm\n\nVox Borders is an international documentary series by Emmy-nominated producer Johnny Harris exploring life at the edge of nations. \n\nStart from the beginning.

Both begin in Turkey and make their way down the entire length of the country, before emptying into the Persian Gulf. The problem is - they are drying up.\n\nThere are two main reasons for this. The first is geographical: Since both rivers begin in Turkey, Iraq doesn\u2019t have control of how much water it receives. In the last 30 years, Turkey, Syria, and Iran have been building hundreds of dams along both rivers. Now only a quarter of the Euphrates reaches Iraq. Secondly, Iraq has been stuck in conflict for the last 16 years. In each case, the delicate network of treatment plants, dams, canals, and pipes has been repeatedly destroyed and neglected.\n\nAll of this has boiled over in the city of Basra - at Iraq\u2019s southern tip. Last summer, after hundreds were poisoned by the water - riots erupted and were deeply destabilizing for the new Iraqi government. If Iraq is to rebuild, it needs to get fresh water to its people - a challenge that is getting harder every year.\n\nThrough Vox Atlas, producer Sam Ellis demonstrates where conflicts occur on a map and the ways in which foreign policy shapes a region.

They worked all over the country in cotton mills, glass blowing factories, sardine canneries, farms, and even coal mines. In an effort to expose this exploitation of children, the National Child Labor Committee hired a photographer to travel around the country and investigate and report on the labor conditions of children. \n\nLewis Wickes Hine photographed and interviewed kids, some as young as 4 years old, and published his findings in various Progressive magazines and newspapers. Once the public saw the plight of these children, state legislatures were pressured to pass bills regulating labor for workers under the age of 18, effectively bringing an end to child labor in the United States. \n\nSee the entire collection of Lewis Hine's photos for the National Child Labor Committee here: https://www.loc.gov/collections/national-child-labor-committee/about-this-collection/\n\nDarkroom is a series from Vox producer Coleman Lowndes that digs into stories of the past, one photograph at a time.

They worked all over the country in cotton mills, glass blowing factories, sardine canneries, farms, and even coal mines. In an effort to expose this exploitation of children, the National Child Labor Committee hired a photographer to travel around the country and investigate and report on the labor conditions of children. \n\nLewis Wickes Hine photographed and interviewed kids, some as young as 4 years old, and published his findings in various Progressive magazines and newspapers. Once the public saw the plight of these children, state legislatures were pressured to pass bills regulating labor for workers under the age of 18, effectively bringing an end to child labor in the United States. \n\nSee the entire collection of Lewis Hine's photos for the National Child Labor Committee here: https://www.loc.gov/collections/national-child-labor-committee/about-this-collection/\n\nDarkroom is a series from Vox producer Coleman Lowndes that digs into stories of the past, one photograph at a time.

                "description": "The people of Hong Kong are protesting in record-breaking numbers. \n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nCorrection at 7:48: The protester says \u201cThey are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China\u2019s flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city\u2019s judicial independence.\n\nAt first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill. But after a series of massive protests, she announced she would \u201cindefinitely suspend\u201d the bill. But protesters aren't accepting the suspension, and have started demanding its complete withdrawal. They've also begun calling for Lam\u2019s resignation.\n\nBut this rise in tensions is about a lot more than a bill. To understand why this bill hits a nerve with Hongkongers, it's important to understand Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with China - and exactly how the bill would tip the scales in China\u2019s favor.\n\nWatch this video to understand the news coming out of Hong Kong and the history that led up to this moment.\u00a0\n\nFor more watch Episode one of our Vox Borders Hong Kong episodes here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyxG4vTyZ8\n\nAnd for even more context on Hong Kong\u2019s history with Britain you can watch another one of our Vox Borders Hong Kong episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StW7oGSR_Mg\n\nIf you want to get real nerdy you can read Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law (their mini Constitution) here:\nhttps://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/index.html\n\nYou can also read the Sino-British Joint Declaration that defined Hong Kong when the British handed it back to China in 1997 here: http://www.gov.cn/english/2007-06/14/content_649468.htm\n\nAnd the extradition law introduced in Hong Kong that has sparked massive protests here:\nhttps://www.legco.gov.hk/yr18-19/english/hc/papers/hc20190412ls-65-e.pdf\n\nHere is a piece reported by the New York Times on the latest from Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/asia/hong-kong-carrie-lam-extradition.html\n\nHere are some additional resources regarding Hong Kong\u2019s democracy and political make-up:\nhttps://sites.duke.edu/corporations/2018/01/29/the-mirror-colonial-britain-and-chinas-rationale-for-hong-kongs-functional-constituency/\nhttps://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/democracy-hong-kong\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=ZDubDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=Reunification,+Patriotism,+and+Political+Disorder:+From+1997+to+2017+%22underground+front%22&source=bl&ots=vn4zdV2FSi&sig=ACfU3U2yyYBTZ0hFfWC6y9oYS4YzxY6UDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVgcDv5eziAhXQg-AKHV4EB9sQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nAnd finally, you can also find our latest articles covering the most recent developments here:\nhttps://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18683582/hong-kong-extradition-bill-protests-china\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/16/18680897/huge-hong-kong-protests-continue-after-the-government-postpones-controversial-billhttps://www.vox.com/2019/6/11/18661007/hong-kong-protest-2019-china-extradition\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/9/18658650/hong-kong-protest-march-china-extradition-bill-2019\n\nThanks for watching!

                    "description": "The people of Hong Kong are protesting in record-breaking numbers. \n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nCorrection at 7:48: The protester says \u201cThey are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China\u2019s flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city\u2019s judicial independence.\n\nAt first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill. But after a series of massive protests, she announced she would \u201cindefinitely suspend\u201d the bill. But protesters aren't accepting the suspension, and have started demanding its complete withdrawal. They've also begun calling for Lam\u2019s resignation.\n\nBut this rise in tensions is about a lot more than a bill. To understand why this bill hits a nerve with Hongkongers, it's important to understand Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with China - and exactly how the bill would tip the scales in China\u2019s favor.\n\nWatch this video to understand the news coming out of Hong Kong and the history that led up to this moment.\u00a0\n\nFor more watch Episode one of our Vox Borders Hong Kong episodes here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyxG4vTyZ8\n\nAnd for even more context on Hong Kong\u2019s history with Britain you can watch another one of our Vox Borders Hong Kong episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StW7oGSR_Mg\n\nIf you want to get real nerdy you can read Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law (their mini Constitution) here:\nhttps://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/index.html\n\nYou can also read the Sino-British Joint Declaration that defined Hong Kong when the British handed it back to China in 1997 here: http://www.gov.cn/english/2007-06/14/content_649468.htm\n\nAnd the extradition law introduced in Hong Kong that has sparked massive protests here:\nhttps://www.legco.gov.hk/yr18-19/english/hc/papers/hc20190412ls-65-e.pdf\n\nHere is a piece reported by the New York Times on the latest from Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/asia/hong-kong-carrie-lam-extradition.html\n\nHere are some additional resources regarding Hong Kong\u2019s democracy and political make-up:\nhttps://sites.duke.edu/corporations/2018/01/29/the-mirror-colonial-britain-and-chinas-rationale-for-hong-kongs-functional-constituency/\nhttps://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/democracy-hong-kong\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=ZDubDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=Reunification,+Patriotism,+and+Political+Disorder:+From+1997+to+2017+%22underground+front%22&source=bl&ots=vn4zdV2FSi&sig=ACfU3U2yyYBTZ0hFfWC6y9oYS4YzxY6UDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVgcDv5eziAhXQg-AKHV4EB9sQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nAnd finally, you can also find our latest articles covering the most recent developments here:\nhttps://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18683582/hong-kong-extradition-bill-protests-china\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/16/18680897/huge-hong-kong-protests-continue-after-the-government-postpones-controversial-billhttps://www.vox.com/2019/6/11/18661007/hong-kong-protest-2019-china-extradition\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/9/18658650/hong-kong-protest-march-china-extradition-bill-2019\n\nThanks for watching!

This video is presented by Skillshare. \nClick here to get your first two months of Skillshare for free: https://skl.sh/vox2\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nSansa Stark and Cersei Lannister are two of Game of Thrones\u2019 most recognizable enemies. But despite being on opposite sides of Westeros, their costumes have a ton in common.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the show, their outfits have been mirrors. When they\u2019re both oppressed and weak in the earlier seasons, they\u2019re dressed in loose, pastel clothing signaling their lack of power. As the show moves on and their plots become more complicated, they don \u201csurvival camouflage,\u201d clothes used to mask secrets and blend in with enemies. And when both women begin to assert the power of their houses, Lannister lions and Stark wolves become the focal point of their clothes.\n\nIn the show\u2019s final season, Sansa and Cersei default to military-style accents on their gowns as they prep for battle. Those high-necked dresses evoke images of each family\u2019s armor \u2014 full of defensive details like epaulets and draped chains. And while both leaders have learned different lessons about war and family, it\u2019s safe to say their outfit parallels are there for a reason.\n\nRead more about the costumes of these powerful women on vox.com:\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/19/18484819/game-of-thrones-daenerys-targaryen-costumes-michele-clapton\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/9/18300675/game-of-thrones-cersei-lannister-costumes-michele-clapton\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/3/18287327/game-of-thrones-sansa-stark-costumes-michele-clapton\n\nNote: The headline for this video has been updated since publishing.\nPrevious headline: How Game of Thrones uses costume design to show power\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what\u2019s really driving the events in the headlines.

This video is presented by Skillshare. \nClick here to get your first two months of Skillshare for free: https://skl.sh/vox2\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nSansa Stark and Cersei Lannister are two of Game of Thrones\u2019 most recognizable enemies. But despite being on opposite sides of Westeros, their costumes have a ton in common.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the show, their outfits have been mirrors. When they\u2019re both oppressed and weak in the earlier seasons, they\u2019re dressed in loose, pastel clothing signaling their lack of power. As the show moves on and their plots become more complicated, they don \u201csurvival camouflage,\u201d clothes used to mask secrets and blend in with enemies. And when both women begin to assert the power of their houses, Lannister lions and Stark wolves become the focal point of their clothes.\n\nIn the show\u2019s final season, Sansa and Cersei default to military-style accents on their gowns as they prep for battle. Those high-necked dresses evoke images of each family\u2019s armor \u2014 full of defensive details like epaulets and draped chains. And while both leaders have learned different lessons about war and family, it\u2019s safe to say their outfit parallels are there for a reason.\n\nRead more about the costumes of these powerful women on vox.com:\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/19/18484819/game-of-thrones-daenerys-targaryen-costumes-michele-clapton\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/9/18300675/game-of-thrones-cersei-lannister-costumes-michele-clapton\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/3/18287327/game-of-thrones-sansa-stark-costumes-michele-clapton\n\nNote: The headline for this video has been updated since publishing.\nPrevious headline: How Game of Thrones uses costume design to show power\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what\u2019s really driving the events in the headlines.

                "description": "Heavy metal and Satan played a role in the introduction of the explicit lyrics sticker.\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nThe explicit lyrics sticker is one of the most recognizable images in American music. Its placement on an album cover signifies you\u2019re going to hear something for adult ears only, and it\u2019s an image we often take for granted. The story behind how we got that sticker is bonkers, to say the least. \n\nThe very public discussion around the advisory label involved the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), a group led by the wives of Washington politicians and a few musicians including Frank Zappa, Dee Snider, and John Denver.\n\nWhile the PMRC\u2019s involvement was allegedly sparked by some raunchy lyrics from Prince\u2019s 1984 album Purple Rain, the debate over rock lyrics had been infiltrating American culture and politics for a decade. The driving force behind that debate was the rise of heavy metal, a genre that saw explosive popularity with the launch of MTV in 1981, and the growing influence of the religious right, who saw rock music as a powerful threat to Christianity. \n\nFollow Vox Earworm on Facebook for more: http://www.facebook.com/VoxEarworm\n\nAnd be sure to check out Earworm's complete first season here: http://bit.ly/2QCwhMH\n\nSome songs don't just stick in your head, they change the music world forever.

                    "description": "Heavy metal and Satan played a role in the introduction of the explicit lyrics sticker.\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nThe explicit lyrics sticker is one of the most recognizable images in American music. Its placement on an album cover signifies you\u2019re going to hear something for adult ears only, and it\u2019s an image we often take for granted. The story behind how we got that sticker is bonkers, to say the least. \n\nThe very public discussion around the advisory label involved the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), a group led by the wives of Washington politicians and a few musicians including Frank Zappa, Dee Snider, and John Denver.\n\nWhile the PMRC\u2019s involvement was allegedly sparked by some raunchy lyrics from Prince\u2019s 1984 album Purple Rain, the debate over rock lyrics had been infiltrating American culture and politics for a decade. The driving force behind that debate was the rise of heavy metal, a genre that saw explosive popularity with the launch of MTV in 1981, and the growing influence of the religious right, who saw rock music as a powerful threat to Christianity. \n\nFollow Vox Earworm on Facebook for more: http://www.facebook.com/VoxEarworm\n\nAnd be sure to check out Earworm's complete first season here: http://bit.ly/2QCwhMH\n\nSome songs don't just stick in your head, they change the music world forever.

Ever since Britain left India in 1947 and hastily drew borders demarcating a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan, Kashmir, located right between the two, has been fervently claimed by both nations.  \n\nIndia and Pakistan\u2019s first war was fought over Kashmir\u2019s status as the the newly independent countries were being formed. After over a year of bloody conflict the UN stepped in and brokered a ceasefire that drew a line down the middle of Kashmir and gave a portion of the territory to India and the remainder to Pakistan. This arrangement was meant to be temporary. Once the violence settled a vote was to be held that would allow Kashmiris to decide their own future. \n\nBut more than 70 years later, Kashmiris have yet to vote on their status. They remain stuck between two nuclear nations locked in a dangerous conflict with no end in sight. \n\nAdditional reading and sources on the conflict:\n\n[BBC Timeline]\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-16069078\n\n[UN report \u2014 Human Rights in Kashmir] https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/IN/DevelopmentsInKashmirJune2016ToApril2018.pdf\n\n[CFR Conflict Tracker]\nhttps://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan\n\n[Freedom House Report]\nhttps://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/indian-kashmir\n\nSpecial thanks to Kashmiris who shared their opinions with us:\n\nAqib Salam\nAarif Shah\nAijaz Ganaie\nInjilla Sidiq \nSadaf Zehra\nMian Tufail\nMehak Dhaar\nRehan\nRihana Maqbool\nWaqas Khan\nSajid Yousuf\nTariq Bashir\n\nThrough Vox Atlas, producer Sam Ellis demonstrates where conflicts occur on a map and the ways in which foreign policy shapes a region.

Ever since Britain left India in 1947 and hastily drew borders demarcating a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan, Kashmir, located right between the two, has been fervently claimed by both nations.  \n\nIndia and Pakistan\u2019s first war was fought over Kashmir\u2019s status as the the newly independent countries were being formed. After over a year of bloody conflict the UN stepped in and brokered a ceasefire that drew a line down the middle of Kashmir and gave a portion of the territory to India and the remainder to Pakistan. This arrangement was meant to be temporary. Once the violence settled a vote was to be held that would allow Kashmiris to decide their own future. \n\nBut more than 70 years later, Kashmiris have yet to vote on their status. They remain stuck between two nuclear nations locked in a dangerous conflict with no end in sight. \n\nAdditional reading and sources on the conflict:\n\n[BBC Timeline]\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-16069078\n\n[UN report \u2014 Human Rights in Kashmir] https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/IN/DevelopmentsInKashmirJune2016ToApril2018.pdf\n\n[CFR Conflict Tracker]\nhttps://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan\n\n[Freedom House Report]\nhttps://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/indian-kashmir\n\nSpecial thanks to Kashmiris who shared their opinions with us:\n\nAqib Salam\nAarif Shah\nAijaz Ganaie\nInjilla Sidiq \nSadaf Zehra\nMian Tufail\nMehak Dhaar\nRehan\nRihana Maqbool\nWaqas Khan\nSajid Yousuf\nTariq Bashir\n\nThrough Vox Atlas, producer Sam Ellis demonstrates where conflicts occur on a map and the ways in which foreign policy shapes a region.

Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy\n\n100 years ago, a white mob destroyed an American neighborhood called \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d murdering an estimated 300 people in Tulsa, Oklahoma. That incident \u2014 known as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre \u2014 has been largely left out of US history books. Today, a century later, the city still has a lot of questions. For one, where are the bodies of the victims? As the city's mayor re-opens the search for mass graves, we take a look at what happened back in 1921\u2026and why finding these graves still matters to the people of Tulsa. \n\nFor more reading, check out the links below: \n\nVox\u2019s reporting on an eyewitness account of the horrific attack: https://www.vox.com/2016/6/1/11827994/tulsa-race-massacre-black-wall-street\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s in-depth story on the massacre and the current challenges of gentrification: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/09/28/feature/they-was-killing-black-people/\n\nAnd to take a look through more digitized photos, audio, and documents from 1921, check out the Tulsa Historical Society\u2019s collection: https://www.tulsahistory.org/exhibit/1921-tulsa-race-massacre/\n\nSign up for the Missing Chapter newsletter to stay up to date with the series:  https://vox.com/missing-chapter\n\nHave an idea for a story that Ranjani should investigate for Missing Chapter?

Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy\n\n100 years ago, a white mob destroyed an American neighborhood called \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d murdering an estimated 300 people in Tulsa, Oklahoma. That incident \u2014 known as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre \u2014 has been largely left out of US history books. Today, a century later, the city still has a lot of questions. For one, where are the bodies of the victims? As the city's mayor re-opens the search for mass graves, we take a look at what happened back in 1921\u2026and why finding these graves still matters to the people of Tulsa. \n\nFor more reading, check out the links below: \n\nVox\u2019s reporting on an eyewitness account of the horrific attack: https://www.vox.com/2016/6/1/11827994/tulsa-race-massacre-black-wall-street\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s in-depth story on the massacre and the current challenges of gentrification: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/09/28/feature/they-was-killing-black-people/\n\nAnd to take a look through more digitized photos, audio, and documents from 1921, check out the Tulsa Historical Society\u2019s collection: https://www.tulsahistory.org/exhibit/1921-tulsa-race-massacre/\n\nSign up for the Missing Chapter newsletter to stay up to date with the series:  https://vox.com/missing-chapter\n\nHave an idea for a story that Ranjani should investigate for Missing Chapter?

These fabrics, known by names like polyester and nylon, are cheap to produce, comfortable to wear, and since arriving on the market in the late 1940s, companies have been using more and more of them. Every time we do laundry, a small amount of microfibers are separated from clothes made from these materials. Since those pieces of plastic are extremely small, they're able to make their way through water treatment centers and into marine resources. Once they reach marine habitats, the ocean\u2019s tiniest creatures consume them, and microfibers work their way up the food chain.

Thousands of people from Central America, especially Guatemala and Honduras, are fleeing their home countries, taking a dangerous journey north through Mexico, and claiming asylum in the US. How did this crisis begin? Much of it can be traced back to the 1970s cocaine trade. Cocaine, which is mostly produced in Colombia, used to be shipped by boat and plane across the Caribbean. But in the 80s and 90s, the US cracked down on this route, so traffickers started shipping their drugs through Central America and over land to Mexico. That created a violent and competitive turf war between gangs and organizations in Guatemala and Honduras, and after the governments cracked down, violence only increased, forcing people to flee, often to the US. \n\nThrough Vox Atlas, producer Sam Ellis demonstrates where conflicts occur on a map and the ways in which foreign policy shapes a region.

As a result, defendants languish in jail while waiting for court dates. \n\nWhile in jail, many of them lose their jobs, housing, and parental rights, all of which can weaken their community network, erode domestic relationships, and cost the government money to keep them in jail. \n\nDefenders of cash bail claim it is an effective mechanism for keeping violent criminals in jail. Despite their efforts to protect the status quo, several states have pursued bail reform. These states model their new systems on a pretrial risk assessment system. Risk assessments use algorithms to analyze data about a defendant and make recommendations for their pretrial release. \n\nThe District of Columbia has used risk assessments since the early 1990s with success. But many reform activists are concerned that when cash bail is replaced with risk assessments, courts are using another unjust \u2014 and potentially more biased \u2014 pretrial release mechanism. \n\nNote: The headline for this video has been updated since publishing.\nPrevious headline: The case against cash bail\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

As a result, defendants languish in jail while waiting for court dates. \n\nWhile in jail, many of them lose their jobs, housing, and parental rights, all of which can weaken their community network, erode domestic relationships, and cost the government money to keep them in jail. \n\nDefenders of cash bail claim it is an effective mechanism for keeping violent criminals in jail. Despite their efforts to protect the status quo, several states have pursued bail reform. These states model their new systems on a pretrial risk assessment system. Risk assessments use algorithms to analyze data about a defendant and make recommendations for their pretrial release. \n\nThe District of Columbia has used risk assessments since the early 1990s with success. But many reform activists are concerned that when cash bail is replaced with risk assessments, courts are using another unjust \u2014 and potentially more biased \u2014 pretrial release mechanism. \n\nNote: The headline for this video has been updated since publishing.\nPrevious headline: The case against cash bail\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Smooth jazz is less a genre of music than a highly researched radio format and, although it\u2019s heyday was in the 1990s and it\u2019s mostly associated with Kenny G, its origins go back the mid 1960s when a select few jazz musicians crossed over to pop music and had music purists riling. Artists like Grover Washington Jr.  and George Benson took the style to new heights and created the sound that we all know and love\u2026.to hate. \n\nHow to listen to smooth jazz Spotify playlist: https://open.spotify.com/user/estellecaswell/playlist/44owC0MViG9hE1QNLjChzl?si=jku8eQ39Qji-DngzkLP_eA\n\nSome songs don't just stick in your head, they change the music world forever.

It\u2019s often associated with background music for elevators or the soundtrack at the dentist office. Smooth jazz is less a genre of music than a highly researched radio format and, although it\u2019s heyday was in the 1990s and it\u2019s mostly associated with Kenny G, its origins go back the mid 1960s when a select few jazz musicians crossed over to pop music and had music purists riling. Artists like Grover Washington Jr.  and George Benson took the style to new heights and created the sound that we all know and love\u2026.to hate. \n\nHow to listen to smooth jazz Spotify playlist: https://open.spotify.com/user/estellecaswell/playlist/44owC0MViG9hE1QNLjChzl?si=jku8eQ39Qji-DngzkLP_eA\n\nSome songs don't just stick in your head, they change the music world forever.

It involved bribes between Petrobras, the largest state-owned oil company on the continent, and dozens of engineering firms. It also involved politicians, including three Brazilian presidents, Lula, Dilma Rousseff, and Michel Temer, as well as almost a third of Brazil\u2019s congress. \n\nPoliticians all over Latin America were found guilty of taking bribes and profiting immensely from infrastructure and energy projects all over the continent. The scandal hit places like Itaborai especially hard. The companies involved were fined billions of dollars and laid off hundreds of thousands of workers as their projects abruptly stopped.

It involved bribes between Petrobras, the largest state-owned oil company on the continent, and dozens of engineering firms. It also involved politicians, including three Brazilian presidents, Lula, Dilma Rousseff, and Michel Temer, as well as almost a third of Brazil\u2019s congress. \n\nPoliticians all over Latin America were found guilty of taking bribes and profiting immensely from infrastructure and energy projects all over the continent. The scandal hit places like Itaborai especially hard. The companies involved were fined billions of dollars and laid off hundreds of thousands of workers as their projects abruptly stopped. Four years later, Brazil is still dealing with the fallout. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The history of the keyboard default involves a gaming legend and the start of a new era in games.\n\nCorrection: At 3:36, a previous version of this video misassigned the keys, the error has been fixed\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nTo see more of Thresh, check out the eSports episode of Explained on Netflix: www.netflix.com/explained\n\nIn this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox\u2019s Phil Edwards explores the history of a common default keyboard configuration among gamers. Though there\u2019s an inherent logic to WASD \u2014 it just works well \u2014 there\u2019s also a story behind how it became a near-universal standard.\n\nDennis \u201cThresh\u201d Fong was one of the first pro gamers to go mainstream playing the first person shooter Quake.

Nature Communications, 2017.\n\nThe Global Positioning System, or GPS, is changing the sport of running. Using GPS makes it easier to track, analyze, and share data about your runs. Some people, like Gene Lu, use the technology to create elaborate drawings, but you don\u2019t need to be an artist in order to use GPS to improve your running. \n\nResearchers at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted a study and determined that runners who share their efforts on social networks tend to run farther, faster, and longer than those who do not. With GPS, it\u2019s easy to track and share data about your run. Along with the proliferation of GPS technology, the number of fitness-focused social networks has also increased. Now, runners have many options for where they can go to share their runs: Strava, Nike Run Club, MapMyRun and many others have all made sharing your run easy by developing mobile apps that users can download to their phones. \n\nWhether you\u2019re like Gene, who uploads elaborate runs mapped to look like Darth Vader, or just using the app to track your daily jog, social network sharing, made even easier by GPS tracking, can help you improve.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Nature Communications, 2017.\n\nThe Global Positioning System, or GPS, is changing the sport of running. Using GPS makes it easier to track, analyze, and share data about your runs. Some people, like Gene Lu, use the technology to create elaborate drawings, but you don\u2019t need to be an artist in order to use GPS to improve your running. \n\nResearchers at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted a study and determined that runners who share their efforts on social networks tend to run farther, faster, and longer than those who do not. With GPS, it\u2019s easy to track and share data about your run. Along with the proliferation of GPS technology, the number of fitness-focused social networks has also increased. Now, runners have many options for where they can go to share their runs: Strava, Nike Run Club, MapMyRun and many others have all made sharing your run easy by developing mobile apps that users can download to their phones. \n\nWhether you\u2019re like Gene, who uploads elaborate runs mapped to look like Darth Vader, or just using the app to track your daily jog, social network sharing, made even easier by GPS tracking, can help you improve.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis appear around the boundaries of the several, fast moving, tectonic plates that make up the region. When the plates collide, they create areas of volatility. \n\nThe Ring of Fire sees more natural disasters than anywhere else on Earth, but what makes it particularly dangerous is that few countries are prepared. \n\nTo truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It\u2019s known as the Telstar ball, and it was created thanks to TV.\n\nThe 1966 World Cup in England  was broadcast live across the globe and it was at this point that television became a huge part of the sport. Thanks to the BBC, it was seen by four hundred million people. But spotting the ball was a bit challenging.\n\nBack then, soccer balls looked more like reddish-brown volleyballs. And on black-and-white TVs, it didn\u2019t really stand out from the green field. \n\nBy the 1970 World Cup, the soccer ball had changed to that classic Telstar. The contrasting panels made it stand out on TV. Plus, the players loved it because the 32 panels brought the ball closer to an actual sphere. \n\nThis year\u2019s World Cup ball is called the Telstar 18, a nod to the original design. While the panels have changed to just six propeller-shaped pieces to make the ball even more spherical, the black-and-white checkered design is back.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It\u2019s known as the Telstar ball, and it was created thanks to TV.\n\nThe 1966 World Cup in England  was broadcast live across the globe and it was at this point that television became a huge part of the sport. Thanks to the BBC, it was seen by four hundred million people. But spotting the ball was a bit challenging.\n\nBack then, soccer balls looked more like reddish-brown volleyballs. And on black-and-white TVs, it didn\u2019t really stand out from the green field. \n\nBy the 1970 World Cup, the soccer ball had changed to that classic Telstar. The contrasting panels made it stand out on TV. Plus, the players loved it because the 32 panels brought the ball closer to an actual sphere. \n\nThis year\u2019s World Cup ball is called the Telstar 18, a nod to the original design. While the panels have changed to just six propeller-shaped pieces to make the ball even more spherical, the black-and-white checkered design is back.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

And yet we are routinely exposed to noise much louder than that in everyday situations.\n\nOur world is increasingly noisy and our bars, restaurants, gyms, and streets all produce decibel levels that can cause harm to our hearing in mere minutes. \n\nHearing loss is incredibly common and is the fourth highest disability worldwide. One in four American adults shows signs of noise-induced hearing loss, and the problem is only going to get worse.\n\nWhile hearing damage is irreversible, it's also completely preventable. Watch for tips on how to protect your ears even in incredibly loud environments.\n\nFor more of Julia's reporting on noise and hearing loss check out her articles:\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/5/31/17393394/spinning-cycling-exercise-loud-music-hearing-loss\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/4/18/17168504/restaurants-noise-levels-loud-decibels\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/26/17275406/restaurant-noise-app\n\nTo check the noise levels around you download an app like Decibel Sound Meter Pro:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/decibel-sound-meter-pro/id1227650795?mt=8\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "Our ears are exposed to dangerous levels of noise every single day.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nHealth organizations warn that continual exposure to noise levels above 70 decibels can potentially damage your ears. And yet we are routinely exposed to noise much louder than that in everyday situations.\n\nOur world is increasingly noisy and our bars, restaurants, gyms, and streets all produce decibel levels that can cause harm to our hearing in mere minutes. \n\nHearing loss is incredibly common and is the fourth highest disability worldwide. One in four American adults shows signs of noise-induced hearing loss, and the problem is only going to get worse.\n\nWhile hearing damage is irreversible, it's also completely preventable. Watch for tips on how to protect your ears even in incredibly loud environments.\n\nFor more of Julia's reporting on noise and hearing loss check out her articles:\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/5/31/17393394/spinning-cycling-exercise-loud-music-hearing-loss\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/4/18/17168504/restaurants-noise-levels-loud-decibels\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/26/17275406/restaurant-noise-app\n\nTo check the noise levels around you download an app like Decibel Sound Meter Pro:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/decibel-sound-meter-pro/id1227650795?mt=8\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But in Sweden, Denmark and France, they lead around three quarters of deliveries. In Great Britain, they deliver half of all babies, including all three of Kate Middleton\u2019s.

But using new technology, can we make digital goods that are... rare? \n\nThat\u2019s the question behind CryptoKitties, a new game to buy, breed, and sell digital cats on the blockchain. These cats are more similar to real-world collectibles like beanie babies or baseball cards than they are to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. \n\nIn just the last few months, a whole community of third party sites and services has formed around CryptoKitties. And fans have spent more than $23 million playing along. \n\nAll of this is made possible by the clever and surprising code behind the game. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But using new technology, can we make digital goods that are... rare? \n\nThat\u2019s the question behind CryptoKitties, a new game to buy, breed, and sell digital cats on the blockchain. These cats are more similar to real-world collectibles like beanie babies or baseball cards than they are to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. \n\nIn just the last few months, a whole community of third party sites and services has formed around CryptoKitties. And fans have spent more than $23 million playing along. \n\nAll of this is made possible by the clever and surprising code behind the game. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

These debates often pit gun control activists against the National Rifle Association (NRA), which claims to speak on behalf of gun owners. But in reality, the NRA represents the interest of gun manufacturers.\n\nThe group gets millions of dollars in donations from gun companies every year, and millions more through the sale of ad space in NRA publications. That financial allegiance means the NRA is similar to organizations like the Tobacco Institute -- an industry lobbying group primarily interested in protecting their product. \n\nSo why do news networks keep inviting them to debate gun violence?\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

These debates often pit gun control activists against the National Rifle Association (NRA), which claims to speak on behalf of gun owners. But in reality, the NRA represents the interest of gun manufacturers.\n\nThe group gets millions of dollars in donations from gun companies every year, and millions more through the sale of ad space in NRA publications. That financial allegiance means the NRA is similar to organizations like the Tobacco Institute -- an industry lobbying group primarily interested in protecting their product. \n\nSo why do news networks keep inviting them to debate gun violence?\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Today, music is an essential part of the sport and there\u2019s a hidden strategy behind how they pick their songs. For a long time, figure skaters skated to classics like Carmen, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote. Not only because it\u2019s great music but because of the clear story line and the dynamic characters in them. \n\nBut this is all changing. In 2014, the ISU changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. Now with a wider range of music to choose from \u2014 some skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for Lil Jon. Will this be a new era of figure skating?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Today, music is an essential part of the sport and there\u2019s a hidden strategy behind how they pick their songs. For a long time, figure skaters skated to classics like Carmen, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote. Not only because it\u2019s great music but because of the clear story line and the dynamic characters in them. \n\nBut this is all changing. In 2014, the ISU changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. Now with a wider range of music to choose from \u2014 some skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for Lil Jon. Will this be a new era of figure skating?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

In fact, female hockey players are reporting a higher concussion rate than nearly all sports sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In several studies, female hockey players have reported concussions more often than men\u2019s college football, and at a rate that is comparable to men\u2019s college wrestling and men\u2019s college ice hockey. \n\nCompared to sports like women\u2019s tennis or women\u2019s basketball, hockey is faster, played on harder surfaces, and involves more collisions, which partly explains the high rate of concussions but doesn\u2019t account for the fact that female athletes are reporting more concussions than male athletes who also play hockey. In fact, several surveys have demonstrated that, besides hockey, female athletes consistently report a higher concussion rate than male athletes playing the same gender comparable sport (e.g basketball, soccer, softball/baseball).\n\nThe reasons why are unclear, but this video highlights some of the plausible factors, including: gender bias, reporting bias, differences in style of play (for example, body checking is allowed in men\u2019s hockey and is illegal in women\u2019s hockey), hormonal differences (progesterone is of particular interest to researchers), neck strength, and differences in the structure of nerve fibers called axons. \n\nTo help understand how these factors might influence the concussion rates, this video features interviews with University of North Carolina researcher Zachary Kerr and retired US Women\u2019s Hockey player Josephine Pucci, who ended her career following several concussions.

It was a formula created by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet. It takes your weight (sorry my fellow Americans, everyone else is on the metric system) in kilograms divides and divides it by height in meters squared. And from this you get a number that represent your total body mass relative to your height and weight. The ranges go from underweight to obese, and one decimal point can tip you in either direction. BMI has been used to study obesity in large populations, and for the most part it\u2019s okay for those types of studies. However, when individual health is the topic at hand, using the body mass index can make judging a person\u2019s health a little bit trickier.\n\nSee the state of obesity in your area:\nhttps://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/\n\nCDC\u2019s BMI considerations for practitioners:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/obesity/downloads/bmiforpactitioners.pdf\n\nAnd to check Marshawn Lynchs stats visit:\nhttps://www.playerprofiler.com/nfl/marshawn-lynch/\nhttp://www.nfl.com/player/marshawnlynch/2495663/combine\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "The way we define obesity is flawed.\n\nRead more about Body Mass Index's flaws on Vox.com: http://bit.ly/2nxeQ2U\n\nThe body mass index, better known as BMI, is a measure of obesity that has been in use for over 200 years. It was a formula created by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet. It takes your weight (sorry my fellow Americans, everyone else is on the metric system) in kilograms divides and divides it by height in meters squared. And from this you get a number that represent your total body mass relative to your height and weight. The ranges go from underweight to obese, and one decimal point can tip you in either direction. BMI has been used to study obesity in large populations, and for the most part it\u2019s okay for those types of studies. However, when individual health is the topic at hand, using the body mass index can make judging a person\u2019s health a little bit trickier.\n\nSee the state of obesity in your area:\nhttps://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/\n\nCDC\u2019s BMI considerations for practitioners:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/obesity/downloads/bmiforpactitioners.pdf\n\nAnd to check Marshawn Lynchs stats visit:\nhttps://www.playerprofiler.com/nfl/marshawn-lynch/\nhttp://www.nfl.com/player/marshawnlynch/2495663/combine\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

After decades of little progress, the combination of big data and advances in computer hardware have brought AI applications to life: from self-driving cars to home assistants to augmented reality and instant language translation. If some of these applications feel like science fiction it's because deep learning algorithms are powering a true breakthrough in machine intelligence. But with these truly impressive advances comes a great deal of hype: fears of terminator-type bots turning on humans and stealing all our jobs. In this video we sort out the fact from fiction in this very exciting field. \n\n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

After decades of little progress, the combination of big data and advances in computer hardware have brought AI applications to life: from self-driving cars to home assistants to augmented reality and instant language translation. If some of these applications feel like science fiction it's because deep learning algorithms are powering a true breakthrough in machine intelligence. But with these truly impressive advances comes a great deal of hype: fears of terminator-type bots turning on humans and stealing all our jobs. In this video we sort out the fact from fiction in this very exciting field. \n\n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

And perhaps no one knows this better than would-be African migrants to the European Union. In North Africa, on the border of Morocco, there's a Spanish town called Melilla. It's technically Europe.\n\nSo undocumented migrants and refugees, asylum seekers, wait in limbo for a chance to scale the fence and apply for asylum in Europe. It's the first of many, many hurdles. And it's a tall one. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Spain & Morocco (https://youtu.be/LY_Yiu2U2Ts)\n\nThe sixth and last Vox Borders episode deals with a border between Morocco and Spain. The journey to asylum is never easy. And perhaps no one knows this better than would-be African migrants to the European Union. In North Africa, on the border of Morocco, there's a Spanish town called Melilla. It's technically Europe.\n\nSo undocumented migrants and refugees, asylum seekers, wait in limbo for a chance to scale the fence and apply for asylum in Europe. It's the first of many, many hurdles. And it's a tall one. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Many people recognize Technicolor from The Wizard of Oz, but the technology existed long before then. Two strip Technicolor and three strip Technicolor both revolutionized the film industry and shaped the look of 20th century film.\n\nBut Technicolor also influenced movies through its corporate control of the technology. People like Natalie Kalmus shaped the aesthetic of color films, and directors redesigned their sets and films based on the Technicolor look that the company \u2014 and viewers \u2014 demanded.\n\nThough the process we traditionally recognize as Technicolor is no longer in use (the company does continue), the look remains influential even today.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Many people recognize Technicolor from The Wizard of Oz, but the technology existed long before then. Two strip Technicolor and three strip Technicolor both revolutionized the film industry and shaped the look of 20th century film.\n\nBut Technicolor also influenced movies through its corporate control of the technology. People like Natalie Kalmus shaped the aesthetic of color films, and directors redesigned their sets and films based on the Technicolor look that the company \u2014 and viewers \u2014 demanded.\n\nThough the process we traditionally recognize as Technicolor is no longer in use (the company does continue), the look remains influential even today.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

They don't visit the doctor more than other developed countries:\nhttp://international.commonwealthfund.org/stats/annual_physician_visits/\n\nBut the price we pay for that visit - for a procedure - it costs way more:\nhttp://static1.squarespace.com/static/518a3cfee4b0a77d03a62c98/t/57d3ca9529687f1a257e9e26/1473497751062/2015+Comparative+Price+Report+09.09.16.pdf\n\nThe price you pay for the same procedure, at the same hospital, may vary enormously depending on what kind of health insurance you have in the US.\n\nThat's because of bargaining power. Government programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, can ask for a lower price from health service providers because they have the numbers: the hospital has to comply or else risk losing the business of millions of Americans.\n\nThere are dozens of private health insurance providers in the United States and they each need to bargain for prices with hospitals and doctors. The numbers of people private insurances represent are much less than the government programs. That means a higher price when you go to the doctor or fill a prescription.\n\nUninsured individuals have the least bargaining power. Without any insurance, you will pay the highest price.\n\nFor more health care policy content, check out The Impact, a podcast about the human consequences of policy-making.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-impact/id1294325824?mt=2\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

In particular, 52,000 unaccompanied children were detained between October 2013 and June 2014. With what seemed to be a looming humanitarian crisis to deal with, the Obama administration enlisted the help of Mexico, and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto's administration. \n\nTogether, they launched the Southern Border Program initiative: the U.S. provided funding, equipment, and training to Mexico in exchange for a crackdown along Mexico's southern border. After all, many would-be migrants from Central America to the U.S. must pass through Mexico first. \n\nThis policy worked for a few years, but levels of undocumented migrants are on the rise again. And the mounting human costs make it increasingly difficult to call a success.",

In particular, 52,000 unaccompanied children were detained between October 2013 and June 2014. With what seemed to be a looming humanitarian crisis to deal with, the Obama administration enlisted the help of Mexico, and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto's administration. \n\nTogether, they launched the Southern Border Program initiative: the U.S. provided funding, equipment, and training to Mexico in exchange for a crackdown along Mexico's southern border. After all, many would-be migrants from Central America to the U.S. must pass through Mexico first. \n\nThis policy worked for a few years, but levels of undocumented migrants are on the rise again. And the mounting human costs make it increasingly difficult to call a success."

The causes are complicated, but non-competitive cable markets, misguided government funding, and infrastructural obstacles have limited expansion up until now. Despite the troubles, some rural Americans are receiving internet via both wireless and wireline systems, but the internet service many receive falls short of the 25mbps up/3mbps down set by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015 during the Obama Administration. Receiving that level of service typically requires a wireline connection provided by fiber optic cable, which many rural residents don't have because the remote territories that would be served are hard to reach and require massive investments that private cable companies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast aren't willing to make. If service is available, it is often much more expensive than similar service in urban markets. An idea for solving the problem might be to adopt the funding model similar to the one that helped expand rural electrification during the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At that time, the government paid local electric cooperatives willing to do the work to provide electricity in their communities. Unlike electrification, there are many models for broadband deployment, including cooperatives, but also municipal broadband, private companies and other public-private partnerships. If Trump's government plans to spend more money on rural broadband, then following the model of electrification might help correct some of the funding troubles that have plagued broadband expansion up to this point.\n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Three separate storylines tell the tale of the famed World War II evacuation in a intense two hours of film. A lot of that feeling has to do with how the film's score uses Shepard tones\u00a0\u2014\u00a0layered sound waves that simulate a constant ascent in tone \u2014\u00a0to create a sensation of building tension. They're a personal favorite trick of Nolan's: he's based sound effects and entire soundtracks with other composers on the auditory illusion. In Dunkirk, composer Hans Zimmer crafted his soundtrack around the effect \u2014\u00a0and it's an auditory masterpiece. \n\nRead Nolan's interview with Business Insider on the music of Dunkirk: https://goo.gl/SV4Qpb\n\nShepard tone imagery from EnjoyPA on freesound.org: https://goo.gl/37Hd2P\n\nShepard tone sound effect from Alexander on orangefreesounds.com: https://goo.gl/NnUe7B\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Three separate storylines tell the tale of the famed World War II evacuation in a intense two hours of film. A lot of that feeling has to do with how the film's score uses Shepard tones\u00a0\u2014\u00a0layered sound waves that simulate a constant ascent in tone \u2014\u00a0to create a sensation of building tension. They're a personal favorite trick of Nolan's: he's based sound effects and entire soundtracks with other composers on the auditory illusion. In Dunkirk, composer Hans Zimmer crafted his soundtrack around the effect \u2014\u00a0and it's an auditory masterpiece. \n\nRead Nolan's interview with Business Insider on the music of Dunkirk: https://goo.gl/SV4Qpb\n\nShepard tone imagery from EnjoyPA on freesound.org: https://goo.gl/37Hd2P\n\nShepard tone sound effect from Alexander on orangefreesounds.com: https://goo.gl/NnUe7B\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Will Chilton and Paul Mackie of Mobility Lab explain. \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nThe cities we live in are shaped by the way we get around them. Over the past 60 years, with more and more people opting to drive cars, the need for parking spaces has increased with the boom in driving. \nTo accommodate that demand early on, cities and towns started requiring developers to include parking with their new buildings after World War II. These policies, known as mandatory parking minimums, set precise standards for parking spaces for each building. And these parking spaces don't come cheap.  \n\nTo learn much more on free parking's affect on cities, Donald Shoup's book is here: https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X\n\nAnd Mobility Lab, who helped make this video, covers many more issues around infrastructure is here: https://mobilitylab.org/ \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Over the past 60 years, with more and more people opting to drive cars, the need for parking spaces has increased with the boom in driving. \nTo accommodate that demand early on, cities and towns started requiring developers to include parking with their new buildings after World War II. These policies, known as mandatory parking minimums, set precise standards for parking spaces for each building. And these parking spaces don't come cheap.  \n\nTo learn much more on free parking's affect on cities, Donald Shoup's book is here: https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X\n\nAnd Mobility Lab, who helped make this video, covers many more issues around infrastructure is here: https://mobilitylab.org/ \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                "description": "The 2014 film was an animation feat \u2014\u00a0but it was built on the legacy of homemade fan movies. \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nWhen you watch installments of the Warner Bros. line of Lego movies, it's hard not to be struck by how realistic the animation is. It isn't quite traditional stop motion \u2014 but it sure looks as if it could be. That's largely thanks to the work of the animators at Animal Logic, a Sydney-based visual effects studio that has worked on The Lego Movie, The Lego Batman Movie, and the upcoming The Lego Ninjago Movie. Powered by live action filming techniques and a close attention to detail, the studio has helped reinvent what Lego animations can look like. But they owe a lot of that aesthetic to the influence of fan films. Since the early 1970s, enthusiasts have made home movies with their own Lego sets. They're called Brickfilms \u2014\u00a0and they've grown into a sizable community producing great movies and helping many young animators get their start. The Lego Movie animators learned from what made those home movies so good by embracing the limitations of the medium, and creating a world that anyone could could rebuild at home. \n\nCheck out some of the Brickfilms we showed in this video: \n\nThe Magic Portal: https://youtu.be/jde4qHbCtSg\nJourney to the Moon: https://youtu.be/SW583kCiOWo\nMatrix 2003: https://archive.org/details/Matrix2003\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego: https://archive.org/details/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrailInLegoFlv\nTapporalli 2020: https://archive.org/details/tapporalli\nPredator Montage: https://archive.org/details/PredatorMontageClip\nONE: A Space Odyssey: https://archive.org/details/oneaspaceodyssey\nKrieg der Steine: https://archive.org/details/KriegDerSteine\nBatman Begins Montage: https://archive.org/details/Batman_Begins_Montage_clip\nDelivery: https://archive.org/details/DeliveryH264\nStar Wars Brickfilm: https://archive.org/details/Danstarwarsbrickfilm-test\nVictim: https://archive.org/details/Victim_h264\n\nFor a great explainer on how to make your own Brickfilm at home, check out this video: https://youtu.be/ukFWYe-ZeTw\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                    "description": "The 2014 film was an animation feat \u2014\u00a0but it was built on the legacy of homemade fan movies. \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nWhen you watch installments of the Warner Bros. line of Lego movies, it's hard not to be struck by how realistic the animation is. It isn't quite traditional stop motion \u2014 but it sure looks as if it could be. That's largely thanks to the work of the animators at Animal Logic, a Sydney-based visual effects studio that has worked on The Lego Movie, The Lego Batman Movie, and the upcoming The Lego Ninjago Movie. Powered by live action filming techniques and a close attention to detail, the studio has helped reinvent what Lego animations can look like. But they owe a lot of that aesthetic to the influence of fan films. Since the early 1970s, enthusiasts have made home movies with their own Lego sets. They're called Brickfilms \u2014\u00a0and they've grown into a sizable community producing great movies and helping many young animators get their start. The Lego Movie animators learned from what made those home movies so good by embracing the limitations of the medium, and creating a world that anyone could could rebuild at home. \n\nCheck out some of the Brickfilms we showed in this video: \n\nThe Magic Portal: https://youtu.be/jde4qHbCtSg\nJourney to the Moon: https://youtu.be/SW583kCiOWo\nMatrix 2003: https://archive.org/details/Matrix2003\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego: https://archive.org/details/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrailInLegoFlv\nTapporalli 2020: https://archive.org/details/tapporalli\nPredator Montage: https://archive.org/details/PredatorMontageClip\nONE: A Space Odyssey: https://archive.org/details/oneaspaceodyssey\nKrieg der Steine: https://archive.org/details/KriegDerSteine\nBatman Begins Montage: https://archive.org/details/Batman_Begins_Montage_clip\nDelivery: https://archive.org/details/DeliveryH264\nStar Wars Brickfilm: https://archive.org/details/Danstarwarsbrickfilm-test\nVictim: https://archive.org/details/Victim_h264\n\nFor a great explainer on how to make your own Brickfilm at home, check out this video: https://youtu.be/ukFWYe-ZeTw\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

He is a Putin proxy that has been in charge of the Russian republic since 2007. Recent reports have alleged that Kadyrov is systematically identifying and persecuting homosexual Chechen citizens. Many have fled the country in fear and have given interviews detailing his plans to kidnap, torture, and kill gay people. \n\nDespite the dark revelations, Kadyrov has continued to maintain an upbeat profile on Instagram, where he is a prolific user. Post by post, Kadyrov has used the social media platform to carefully craft a public image that distracts from his sinister behavior. Online he tends to post pictures of animals, selfies with friends, sports clips, and glamorous footage of Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. \n\nOn the other hand, he also features imagery that hints at the darker aspects of his leadership. Kadyrov has a personal militia, called the \u201cKadyrovtsy\u201d, and in various posts they can be seen shooting guns, performing training exercises, and practicing combat tactics. In doing so, he implies a clear threat to anyone who chooses to cross the Chechen leader. \n\nTwo other common subjects are his religious faith and Vladimir Putin. Kadyrov is a devout Muslim and he leverages his faith to promote a strict interpretation of Islam: one that limits the role of women and endorses cruel punishment. He is also a fervent supporter of Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia. By featuring Putin in his posts, Kadyrov makes his deference to the Russian leader explicit. That is because Putin helped bring Kadyrov to power and affirms the authority of his Chechen subordinate. \n\nAs long as Kadyrov maintains stability in the North Caucasus, Putin will continue to protect Kadyrov. That being said, if anyone is going to hold Kadyrov responsible for the troubling accusations about gay persecution, it will be Vladimir Putin. The more the world takes notice, the more Putin will have to, as well.\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

They look and taste completely different, hail from different parts of the world, and in the US you can\u2019t even find yams at most conventional grocery stores.\n\nThen why do so many American stores label sweet potatoes as yams? The misnomer is partly due to branding strategy, and partly due to a specific evolution of language \u2014 one that stems from the slave trade.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Some of the most delightful reminders of the common ancestry we share with other animals, they show that the building blocks of the human body predate our species by hundreds of millions of years.\n\nForty-two percent of Americans say that humans were created in their present form within the past 10,000 years \u2014 a percentage that hasn't changed much since 1982, when Gallup started polling views on evolution.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence, from the fossil record, comparative anatomy, and genetics, tell another story. But you don't have to read all the research to find signs of our evolutionary history \u2014 you can see it in the vestigial structures in each of our bodies, like the third molars that no longer fit in our mouths.

Some of the most delightful reminders of the common ancestry we share with other animals, they show that the building blocks of the human body predate our species by hundreds of millions of years.\n\nForty-two percent of Americans say that humans were created in their present form within the past 10,000 years \u2014 a percentage that hasn't changed much since 1982, when Gallup started polling views on evolution.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence, from the fossil record, comparative anatomy, and genetics, tell another story. But you don't have to read all the research to find signs of our evolutionary history \u2014 you can see it in the vestigial structures in each of our bodies, like the third molars that no longer fit in our mouths.
