Tibur\u00f3n or \u201cShark\u201d is a chemically-altered weed that is said to be more addictive than cocaine and sells like hotcakes. What chemical is used to create this effect remains a mystery. \n\nThrough spending time with the gang, their clients, their enemies and the Narcotics squad policing it, we learn about the impact this dangerous new drug has had on Honduras. Crucially, we take the toxic weed to a lab to discover if there truly is a secret chemical at the heart of Tibur\u00f3n.\n\nWatch more like this: \n\nIs Scotland the New Cocaine Capital?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1PfRwOAkxI \n\nNew Crystal Meth is Stronger Than Ever\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Cv-7WU4Qo\n\nSmoking Cocaine Mixed with Human Bones: Basuco \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J00Hdtm_Jbw\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

Tibur\u00f3n or \u201cShark\u201d is a chemically-altered weed that is said to be more addictive than cocaine and sells like hotcakes. What chemical is used to create this effect remains a mystery. \n\nThrough spending time with the gang, their clients, their enemies and the Narcotics squad policing it, we learn about the impact this dangerous new drug has had on Honduras. Crucially, we take the toxic weed to a lab to discover if there truly is a secret chemical at the heart of Tibur\u00f3n.\n\nWatch more like this: \n\nIs Scotland the New Cocaine Capital?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1PfRwOAkxI \n\nNew Crystal Meth is Stronger Than Ever\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Cv-7WU4Qo\n\nSmoking Cocaine Mixed with Human Bones: Basuco \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J00Hdtm_Jbw\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

There, we follow a pair of local, low-ranking members eager to prove themselves as soldiers and sicarios (hit men) for the Sinaloa cartel. Though they're currently stuck making drug runs, tailing military trucks, & overseeing other petty assignments throughout the city of Culiac\u00e1n, they'll soon be headed to the mountains of Badiraguato to attend the cartel's underground training camp, where veterans turn hungry young men into willing & able killers.\n\nWith never before seen, exclusive access to the intricate inner-workings of the cartel's recruitment and training systems, we'll get a sense of how Mexico's most powerful organized crime operations prepare their soldiers to wage war & enforce their dominion over their territory. We'll also get inside the heads of the civilians willing to permanently give up everything for a shot at rising through the ranks - ultimately learning both how & why so many young men are sucked into a life of crime & bloodshed.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

There, we follow a pair of local, low-ranking members eager to prove themselves as soldiers and sicarios (hit men) for the Sinaloa cartel. Though they're currently stuck making drug runs, tailing military trucks, & overseeing other petty assignments throughout the city of Culiac\u00e1n, they'll soon be headed to the mountains of Badiraguato to attend the cartel's underground training camp, where veterans turn hungry young men into willing & able killers.\n\nWith never before seen, exclusive access to the intricate inner-workings of the cartel's recruitment and training systems, we'll get a sense of how Mexico's most powerful organized crime operations prepare their soldiers to wage war & enforce their dominion over their territory. We'll also get inside the heads of the civilians willing to permanently give up everything for a shot at rising through the ranks - ultimately learning both how & why so many young men are sucked into a life of crime & bloodshed.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

But rather than dying in peaceful surroundings, their South London housing association home was full of cockroaches, mice and mould. \n\nWhen Kwajo\u2019s pleas for help were ignored, he decided to document his living conditions and share them with the world online to shame his landlord into action. As he did, he realised that his situation was not unique \u2013 and others were also living in horrific conditions. \n\nNow, he continues to expose the UK's dodgiest landlords on  TikTok, Twitter and Instagram. His videos, getting thousands of views, show the very worst of the British housing crisis - sewage running down walls, spider infestations, masses of black mould, and even children's bedrooms covered in cockroaches. \n\nWith his inbox filled with desperate requests from tenants, his platform has become a vital tool in holding all landlords and housing associations to account. \n\nIn our series Super Users, VICE World News explores the latest technology being used to fight crime, trafficking, climate change and social injustice. \n\nCheck out the VICE World News playlist for global reporting you won't find elsewhere: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw613M86o5o4S3BXgi3bCiIVuopQxIMgV\n\nWatch more from this series: \n\nUkrainians Are Bombing Russians with Custom Drones \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqOdnCEbDU4 \n\nThe Forensic Artist Solving Cold Cases \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uogQhvonpmY&t=1s \n\nSpamming a Multi-Billion Dollar Company  \nhttps://youtu.be/4N-zOda3pM8\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "In January 2020, Kwajo Tweneboa watched his father fall ill with terminal cancer. But rather than dying in peaceful surroundings, their South London housing association home was full of cockroaches, mice and mould. \n\nWhen Kwajo\u2019s pleas for help were ignored, he decided to document his living conditions and share them with the world online to shame his landlord into action. As he did, he realised that his situation was not unique \u2013 and others were also living in horrific conditions. \n\nNow, he continues to expose the UK's dodgiest landlords on  TikTok, Twitter and Instagram. His videos, getting thousands of views, show the very worst of the British housing crisis - sewage running down walls, spider infestations, masses of black mould, and even children's bedrooms covered in cockroaches. \n\nWith his inbox filled with desperate requests from tenants, his platform has become a vital tool in holding all landlords and housing associations to account. \n\nIn our series Super Users, VICE World News explores the latest technology being used to fight crime, trafficking, climate change and social injustice. \n\nCheck out the VICE World News playlist for global reporting you won't find elsewhere: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw613M86o5o4S3BXgi3bCiIVuopQxIMgV\n\nWatch more from this series: \n\nUkrainians Are Bombing Russians with Custom Drones \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqOdnCEbDU4 \n\nThe Forensic Artist Solving Cold Cases \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uogQhvonpmY&t=1s \n\nSpamming a Multi-Billion Dollar Company  \nhttps://youtu.be/4N-zOda3pM8\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

But since this is a risky manoeuvre, he recruits the help of a notorious card counter who offers him tips and tricks to have an advantage at the Blackjack table.\n\nAfter a quick tutorial, Taji and the card counter enter a casino in disguise, but things don\u2019t quite go according to plan\u2026\n\nAfter losing everything Taji cannot afford to stick around, and what follows is his attempt to make it back to Sin City by way of a haunted Clown Motel, and a brothel.\n\nWATCH NEXT: \n\nThe VICE Guide to Vegas Part 2: A Male Escort & Mind Reader Help Me on a Blind Date\nhttps://youtu.be/hR0xemWXsXg\n\nThe VICE Guide to Vegas Part 3: Cannabis Tours, Strip Clubs and Fake Bruno Mars https://youtu.be/uA3C-PlTaiQ\n\nFind more from the VICE guide to Las Vegas here: vice.com/guide-to-travel-las-vegas\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

The latest figures also suggest that ketamine is now the fourth drug of choice for young people behind cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine.\n \nThere is a certain cognitive dissonance at the heart of Generation K: On the one hand, we see it as a silly, wonky horse tranquilliser.  On the other hand, it is literally a horse tranquilliser... A horse tranquilliser that can make you piss blood.\n\nAs it has grown in popularity, so have bladder injuries and addictions.  In this report, Matt Shea gets deep into the UK\u2019s Generation K, and finds out how a party drug can go too far.\n\nSpecial thanks to Providence Project.

They\u2019re everywhere.\n\nMany of them are new, and they\u2019re all more potent. \n\nSociety is altering chemicals, and chemicals are altering society back, creating new drug scenes - some funny, some bizarre, some terrifying.\n\nDrugs on TV usually means criminals getting busted or addicts in recovery.

                    "description": "Ketamine has become the generation-defining drug for young Brits.  \n\nA report from November 2020 stated one in 30 young people admitted to taking the drug in the past year \u2013 the highest number since records began and far more than other countries in Europe.  The latest figures also suggest that ketamine is now the fourth drug of choice for young people behind cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine.\n \nThere is a certain cognitive dissonance at the heart of Generation K: On the one hand, we see it as a silly, wonky horse tranquilliser.  On the other hand, it is literally a horse tranquilliser... A horse tranquilliser that can make you piss blood.\n\nAs it has grown in popularity, so have bladder injuries and addictions.  In this report, Matt Shea gets deep into the UK\u2019s Generation K, and finds out how a party drug can go too far.\n\nSpecial thanks to Providence Project.

They\u2019re everywhere.\n\nMany of them are new, and they\u2019re all more potent. \n\nSociety is altering chemicals, and chemicals are altering society back, creating new drug scenes - some funny, some bizarre, some terrifying.\n\nDrugs on TV usually means criminals getting busted or addicts in recovery.  But this series is about the cultures and people that have grown around the substances.\n\nHigh Society will show you how drugs are shaping our world.\n\nWatch more from this series:\n\nThe Truth About Ecstasy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZMETFXFE24\n\nThe Rise and Rise of Psychedelics\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lld8KpTW8RA\n\nThe Most Expensive Rehab in the World\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3nVC0GoVg\n\nThe Viagra Epidemic Among Young Men And Its Dangers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0IdDh7iqBQ\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

They came for an event called \"The Redneck Rave\" - a music festival put on by country rapper, Justin Time, who bills it as the \"biggest country party you'll ever go to.\"  What festival goers didn't sign up for, however, was the absolute chaos that would ensue. \n\nThe Redneck Rave made international news for a throat slashing, log impalement, strangulation, amputated finger, and a slew of petty arrests & hospitalizations. Local law enforcement was completely overwhelmed, claiming festival organizers did little to coordinate with them, other than letting emergency responders onto the premises. In the wake of the media frenzy, Justin Time promises to redeem the Redneck Rave, offering family fun at their following Fall event. \n\nIn this episode of \"Fringes\", VICE's Erica Matson puts on her mud boots to attend the Fall Redneck Rave, exploring modern \"Redneck Culture\"  to find out whether it's as innocent, safe, & wholesome as promised.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nWelcome to VICE:\nEnlightening commentary, authoritative advice, and unique stories you won't find anywhere else.

                "description": "Women in Beed, an impoverished, drought-hit district in the western Indian state of Maharashtra are resorting to getting their uterus removed. Married off at an early age, these women have become a part of the unorganised labour economy, earning as little as 3 dollars after working for 18 hours in sugarcane fields every day, seven days in a week. The fields lack access to basic amenities and this often leads to infections that go untreated for years. When these women seek medical assistance, they are told that a hysterectomy is their only way out. In order to pay for these surgeries they take loans and then end up spending years paying off their debt. In this episode of Politics of Sex, VICE meets some of these women along with social activist Manisha Tokle to figure out how this cycle is trapping them and how medical malpractice is a factor in it as well.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "Women in Beed, an impoverished, drought-hit district in the western Indian state of Maharashtra are resorting to getting their uterus removed. Married off at an early age, these women have become a part of the unorganised labour economy, earning as little as 3 dollars after working for 18 hours in sugarcane fields every day, seven days in a week. The fields lack access to basic amenities and this often leads to infections that go untreated for years. When these women seek medical assistance, they are told that a hysterectomy is their only way out. In order to pay for these surgeries they take loans and then end up spending years paying off their debt. In this episode of Politics of Sex, VICE meets some of these women along with social activist Manisha Tokle to figure out how this cycle is trapping them and how medical malpractice is a factor in it as well.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

Rahul is also a vocal advocate of sobriety and is a counsellor by profession. However, this isn\u2019t what his life looked like a decade back.

He liaises with criminals, either for the release of data that\u2019s being held hostage, or for assurances that the bad guys won't release sensitive information \u2013 including trade secrets, or personal information about high-ranking employees.\n\nIn this episode, we get a glimpse into the false urgency these criminals enforce, how they work on the dark web, and the real-life impact of their hacks as they target businesses, charities and even healthcare \u2013 putting lives at risk in the process.\n\nIn our series Super Users, VICE World News explores the latest technology being used to fight crime, trafficking, climate change and social injustice. \n\nCheck out the VICE World News playlist for global reporting you won't find elsewhere: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw613M86o5o4S3BXgi3bCiIVuopQxIMgV\n\nWatch more from this series:\n\nCatching Pedophiles Using AI \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0vbYBWzNMk \n\nThe Man Unmasking Deepfake Videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb5OwKH-kHg \n\nGoing Inside the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYHLMWmk46c \n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                "description": "Sue Black has dedicated her life to catching child sex abusers.\n\nThe crime itself is unusual, as perpetrators will often record themselves in the act. Generally, they don't show their faces, but sometimes abusers' hands are visible. And, as it turns out, vein patterns in people's hands and forearms are pretty unique.\n\nThrough a project called H-Unique, Sue and her team at Lancaster University are asking the public to send photos of their hands. With the public's help, they want to enable AI to catch child sex abusers across the world in a fraction of the time it takes right now.\n\nIn the fight against some of the world\u2019s most horrendous crimes Sue explains that although DNA has often been the gold standard, hands may hold the key to catching sex abusers.\n\nIn our series Super Users, VICE World News explores the latest technology being used to fight crime, trafficking, climate change and social injustice. \n\nTo make a H-unique contribution, visit their website here: https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/security-lancaster/research/h-unique/\n\nCheck out the VICE World News playlist for global reporting you won't find elsewhere: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw613M86o5o4S3BXgi3bCiIVuopQxIMgV\n\nWatch more from this series:\n\nI Hunt Down Internet Trolls\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Pfkr-TZSk \n\n\u201cI Left Anonymous.

                    "description": "Sue Black has dedicated her life to catching child sex abusers.\n\nThe crime itself is unusual, as perpetrators will often record themselves in the act. Generally, they don't show their faces, but sometimes abusers' hands are visible. And, as it turns out, vein patterns in people's hands and forearms are pretty unique.\n\nThrough a project called H-Unique, Sue and her team at Lancaster University are asking the public to send photos of their hands. With the public's help, they want to enable AI to catch child sex abusers across the world in a fraction of the time it takes right now.\n\nIn the fight against some of the world\u2019s most horrendous crimes Sue explains that although DNA has often been the gold standard, hands may hold the key to catching sex abusers.\n\nIn our series Super Users, VICE World News explores the latest technology being used to fight crime, trafficking, climate change and social injustice. \n\nTo make a H-unique contribution, visit their website here: https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/security-lancaster/research/h-unique/\n\nCheck out the VICE World News playlist for global reporting you won't find elsewhere: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw613M86o5o4S3BXgi3bCiIVuopQxIMgV\n\nWatch more from this series:\n\nI Hunt Down Internet Trolls\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Pfkr-TZSk \n\n\u201cI Left Anonymous.

When he\u2019s home, he breeds exotic fish with a farm of 50 tanks in his 1-bedroom apartment.\n\nIn this edition of SIDE HUSTLES, we meet @AquaMalik, a \u201cfish influencer\u201d who lives with 3000 to 5000 fish (depending on the month) and started breeding when he was seven in Sri Lanka. Malik lets us into his home where he broadcasts his conservationist passion, to the anger of some breeders who feel he\u2019s giving away fish trade secrets. Malik gets back to selling outside his apartment after lockdown, attempts to save virtually extinct species, and shares all that he\u2019s given up and gained from his fish.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

When he\u2019s home, he breeds exotic fish with a farm of 50 tanks in his 1-bedroom apartment.\n\nIn this edition of SIDE HUSTLES, we meet @AquaMalik, a \u201cfish influencer\u201d who lives with 3000 to 5000 fish (depending on the month) and started breeding when he was seven in Sri Lanka. Malik lets us into his home where he broadcasts his conservationist passion, to the anger of some breeders who feel he\u2019s giving away fish trade secrets. Malik gets back to selling outside his apartment after lockdown, attempts to save virtually extinct species, and shares all that he\u2019s given up and gained from his fish.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

Nestled in these forests is Panna Tiger Reserve, an eco-paradise and safe haven for animals, especially tigers. It is a tourist attraction, and a great place to learn about conservation efforts. But Panna Tiger Reserve also hides a secret that tourists often don\u2019t notice \u2014 illegal diamond mining. \n\n\u2018Trouble in Paradise\u2019 is a new series that explores the dark underbelly of popular tourist destinations. In our first episode, VWN host Surabhi Tandon travels to Panna to uncover its secret and figure how conservation and mining strike an uneasy balance in a protected forest.Click here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "Panna, a district in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh is known for its dynamic dry forests, its grasslands, deep gorges with waterfalls and the Ken river, which cuts through the forest and is its lifeline. Nestled in these forests is Panna Tiger Reserve, an eco-paradise and safe haven for animals, especially tigers. It is a tourist attraction, and a great place to learn about conservation efforts. But Panna Tiger Reserve also hides a secret that tourists often don\u2019t notice \u2014 illegal diamond mining. \n\n\u2018Trouble in Paradise\u2019 is a new series that explores the dark underbelly of popular tourist destinations. In our first episode, VWN host Surabhi Tandon travels to Panna to uncover its secret and figure how conservation and mining strike an uneasy balance in a protected forest.Click here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

The goal is to reduce the use of medication and even, in the long run, completely stop using it.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

So how did he find himself lying in his own grave, pretending to be dead? It turns out, his wife Lulu actually wanted him killed, and was working with a man she thought was a hitman to make it happen.\n\nThrough an interview with Ramon and Lieutenant Michael Atkins, we hear how they faked his death to catch Lulu in the act, and ultimately put her in prison for 20 years. \n\nIn a series of candid interviews, Fakes, Frauds & Scammers relives some of the most audacious scams and fraudulent stunts of our time from the mouths of the perpetrators themselves. Whether it\u2019s money, fame or simply an addiction to lying, we find out what motivated these tricksters and whether the highs, lows and ramifications were worth it in the end.\n\nWatch more from this series:\n \nThe Real Life Robin Hood \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJH7WkfCyco&t=2s \n\nHow I stole 2.8 Million as a teenager \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgkf7VGtZfY&t=1s \n \n\u2018Max the Forger\u2019 Specialised in Faking Famous Art\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GTE5bKPgHM&t=1s\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "Ramon Sosa had a seemingly perfect life: he owned a local business in Texas, had a family and a beautiful wife. So how did he find himself lying in his own grave, pretending to be dead? It turns out, his wife Lulu actually wanted him killed, and was working with a man she thought was a hitman to make it happen.\n\nThrough an interview with Ramon and Lieutenant Michael Atkins, we hear how they faked his death to catch Lulu in the act, and ultimately put her in prison for 20 years. \n\nIn a series of candid interviews, Fakes, Frauds & Scammers relives some of the most audacious scams and fraudulent stunts of our time from the mouths of the perpetrators themselves. Whether it\u2019s money, fame or simply an addiction to lying, we find out what motivated these tricksters and whether the highs, lows and ramifications were worth it in the end.\n\nWatch more from this series:\n \nThe Real Life Robin Hood \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJH7WkfCyco&t=2s \n\nHow I stole 2.8 Million as a teenager \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgkf7VGtZfY&t=1s \n \n\u2018Max the Forger\u2019 Specialised in Faking Famous Art\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GTE5bKPgHM&t=1s\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

Whether it\u2019s money, fame or simply an addiction to lying, we find out what motivated these tricksters and whether the highs, lows and ramifications were worth it in the end.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

As the structure grew, he faced complaints from neighbors, resulting in threats from the local government to cease and desist. However, he remained stubborn, jumping through all the hoops officials threw his way so that he could keep the structure standing. Vince, who resides on the same property as his structure, only allows appointments made over the phone. Visitors who show up without an appointment are often turned away. Vince and his Cathedral of Junk encapsulates the infamous slogan, \u201cKeep Austin Weird\u201d.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "Vince Hanneman, AKA The Junk King, has become famous in Austin for the massive, multi-room, 60-ton Cathedral of Junk he has been building on his property since the 80s. As the structure grew, he faced complaints from neighbors, resulting in threats from the local government to cease and desist. However, he remained stubborn, jumping through all the hoops officials threw his way so that he could keep the structure standing. Vince, who resides on the same property as his structure, only allows appointments made over the phone. Visitors who show up without an appointment are often turned away. Vince and his Cathedral of Junk encapsulates the infamous slogan, \u201cKeep Austin Weird\u201d.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

The whole toxic frustration of conspiracy theorists is that they can never be proven wrong \u2013 all evidence against their ideas just becomes part of the conspiracy. \n\nThis is largely why, even though they seem obsessed with science, they always get actual science so wrong. From the moon landing to flat earth to 5G, there has been a constant battle in modern times between science and conspiracy. \n\nIn this episode of Truth Hurts, we look at how science denial has been fueling conspiracy theorists for decades.\n\nWatch more from this series:\n\nWhere Conspiracy Theorists Steal Their Ideas From\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4hpedzjQZ8\n\nThe Most Dangerous Conspiracy Theory in the World\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7o3bVInA2A\n\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

The whole toxic frustration of conspiracy theorists is that they can never be proven wrong \u2013 all evidence against their ideas just becomes part of the conspiracy. \n\nThis is largely why, even though they seem obsessed with science, they always get actual science so wrong. From the moon landing to flat earth to 5G, there has been a constant battle in modern times between science and conspiracy. \n\nIn this episode of Truth Hurts, we look at how science denial has been fueling conspiracy theorists for decades.\n\nWatch more from this series:\n\nWhere Conspiracy Theorists Steal Their Ideas From\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4hpedzjQZ8\n\nThe Most Dangerous Conspiracy Theory in the World\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7o3bVInA2A\n\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Jim opened his Gallery Furniture locations to people seeking shelter. Every year he gives away furniture to families in need and provides hot meals during the holidays. Most recently, Mack converted parts of his main Gallery Furniture location into a trade and high school, helping students who dropped out of public school gain an education.

The fallout of a decades-long armed conflict, a peace process that appears to be coming apart at the seams, an impending economic crisis, and a government with far-right conservative leanings that has failed to appease the growing frustration \u2014all factors driving the anger of everyday Colombians.Those issues were at the forefront of the massive mobilizations that happened at the end of 2019 \u2014the largest in decades\u2014, and have only resurfaced stronger in the wake of the COVID lockdown.\n\nIn this episode of \u201cWhy We Protest\u201d, VICE embeds with some of the youth at the forefront of Colombia\u2019s protest movement.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "On September 9th 2020 a video began circulating on social media of police in Bogota hitting and tazing Javier Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, a father of two, who was abused to death in police custody.\nThe event triggered a wave of protests around Colombia that ended with the killings of 13 protestors by the police. \n\nBut beyond the issue of police brutality, Colombia\u2019s unrest has been brewing for a long time. The fallout of a decades-long armed conflict, a peace process that appears to be coming apart at the seams, an impending economic crisis, and a government with far-right conservative leanings that has failed to appease the growing frustration \u2014all factors driving the anger of everyday Colombians.Those issues were at the forefront of the massive mobilizations that happened at the end of 2019 \u2014the largest in decades\u2014, and have only resurfaced stronger in the wake of the COVID lockdown.\n\nIn this episode of \u201cWhy We Protest\u201d, VICE embeds with some of the youth at the forefront of Colombia\u2019s protest movement.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "In September 2020, 4 upper caste Thakur men allegedly brutally gang-raped and attacked a 19-year-old Dalit woman in India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. She died because of it and the police hurriedly cremated her without the consent of the family. This tragedy led to India actually being forced to deal with its caste problem. In this documentary, we look at the intersection of caste, gender and violence specifically against Dalit women in India.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

Illegal drugs previously associated with hippies and raves are now being used to treat PTSD, depression, anxiety, addiction and obsessive disorders. \n\nThis is the story of how incredible new research is bringing the therapeutic benefits of magic mushrooms, LSD, MDMA and DMT to light \u2013 and how the War on Drugs has needlessly held this research back for 50 years. \n\nIn War On Drugs, we examine the social implications of prohibition worldwide. Any attempt to shut down the trade in drugs such as heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine or weed invariably sets off a chain of events that just makes things worse, leaving a trail of death, illness, violence, slavery, addiction, crime and inequality across the globe.\n \nEveryone loses \u2013 except, in a weird kind of way, the drugs themselves.\n \nWatch more from this series: \n\nHow America Got Hooked on Opioids | The War on Drugs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJc-YI7OWfY\n\nDebunking Crystal Meth Myths | The War on Drugs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-VkWkPs1aw\n\nThe War on Drugs is Racist to the Core | The War on Drugs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf5qFIpJ2sk\n\nKetamine: The Next Big Antidepressant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfmPu8l24wY\n \n\u2018Spice\u2019 is Britain\u2019s Most Dangerous Drug https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L62rHDJFAkg\n \nThe Great MDMA Drought and Its Deadly Consequences https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUNvLPNLxSw\n \nWhy Portugal Decriminalized All Drugs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dU5yiKBqCk\n \nMephedrone: The Drug That Changed Dealing\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvxZyMyc7go&list=UUn8zNIfYAQNdrFRrr8oibKw\n \nIs the Netherlands Turning Into a Narco-State?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig5uP2R_9bg&list=PLDbSvEZka6GGanXjSfH1bQNVheppFQWWo&index=4\n \nHow America Got Hooked on Opioids\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJc-YI7OWfY&list=PLDbSvEZka6GGanXjSfH1bQNVheppFQWWo&index=9\n\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

VICE followed Robb Ryerse, a pastor from Arkansas who in 2018 ran for Congress as a Republican, to understand why they felt the need to take such drastic measures and see if this personal sacrifice was even worth it.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

VICE World News host Zing Tsjeng uncovers the ugly history of the European colonial empires they don\u2019t teach us in schools.\n \nCountries around the world were looted for their treasures, people were oppressed and exploited, and European powers relentlessly profited. The far-reaching repercussions of colonialism are all around us, from our financial institutions to the food we have in our cupboards at home \u2013 and it\u2019s about time we took notice.\n\nWatch more from this series:\n \nHow Banks Made Money From Slavery\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUfMkIx7Ypg\n \nHow Britain Got China Hooked on Opium\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbHAWNQRV70\n \nHow Britain Stole $45 Trillion from India with Trains\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_jGPf764d0\n \nHow the British Empire Exported Homophobia\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DQYu4iBNiQ\n\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

The movement was in response to laws that essentially stripped women of their human rights. Their tireless campaigning did not stop until the end of Zia's rule and the restoration of democracy.\n\nToday, the women\u2019s movement in Pakistan is revived and has been standing up for women and minority rights every year since 2018, where they\u2019ve banded together on 8th March, walking and chanting and making themselves heard. They call themselves the Aurat March (women\u2019s march) and in cities across Pakistan, women come out of their houses to reclaim the streets. In this documentary, we look at what goes into the making of the historic Lahore chapter of Pakistan\u2019s Aurat March. We try and unpack what it means to be a woman in Pakistan today, and why they march.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "The women\u2019s movement in Pakistan had begun in the late 1970s as a response to the edicts of General Zia-ul-Haq\u2019s brutal regime. The movement was in response to laws that essentially stripped women of their human rights. Their tireless campaigning did not stop until the end of Zia's rule and the restoration of democracy.\n\nToday, the women\u2019s movement in Pakistan is revived and has been standing up for women and minority rights every year since 2018, where they\u2019ve banded together on 8th March, walking and chanting and making themselves heard. They call themselves the Aurat March (women\u2019s march) and in cities across Pakistan, women come out of their houses to reclaim the streets. In this documentary, we look at what goes into the making of the historic Lahore chapter of Pakistan\u2019s Aurat March. We try and unpack what it means to be a woman in Pakistan today, and why they march.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

It\u2019s become an ubiquitous image in the West of the pro-democracy protests, but in China it\u2019s like it\u2019s been airbrushed out of history. Even getting the roll out of China was tricky, it was smuggled out in a box of tea by a French student heading for Paris. Stuart Franklin talks us through the events leading up to the photo and how it went on to be considered one of the greatest images of the 20th Century. \n\nWhen you are on the front line, picking up a camera can often result in an image that immortalises a moment in time. From pictures captured during armed conflict to anti-facist protests, global pandemics to the start of a revolution - iconic photos reveal exactly what happened there and then. In this Developing News series, VICE interviews photographers whose photos have become synonymous with important world events. The photographers relive the story behind the photos, telling their tales from the front line of battlefields and hospitals, and reflecting on their journey to becoming a photographer. We hear how they sought out to document the truth, even risking their lives, to provide proof of events that stay long after the memories fade.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

The result is a hybrid between a strangely-satisfying look into the technical processes of modern art, but also a portrait of the world\u2019s leading creators, their lives, and their inspiration. \n\nPolly Verity is a \u201cpaper sculptor\u201d from Wales who has enchanted her followers with her remarkable ability to create intricate, three-dimensional works of art using mainly plain, white paper. \n\nIn the third episode of \u201cThe Mind\u2019s Eye\u201d, we\u2019ll follow Polly as she brings a whole new dimension to the age-old art of origami.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

The result is a hybrid between a strangely-satisfying look into the technical processes of modern art, but also a portrait of the world\u2019s leading creators, their lives, and their inspiration. \n\nPolly Verity is a \u201cpaper sculptor\u201d from Wales who has enchanted her followers with her remarkable ability to create intricate, three-dimensional works of art using mainly plain, white paper. \n\nIn the third episode of \u201cThe Mind\u2019s Eye\u201d, we\u2019ll follow Polly as she brings a whole new dimension to the age-old art of origami.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                "description": "There is a misguided idea that India should be grateful for the democracy, law and trains that the British Empire brought to their country. But along with these \u2018gifts\u2019, Britain also stole $45 trillion from India during its long and oppressive rule, which culminated in the biggest mass migration in human history during the Partition of India and Pakistan. \n\nAnd those beloved trains? They became the sites of mass slaughter as violent clashes occurred when over four million people were uprooted from their homes and forced to trek to a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a Hindu-majority India. VICE World News host Zing Tsjeng reveals exactly why India shouldn\u2019t be grateful for their trains. \n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\nWatch episode one of Empires of Dirt, looking at how the City of London and its financial institutions profited from slavery in America long after the slave trade was abolished: https://youtu.be/rUfMkIx7Ypg\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "There is a misguided idea that India should be grateful for the democracy, law and trains that the British Empire brought to their country. But along with these \u2018gifts\u2019, Britain also stole $45 trillion from India during its long and oppressive rule, which culminated in the biggest mass migration in human history during the Partition of India and Pakistan. \n\nAnd those beloved trains? They became the sites of mass slaughter as violent clashes occurred when over four million people were uprooted from their homes and forced to trek to a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a Hindu-majority India. VICE World News host Zing Tsjeng reveals exactly why India shouldn\u2019t be grateful for their trains. \n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\nWatch episode one of Empires of Dirt, looking at how the City of London and its financial institutions profited from slavery in America long after the slave trade was abolished: https://youtu.be/rUfMkIx7Ypg\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "VICE World News host Zing Tsjeng explores how the City of London and its financial institutions profited from slavery in America long after the slave trade was abolished.\n\nEmpires of Dirt is a show about Europeans getting rich at the expense of everyone else. VICE World News host Zing Tsjeng uncovers the ugly history of the European colonial empires they don\u2019t teach us in schools.\n\nCountries around the world were looted for their treasures, people were oppressed and exploited and European powers relentlessly profited. The far-reaching repercussions of colonialism are all around us, from our financial institutions to the food we have in our cupboards at home - and it\u2019s about time we took notice.\n\nWatch the next episode from Empires of Dirt, in which we look at how Britain stole $45 trillion from India during its long and oppressive rule: https://youtu.be/x_jGPf764d0\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

And, in South Asia, Nepal, India, and Bangladesh top the list of countries where this vile trade is literally making a killing. In this documentary, our focus is on the Nepal-India border as we try to figure out why and how do close to 50 Nepalese women disappear from that border area every day.\n\nNote: Ms. Nirmala Thapa at 15:19 minutes was credited incorrectly.

The experiment might open up Will to the universe \u2014 or it might just crush his soul.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                "description": "When they infiltrated three morning news programs by passing themselves off as an improbable strongman duo, Nick Prueher and Joe Pickett were not the first people to prank TV News.\n\nLeft-leaning activists The Yes Men famously infiltrated BBC, and right-wing provocateur James O'Keefe unsuccessfully attempted to plant a false story in the Washington Post. More frequently, tricksters have no overt political agenda, happy to simply interrupt serious or anodyne programing with the absurd or profane. Whatever the perpetrators\u2019 intention, the result of these stunts is a demonstration of the fallibility of newsgathering operations. As such, out of embarrassment or pragmatism, the targeted media companies generally avoid legal retaliation against the pranksters. That all changed with Prueher and Pickett.\n\nGray Television owns and/or operates over 100 local television stations across the country. The conglomerate had previously been fooled by two other bogus characters created by Prueher and Pickett and decided to sue the comedy team after the phony strongmen, dubbed Chop and Steele, conquered their airwaves. One of the charges was copyright infringement, over clips of the broadcast Prueher and Pickett used in a montage, which they believe is protected by \u201cfair use\u201d laws. The more serious charges were \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cconspiracy to commit fraud.\u201d\n\nThe legal battle was shaping up to be precedent-setting, but almost a year after the charges were filed, as VICE News was reporting the story, there was a sudden twist. The two sides came to an unexpected settlement. Without a judge to make a final ruling each party declared itself the de facto winner of the litigation.\n\nWatch the story below to see the arguments both sides present for their victory, in what Prueher described as \u201cA really stupid first amendment battle.\u201d\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "description": "When they infiltrated three morning news programs by passing themselves off as an improbable strongman duo, Nick Prueher and Joe Pickett were not the first people to prank TV News.\n\nLeft-leaning activists The Yes Men famously infiltrated BBC, and right-wing provocateur James O'Keefe unsuccessfully attempted to plant a false story in the Washington Post. More frequently, tricksters have no overt political agenda, happy to simply interrupt serious or anodyne programing with the absurd or profane. Whatever the perpetrators\u2019 intention, the result of these stunts is a demonstration of the fallibility of newsgathering operations. As such, out of embarrassment or pragmatism, the targeted media companies generally avoid legal retaliation against the pranksters. That all changed with Prueher and Pickett.\n\nGray Television owns and/or operates over 100 local television stations across the country. The conglomerate had previously been fooled by two other bogus characters created by Prueher and Pickett and decided to sue the comedy team after the phony strongmen, dubbed Chop and Steele, conquered their airwaves. One of the charges was copyright infringement, over clips of the broadcast Prueher and Pickett used in a montage, which they believe is protected by \u201cfair use\u201d laws. The more serious charges were \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cconspiracy to commit fraud.\u201d\n\nThe legal battle was shaping up to be precedent-setting, but almost a year after the charges were filed, as VICE News was reporting the story, there was a sudden twist. The two sides came to an unexpected settlement. Without a judge to make a final ruling each party declared itself the de facto winner of the litigation.\n\nWatch the story below to see the arguments both sides present for their victory, in what Prueher described as \u201cA really stupid first amendment battle.\u201d\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

John has never left Milwaukee, but he is recognized by tourists and locals alike as a mascot for the city itself. There's a Facebook group with over 10k followers dedicated to spotting him in the wild, he has a theme song, there is a beer emblazoned with him on the label, and a bobblehead of him is being inducted into the National Bobblehead Museum. He has a yelp page, and there\u2019s a Google Maps page devoted to tracking sightings of The Milverine. He was so commonplace that when he stopped being spotted around town in 2017, news outlets went looking for him.

After moving into the area and discovering the plight of the stray dog population, Lya Battle set out to buy a farm and fill it with all the local canines requiring salvation. Territorio de Zaguates is now a privately funded, volunteer-run haven for nearly 1000 strays who are given free reign of the jungle.

                "description": "For most people, eating nothing but mac and cheese seems like a childhood fantasy. But for 20-year-old Austin Davis, who has been eating nothing but mac and cheese for the past 17 years, it\u2019s not a fantasy -- it\u2019s his reality and has become his affliction. For Austin, it\u2019s about much more than just \u201cliking\u201d mac and cheese. Austin suffers from Selective Eating Disorder, also known as Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, an anxiety disorder that\u2019s characterized by the persistent refusal to eat specific foods or refusal to eat any type of food due to a negative response from certain sensory characteristics of that food. \n\nVICE travels to Florida to meet Austin to learn more about the origins of his eating disorder and join him as he embarks on his journey towards recovery.\n\nFor more information and resources about eating disorders including ARFID, please visit https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/\n\nWatch our full video on what it's like to live with an eating disorder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1TWvXwgKr0\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                "channelId": "UCn8zNIfYAQNdrFRrr8oibKw",
                "description": "In an abandoned building on the outskirts of Karachi, a man dies, anonymous and alone. He does not have a phone or any paperwork on his person, nothing at all to indicate his name or address. A passer-by spots this body, slumped lifeless against a wall, and immediately knows who to call: the Edhi Foundation. Within minutes, the organisation dispatches an ambulance to collect the corpse, and the work of trying to find out who this anonymous man is can begin. \n\nWATCH NEXT: Solving Cold Case Murders with Decomposing Bodies and Forensic Science -- https://youtu.be/lqRo23h01qQ\n\nThis man\u2019s lonely death and the mystery he leaves behind is sadly unremarkable. Each year, approximately 3000 unidentified corpses are found on the streets of Karachi, an ever-expanding mega-city in southern Pakistan. Sometimes they are drug addicts or migrant workers who came to the big city in search of a better life; sometimes they are the victims of the sectarian clashes or gang violence that give Karachi its reputation for violence. In this tightly packed city of over 21 million people, some get lost amongst the heaving mass of brick and bodies, ending up destitute and alone. They are lawaris: without an owner. \n\nAfter his collection by the ambulance, the anonymous man is taken to the Edhi mortuary, one of only two functional cold storage units in the whole city. The staff here are constantly exposed to death, dealing with the victims of bomb attacks and gunfire, as well as stepping in to bear the financial burden of burial for families who are too poor to afford it. At the mortuary, the anonymous man is absorbed into a system that is set up to try to find his loved ones and, even if they cannot be tracked down, to restore him some dignity in death. The Edhi mortuary employees take fingerprints, search the national biometric database, and make phone calls - all the while dealing with a steady flow of people coming into the mortuary to search for their lost loved ones. Sometimes lawaris bodies are reunited with their families, a raw emotional collision of grief and relief. If loved ones are not tracked down, Edhi staff take on the role of family, washing the body and giving full Islamic burial rites at a funeral attended by staff members.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

                    "title": "Unidentified Corpses on the Streets of Karachi, Pakistan",
                    "description": "In an abandoned building on the outskirts of Karachi, a man dies, anonymous and alone. He does not have a phone or any paperwork on his person, nothing at all to indicate his name or address. A passer-by spots this body, slumped lifeless against a wall, and immediately knows who to call: the Edhi Foundation. Within minutes, the organisation dispatches an ambulance to collect the corpse, and the work of trying to find out who this anonymous man is can begin. \n\nWATCH NEXT: Solving Cold Case Murders with Decomposing Bodies and Forensic Science -- https://youtu.be/lqRo23h01qQ\n\nThis man\u2019s lonely death and the mystery he leaves behind is sadly unremarkable. Each year, approximately 3000 unidentified corpses are found on the streets of Karachi, an ever-expanding mega-city in southern Pakistan. Sometimes they are drug addicts or migrant workers who came to the big city in search of a better life; sometimes they are the victims of the sectarian clashes or gang violence that give Karachi its reputation for violence. In this tightly packed city of over 21 million people, some get lost amongst the heaving mass of brick and bodies, ending up destitute and alone. They are lawaris: without an owner. \n\nAfter his collection by the ambulance, the anonymous man is taken to the Edhi mortuary, one of only two functional cold storage units in the whole city. The staff here are constantly exposed to death, dealing with the victims of bomb attacks and gunfire, as well as stepping in to bear the financial burden of burial for families who are too poor to afford it. At the mortuary, the anonymous man is absorbed into a system that is set up to try to find his loved ones and, even if they cannot be tracked down, to restore him some dignity in death. The Edhi mortuary employees take fingerprints, search the national biometric database, and make phone calls - all the while dealing with a steady flow of people coming into the mortuary to search for their lost loved ones. Sometimes lawaris bodies are reunited with their families, a raw emotional collision of grief and relief. If loved ones are not tracked down, Edhi staff take on the role of family, washing the body and giving full Islamic burial rites at a funeral attended by staff members.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

Geen pooiers, drugsdealers en junks \u2013 maar schoonmakers, gidsen van vrijgezellenfeestjes, en het gezelligste raamverhuurbedrijf van Amsterdam, waar prostituees soms een appeltaartje voor elkaar bakken.Click here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0"

Met haar Prostitutie Informatie Centrum probeert ze al 22 jaar mensen in te lichten over het leven op de Wallen, en alle foutieve vooroordelen \u2013 zoals dat alle sekswerkers gedwongen werken \u2013 weg te nemen. We volgen Mariska tijdens een prostitutieworkshop die ze geeft aan Sofia, een meisje dat pas net in het vak is begonnen.\n\nDe Wallen zijn een plek met een berucht imago en waar een hoop vooroordelen over zijn. In onze serie  Achter de Wallen volgen we de mensen die dagelijks in deze buurt werken, om vanuit hun perspectief te zien wat voor wijk dit nu is. Geen pooiers, drugsdealers en junks \u2013 maar schoonmakers, gidsen van vrijgezellenfeestjes, en het gezelligste raamverhuurbedrijf van Amsterdam, waar sekswerkers soms een appeltaartje voor elkaar bakken.

Met haar Prostitutie Informatie Centrum probeert ze al 22 jaar mensen in te lichten over het leven op de Wallen, en alle foutieve vooroordelen \u2013 zoals dat alle sekswerkers gedwongen werken \u2013 weg te nemen. We volgen Mariska tijdens een prostitutieworkshop die ze geeft aan Sofia, een meisje dat pas net in het vak is begonnen.\n\nDe Wallen zijn een plek met een berucht imago en waar een hoop vooroordelen over zijn. In onze serie  Achter de Wallen volgen we de mensen die dagelijks in deze buurt werken, om vanuit hun perspectief te zien wat voor wijk dit nu is. Geen pooiers, drugsdealers en junks \u2013 maar schoonmakers, gidsen van vrijgezellenfeestjes, en het gezelligste raamverhuurbedrijf van Amsterdam, waar sekswerkers soms een appeltaartje voor elkaar bakken.

Former gang members, they often struggle to reconnect with the culture, the language, and the people. \n\nThey are haunted by the stigma of their criminal pasts, which casts a pall over their employment prospects and puts a barrier between them and their compatriots. \n\nGovernment support for returnees is non-existent, wages are low, and with Tonga in the midst of a methamphetamine crisis, the temptations to revert to the lives of crime they hoped to leave behind when they left prison are high.\n\nWATCH NEXT: The Motel for the Homeless and Ex-Prisoners : The Stay Inn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyMlwIiZDRE\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0"

                "description": "Polygamy is largely looked down on in Indonesia, where about 86 percent of Muslims oppose it\u2014but the husbands and wives who practice it believe it\u2019s the ideal form of marriage, and they\u2019re ardent about convincing folks to think the same way. Riski Ramdani has dedicated himself to making the controversial arrangement more mainstream, and he\u2019s gathered a pretty passionate following. But he\u2019s still facing harsh, widespread criticism that polygamy, at its core, is just a form of abuse. \n\nVICE Indonesia met up with Ramdani, his two wives, and their children in West Java for a look inside their unconventional marriage, and to hear why they support the practice, as well as the struggles they face. Then we spoke to a scholar who studies polygamy and a woman who left her polygamist marriage to hear how\u2014for many women\u2014the practice can be traumatizing.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0",

Riski Ramdani has dedicated himself to making the controversial arrangement more mainstream, and he\u2019s gathered a pretty passionate following. But he\u2019s still facing harsh, widespread criticism that polygamy, at its core, is just a form of abuse. \n\nVICE Indonesia met up with Ramdani, his two wives, and their children in West Java for a look inside their unconventional marriage, and to hear why they support the practice, as well as the struggles they face. Then we spoke to a scholar who studies polygamy and a woman who left her polygamist marriage to hear how\u2014for many women\u2014the practice can be traumatizing.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0"

In the past, the few adult stores that existed were hidden behind tinted glass and filled with dirty or outdated toys.

But while K-Pop\u2019s fanbase has diversified, most K-Pop idols haven\u2019t - so what happens when white people try and become K-Pop idols themselves? \n\nOn this episode of 'MINORITY REPORTS,' VICE sent Lee Adams to Seoul, South Korea to meet EXP Edition, the world\u2019s first non-Korean K-Pop group. The group\u2019s 4 members - Koki Tomlinson, Frankie DaPonte, Hunter Kohl and \u0160ime Ko\u0161ta - believe you don\u2019t need to be Korean in order to do K-Pop. When they debuted, EXP Edition faced a lot of criticism from mostly non-Korean K-Pop fans, who claimed the group was misappropriating Korean culture. EXP Edition maintains this pushback happens to anyone trying to break into a new genre of music - but is the group going too far in their attempt to be K-Pop idols? \n\nWe explore the wildly popular world of K-Pop and raise questions of where the line is drawn between cultural appreciation vs cultural appropriation and who should actually draw it.\n\nWATCH MORE MINORITY REPORTS: https://vice.video/2NvWISr\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0",

But while K-Pop\u2019s fanbase has diversified, most K-Pop idols haven\u2019t - so what happens when white people try and become K-Pop idols themselves? \n\nOn this episode of 'MINORITY REPORTS,' VICE sent Lee Adams to Seoul, South Korea to meet EXP Edition, the world\u2019s first non-Korean K-Pop group. The group\u2019s 4 members - Koki Tomlinson, Frankie DaPonte, Hunter Kohl and \u0160ime Ko\u0161ta - believe you don\u2019t need to be Korean in order to do K-Pop. When they debuted, EXP Edition faced a lot of criticism from mostly non-Korean K-Pop fans, who claimed the group was misappropriating Korean culture. EXP Edition maintains this pushback happens to anyone trying to break into a new genre of music - but is the group going too far in their attempt to be K-Pop idols? \n\nWe explore the wildly popular world of K-Pop and raise questions of where the line is drawn between cultural appreciation vs cultural appropriation and who should actually draw it.\n\nWATCH MORE MINORITY REPORTS: https://vice.video/2NvWISr\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0"

                "description": "In the heyday of America's Old West, roughly a fourth of the cowboys were black. But today, the world of professional bull riding, a sport rooted in ranching culture, is predominantly white.\n\nOn this episode of 'MINORITY REPORTS,' VICE sent Lee Adams to Texas to meet Neil Holmes and Ezekiel Mitchell\u2014two black bull riders at different points in their careers\u2014to find out what it\u2019s like as a person of color trying to make it in the predominantly white world of professional bull riding. Holmes\u2014an accomplished pro on the eve of his retirement\u2014explains how he got into bull riding, and talks about leaving the sport as the only black pro ranked in the top 100 bull riders. Desperately trying to fill Holmes's shoes is Mitchell, who's struggled with the funds to travel, and has experienced racism in the sport first-hand.  \n\nWe look into why one of the most popular sports in America has so few professional black athletes at its highest levels, and explore some of the barriers to entry that have made black representation difficult in the sport.\n\nWatch more episodes of 'MINORITY REPORTS' \u2014 https://vice.video/2LcuKdJ\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0",

                    "description": "In the heyday of America's Old West, roughly a fourth of the cowboys were black. But today, the world of professional bull riding, a sport rooted in ranching culture, is predominantly white.\n\nOn this episode of 'MINORITY REPORTS,' VICE sent Lee Adams to Texas to meet Neil Holmes and Ezekiel Mitchell\u2014two black bull riders at different points in their careers\u2014to find out what it\u2019s like as a person of color trying to make it in the predominantly white world of professional bull riding. Holmes\u2014an accomplished pro on the eve of his retirement\u2014explains how he got into bull riding, and talks about leaving the sport as the only black pro ranked in the top 100 bull riders. Desperately trying to fill Holmes's shoes is Mitchell, who's struggled with the funds to travel, and has experienced racism in the sport first-hand.  \n\nWe look into why one of the most popular sports in America has so few professional black athletes at its highest levels, and explore some of the barriers to entry that have made black representation difficult in the sport.\n\nWatch more episodes of 'MINORITY REPORTS' \u2014 https://vice.video/2LcuKdJ\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0"

On seven non-league grounds across London over ten days, sixteen teams including Tuvalu, Matabeleland, Tibet and Barawa compete for a rare chance at glory.\n\nWith 47 members around the world representing over 334 million people, CONIFA celebrates the teams who can\u2019t or don\u2019t qualify for FIFA membership, and gives under-recognised countries a unique opportunity to take part in a World Cup.\n\nIn the tournament, every team has a story, every nation or region has a reason to be there, and every one of them has felt ignored or under-represented before.

With a virtually unlimited amount of money to be made scamming, some tech-savvy criminals have turned ripping off credit card numbers into a full-time gig. \n\nVICE met up with a scammer for an inside look at the shady underground profession.

Over the past few years other clubs have popped up across the country with similar missions - if you\u2019re going to attend an anti-fascist demonstration, make sure you know how to protect yourself and others if confronted. \n\nSince the Brexit vote in 2016 there has been a dramatic rise in hate crime incidents and far-right terrorism, making the training taking place at Left Hook all the more necessary for those willing to stand against racism.  \n\nPracticing a mix of boxing, Muay Thai and MMA techniques, Vice travelled down to Brighton to see the training firsthand and hear from those taking part.\n\nWATCH NEXT: Inside America\u2019s Largest Right Wing Militia - http://bit.ly/2glqlan\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0",

Over the past few years other clubs have popped up across the country with similar missions - if you\u2019re going to attend an anti-fascist demonstration, make sure you know how to protect yourself and others if confronted. \n\nSince the Brexit vote in 2016 there has been a dramatic rise in hate crime incidents and far-right terrorism, making the training taking place at Left Hook all the more necessary for those willing to stand against racism.  \n\nPracticing a mix of boxing, Muay Thai and MMA techniques, Vice travelled down to Brighton to see the training firsthand and hear from those taking part.\n\nWATCH NEXT: Inside America\u2019s Largest Right Wing Militia - http://bit.ly/2glqlan\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0"

Among them are up to 3,000 unaccompanied children aged 12 to 17 who have traveled alone from countries like Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Pakistan. With insufficient accommodation, almost half of the young unaccompanied refugees in Greece have fallen outside of the system, many ending up on the streets where they are exposed to all sorts of dangers, including sexual exploitation and abuse.\n\nWe meet two boys, aged 15 and 16 who were coerced into prostitution in exchange for food and a few euros.

VICE met up with a few Antifa activists in Philadelphia who engage in \u201cBlack Bloc\u201d actions to find out more about their ideology, tactics, and individual reasons for participating in a high-risk form of activism.\n\nWATCH NEXT: Inside America\u2019s Largest Right Wing Militia - http://bit.ly/2glqlan\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0"

Still in a state of emergency, with troops patrolling the streets and more than 17,000 suspected terrorists to monitor, France\u2019s security services are more stretched than ever, and its civilian population on edge.\n\nNow a French entrepreneur living in Poland is offering what he calls \u201canti-jihadist training\u201d in Poland, a country lionized by Europe\u2019s new radical right for its uncompromising attitude to Muslim immigration and rejection of Western European liberalism. Videos on Hussard\u2019s website show camouflaged figures training in woodland with automatic weapons- is this legitimate self-defence training against a potential jihadist attack, or is it the beginning of a worrying slide towards militia training and civil conflict in France?\n\nVICE went to Warsaw to meet Gr\u00e9gory Leroy, founder of Hussard, to find out what the anti-jihadist training involves, why he\u2019s doing it, and what kind of people attend.\n\nWATCH NEXT: \u201cVICE News Tonight\u201d provides viewers with exclusive, up close and personal access inside the unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia - http://bit.ly/2iakloI\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0",

                    "description": "After the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the Paris attacks, the Nice attack, and a constant drumbeat of smaller lethal jihadist terror attacks, France is a country on edge. Still in a state of emergency, with troops patrolling the streets and more than 17,000 suspected terrorists to monitor, France\u2019s security services are more stretched than ever, and its civilian population on edge.\n\nNow a French entrepreneur living in Poland is offering what he calls \u201canti-jihadist training\u201d in Poland, a country lionized by Europe\u2019s new radical right for its uncompromising attitude to Muslim immigration and rejection of Western European liberalism. Videos on Hussard\u2019s website show camouflaged figures training in woodland with automatic weapons- is this legitimate self-defence training against a potential jihadist attack, or is it the beginning of a worrying slide towards militia training and civil conflict in France?\n\nVICE went to Warsaw to meet Gr\u00e9gory Leroy, founder of Hussard, to find out what the anti-jihadist training involves, why he\u2019s doing it, and what kind of people attend.\n\nWATCH NEXT: \u201cVICE News Tonight\u201d provides viewers with exclusive, up close and personal access inside the unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia - http://bit.ly/2iakloI\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0"

In 2016, Utah became the first State to officially declare porn a public health crisis, claiming porn has \u201cdetrimental\u201d effect on brain function, contributes to \u201cemotional and medical illnesses,\u201d and gives rise to \u201cdeviant sexual arousal.\u201d But with the science being murky at best, is this just Mormon morality infiltrating Utah legislation? \n\nPorn is obviously a polarizing topic. The LDS Church (\"Mormons\") perpetuate the belief that porn addiction is a \u201cplague like we have never seen,\u201d however, the psychiatric community does not even recognize porn as a clinical diagnosis. So, is porn actually contaminating our brains, or is this symbolic porn ban just a way of shaming Utah residents for their sexual desires? Having sprung out of this repression, the pornography site MormonGirlz.com, founded by a lapsed mormon, directly plays on LDS inspired sexual oppression for the sake of titillation - illustrating the ultimate backlash against suppressed sexual desires. \n\nIn this episode of Slutever, Karley travels to Utah to investigate the state's complicated, illicit and shamefully sexy world of porn. Karley speaks to members of Mormon church and other porn-haters at Utah\u2019s annual anti-porn convention, and spends some quality time with erotically-liberated resistance.\n\nWatch more Slutever: http://bit.ly/2fg5g2o\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0",

Isobel Yeung traces the path of these super-crops from the headquarters of American agribusiness titan Monsanto to the soy fields of Paraguay, and visits the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, high in the Arctic, to see what's truly at stake when humans try to improve on nature.\n\nThen: India is the largest democracy on Earth, with an advanced economy, a highly educated population, and cutting-edge space and nuclear weapons programs. But like many countries around the world, India hasn't been able to provide adequate clean water and sanitation systems for its growing population. Open defecation is widespread, and about 80 percent of sewage in India's cities flows directly into vital waterways like the Ganges. Tania Rashid goes to India to see just how bad the problem is, and why water is such a pressing issue around the world.\n\nVICE returns on Friday, February 5 at 11PM, exclusively on HBO\n\nWatch Season 1: http://bit.ly/1HyVviK\nWatch Season 2: http://bit.ly/1LBL8y6\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag",

                    "description": "Genetically modified seeds have been planted around the world and hailed as a solution to global hunger\u2014but these crops, called GMOs for \"genetically modified organisms,\" have also sparked heated protest around the world. Isobel Yeung traces the path of these super-crops from the headquarters of American agribusiness titan Monsanto to the soy fields of Paraguay, and visits the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, high in the Arctic, to see what's truly at stake when humans try to improve on nature.\n\nThen: India is the largest democracy on Earth, with an advanced economy, a highly educated population, and cutting-edge space and nuclear weapons programs. But like many countries around the world, India hasn't been able to provide adequate clean water and sanitation systems for its growing population. Open defecation is widespread, and about 80 percent of sewage in India's cities flows directly into vital waterways like the Ganges. Tania Rashid goes to India to see just how bad the problem is, and why water is such a pressing issue around the world.\n\nVICE returns on Friday, February 5 at 11PM, exclusively on HBO\n\nWatch Season 1: http://bit.ly/1HyVviK\nWatch Season 2: http://bit.ly/1LBL8y6\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag"

                "description": "These days, there's a fetish for pretty much everything. If you can imagine it, there's a corner of the internet where it's a thing. One fetish gaining traction is \"financial domination\"\u2014an extreme form of submission based on the pain of giving away thousands of dollars, only to be told you're a piece of shit by some domme you'll likely never meet and won't ever have sex with.\n\nIn our money-centric society, finding sexual pleasure by giving away your money seems like the ultimate dystopian fetish. But for the cash slaves who get off on financial domination, losing money is a real turn-on.\n\nIn this episode of Love Industries, we step into the world of financial domination to understand its growing allure.\n\nSpecial thanks to the FinDoms who provided archival material for this piece: Lara Kane, Goddess Lola Lux, Princess Jersey, Princess Kelly Sunshine, Princess Rene, Cherry Torn, and Mix Trix Fix.\n\nWATCH NEXT: The Mobile Love Industry - http://bit.ly/1GtebGg\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag",

                    "description": "These days, there's a fetish for pretty much everything. If you can imagine it, there's a corner of the internet where it's a thing. One fetish gaining traction is \"financial domination\"\u2014an extreme form of submission based on the pain of giving away thousands of dollars, only to be told you're a piece of shit by some domme you'll likely never meet and won't ever have sex with.\n\nIn our money-centric society, finding sexual pleasure by giving away your money seems like the ultimate dystopian fetish. But for the cash slaves who get off on financial domination, losing money is a real turn-on.\n\nIn this episode of Love Industries, we step into the world of financial domination to understand its growing allure.\n\nSpecial thanks to the FinDoms who provided archival material for this piece: Lara Kane, Goddess Lola Lux, Princess Jersey, Princess Kelly Sunshine, Princess Rene, Cherry Torn, and Mix Trix Fix.\n\nWATCH NEXT: The Mobile Love Industry - http://bit.ly/1GtebGg\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag"

He said the men's stories and the mistakes they made were not dissimilar to those the president made in his own youth, when he admittedly smoked pot and used cocaine.\n\nAmerica needs to distinguish between violent criminals and people \"doing stupid things,\" Obama said, adding that many young people who end up in prison for nonviolent drug crimes grew up in environments where drug trafficking is prevalent. Giving those people decades-long sentences is what is contributing to the country's overcrowded prison system, and more resources should be directed to education, support, and rehabilitation, he said. \n\n\"I am really interested in the possibilities, the prospect of bipartisan legislation around the criminal justice system,\" the president told reporters on June 30. \"And we've seen some really interesting leadership from some unlikely Republican legislators very sincerely concerned about making progress there.\"\n\nThe special is the latest in VICE's ongoing coverage of what has become a major civil rights and reform issue in the United States.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag",

                "description": "Wim Hof first caught the attention of scientists when he proved he was able to use meditation to stay submerged in ice for 1 hour and 53 minutes without his core body temperature changing. Since then, he\u2019s climbed Mount Everest in his shorts, resisted altitude sickness, completed a marathon in the Namib Desert with no water and proven under a laboratory setting that he\u2019s able to influence his autonomic nervous system and immune system at will.\n\nAlmost everything Wim has done was previously thought to be impossible - but he\u2019s not a freak of nature.\n\nTo demonstrate that any human can learn his methods, Wim offered to teach Matt Shea and Daisy-May Hudson to climb a freezing cold mountain in their shorts without getting cold. But when Matt and Daisy signed up for the training, they had no idea that the so-called Iceman was planning to lead them on a psychedelic journey across Europe that circled the chasm between science, spirituality and mystery.\n\nSally Donatello - Photographer \n\nWatch Next: The Giants of Iceland - http://bit.ly/1fJjOUL\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag",

                    "description": "Wim Hof first caught the attention of scientists when he proved he was able to use meditation to stay submerged in ice for 1 hour and 53 minutes without his core body temperature changing. Since then, he\u2019s climbed Mount Everest in his shorts, resisted altitude sickness, completed a marathon in the Namib Desert with no water and proven under a laboratory setting that he\u2019s able to influence his autonomic nervous system and immune system at will.\n\nAlmost everything Wim has done was previously thought to be impossible - but he\u2019s not a freak of nature.\n\nTo demonstrate that any human can learn his methods, Wim offered to teach Matt Shea and Daisy-May Hudson to climb a freezing cold mountain in their shorts without getting cold. But when Matt and Daisy signed up for the training, they had no idea that the so-called Iceman was planning to lead them on a psychedelic journey across Europe that circled the chasm between science, spirituality and mystery.\n\nSally Donatello - Photographer \n\nWatch Next: The Giants of Iceland - http://bit.ly/1fJjOUL\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag"

While big fishing operations continue to prosper as they go deeper into the ocean, small-scale coastal fishermen continue to seek out new fishing practices to survive. Some have even gone so far as to use such rudimentary practices as dynamite fishing to catch a few fish while wreaking havoc on the ecosystem.\n\nWatch VICE Fridays at on HBO at 11PM, 10PM Central.\n\nWatch Season 1: http://bit.ly/VICE-HBO-S1\nWatch Season 2: http://bit.ly/VICE-HBO-S2-E1\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice",

If the situation stays as it is, South Koreans are predicted to become extinct by 2750.

If the situation stays as it is, South Koreans are predicted to become extinct by 2750. Because of the rapidly aging population, elderly prostitutes known as \"Bacchus ladies\" have cornered a number of public parks as their working areas. Meanwhile, South Korean kids are living with their families well into their 20s\u2014as a result, an entire economy of sex motels has sprung up to give kids a place to fool around outside the watchful eyes of their parents.\n\nWe sent Matt Shea to investigate this generational crisis, which led him to Seoul's red-light district, a pre-wedding photo shoot on the set of a Korean soap opera, and an erotic sculpture park on South Korea's \"honeymoon island.\"\n\nMore from VICE:\nThe Japanese Love Industry - http://bit.ly/Japanese-Love-Industry\nThe Digital Love Industry - http://bit.ly/Digital-Love-Industries\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice"

Martin Starr from Silicon Valley plays the titular motion-challenged character who, despite every attempt to be a normal office drone, can't seem to stay up to speed.\n\nWhile Leonard's slow-motion should be classified by today's workplace standards as a disability, it's treated more like a novelty or a clown show. His boss even blackmails Leonard into performing tricks at his kid's birthday party.\n\nIt's tough being Leonard. A bathroom break now lasts 20 minutes, and that doesn't include wiping or washing. He redefines the term \"slow eater.\" And what's sex like if you can never go faster than \"super slow\"?\n\nLivolsi plays beautifully with the tribulations of Leonard's life, whether it's getting to work on time or literally being too slow to get the girl. It's a fantastic tale of personal redemption that also happens to include one of the best vomit scenes in all of film. \n\nRead an interview with the director here: http://bit.ly/1zYX76M\n\nWatch more VICE Shorts here: http://bit.ly/VICE_Shorts\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice",

The protagonist, Kenny Powers, is an obnoxious, crass Southerner who has fallen from grace after his professional baseball career has abruptly ended. But who was the inspiration for the character? \n\nAt the height of his career, John Rocker was one of the best closers in professional baseball, and also one of the most disliked people in the game. In 1999, comments he made that were printed in Sports Illustrated came to represent the worst of American culture: racist, homophobic, and xenophobic. He apologized for the remarks later, but Rocker's crass and confrontational nature never died, and there's something kind of lovable and funny about the guy; after all, he's just a baseball player. Or maybe not? This is the real Kenny Powers.\n\nWatch The Real 'True Detective'? - http://bit.ly/Real-True-Detective\n\nCheck out more episodes of The Real: http://bit.ly/The-Real\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice",

Launched in 2014, MUNCHIES offers groundbreaking content from a youth driven perspective. In today's modern world, the formerly tangible pleasures of music, film, and emerging media are just one click away. Food and the events that manifest around it are one of the everlasting experiences that cannot be replicated by arcs and zeroes. MUNCHIES chronicles the wide spectrum of the global culinary experience and the diverse voices that are pulling us forward: chefs and home cooks, makers and consumers, the politics and policies of food, \"front\" and \"back of house\" restaurant life, old wives tales and innovative news, and culturally significant indicators in our modern world. Through engaging original video content, compelling editorial features, articles, how-tos, recipes and events, MUNCHIES offers a signature perspective on the intersection where humans and food connect.\n\nCheck out http://munchies.tv for more!\n\nFollow Munchies here:\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/munchies\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/munchies\nTumblr: http://munchies.tumblr.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/munchiesvice",

Launched in 2014, MUNCHIES offers groundbreaking content from a youth driven perspective. In today's modern world, the formerly tangible pleasures of music, film, and emerging media are just one click away. Food and the events that manifest around it are one of the everlasting experiences that cannot be replicated by arcs and zeroes. MUNCHIES chronicles the wide spectrum of the global culinary experience and the diverse voices that are pulling us forward: chefs and home cooks, makers and consumers, the politics and policies of food, \"front\" and \"back of house\" restaurant life, old wives tales and innovative news, and culturally significant indicators in our modern world. Through engaging original video content, compelling editorial features, articles, how-tos, recipes and events, MUNCHIES offers a signature perspective on the intersection where humans and food connect.\n\nCheck out http://munchies.tv for more!\n\nFollow Munchies here:\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/munchies\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/munchies\nTumblr: http://munchies.tumblr.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/munchiesvice"

Over the years, his Bobby Bird character developed the way any icon might\u2014through critically acclaimed, multi-platform releases. First, was the Sundance selected short film The Devil In Denim, a slow-boiled, talky-doc about Bird's tattoos and the stories behind them. The short set up Bobby's darkly cynical and slang-spinning speaking style, which came to define the character and humor in the more narrative 2008 Sundance short film Chonto. After a quick recap of Bobby's failed sexual singles, he got to the line that lit up his career again, \"You can't untell a tale, you can't outslow a snail.\" Like that we're thrust into an absurd, rambling, and drug-fueled recollection of Bobby Bird's craziest music tour when he adopts a transvestite monkey from some remote zoo/religious theme park in South America, proceeds to raise him as his own child, and fucks a whole bunch of shit up in his wake.\n\nThe film expands Bird's universe as an exaggerated amalgamation of every rock icon of the last 50 years, yet brings the heartache and humor home through a remarkably touching tale of love and friendship shared between Bobby and Chonto. Carson's careful reading of Bobby and the sloppy and slow-moving imagery give the story a weight that probably wouldn't translate in a live-action version. More than an animated movie, Chonto is an illustrated story, and with unique dialogue coming out of interesting characters you don't need expensive, snazzy effects. In fact, the homegrown aspects of the film, from the simple illustrations to the superimposed human mouths to all of the characters sounding the same, enhance the idea that this is one man's story. In a way, it makes the fake film strangely more autobiographical since only one man does it all.\n\nWatch more VICE Shorts here: http://bit.ly/VICE-Shorts\n\nSubscribe to VICE here! http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com",

Over the years, his Bobby Bird character developed the way any icon might\u2014through critically acclaimed, multi-platform releases. First, was the Sundance selected short film The Devil In Denim, a slow-boiled, talky-doc about Bird's tattoos and the stories behind them. The short set up Bobby's darkly cynical and slang-spinning speaking style, which came to define the character and humor in the more narrative 2008 Sundance short film Chonto. After a quick recap of Bobby's failed sexual singles, he got to the line that lit up his career again, \"You can't untell a tale, you can't outslow a snail.\" Like that we're thrust into an absurd, rambling, and drug-fueled recollection of Bobby Bird's craziest music tour when he adopts a transvestite monkey from some remote zoo/religious theme park in South America, proceeds to raise him as his own child, and fucks a whole bunch of shit up in his wake.\n\nThe film expands Bird's universe as an exaggerated amalgamation of every rock icon of the last 50 years, yet brings the heartache and humor home through a remarkably touching tale of love and friendship shared between Bobby and Chonto. Carson's careful reading of Bobby and the sloppy and slow-moving imagery give the story a weight that probably wouldn't translate in a live-action version. More than an animated movie, Chonto is an illustrated story, and with unique dialogue coming out of interesting characters you don't need expensive, snazzy effects. In fact, the homegrown aspects of the film, from the simple illustrations to the superimposed human mouths to all of the characters sounding the same, enhance the idea that this is one man's story. In a way, it makes the fake film strangely more autobiographical since only one man does it all.\n\nWatch more VICE Shorts here: http://bit.ly/VICE-Shorts\n\nSubscribe to VICE here! http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com"

The \"most dangerous philosopher in the West\" talks about his new film, The Pervert's Guide to Ideology, and lectures us on the importance of being on time. If you're curious about that poster of Stalin on his wall, it's \"purely to annoy idiots\" when they visit.\n\nCheck out the Best of VICE here: http://bit.ly/VICE-Best-Of\n\nSubscribe to VICE here! http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vic\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com"

                "description": "In 1936, a family of Russian Old Believers journeyed deep into Siberia's vast taiga to escape persecution and protect their way of life. The Lykovs eventually settled in the Sayan Mountains, 160 miles from any other sign of civilization. In 1944, Agafia Lykov was born into this wilderness. Today, she is the last surviving Lykov, remaining steadfast in her seclusion. In this episode of Far Out, the VICE crew travels to Agafia to learn about her taiga lifestyle and the encroaching influence of the outside world.\n\nThe outside world has crept into Agafia's life in a number of ways. Media attention, news and falling rocket debris have altered her perception of herself and the society she remains outside of, but overall Agafia's daily-to-day hasn't changed much. She maintains an almost childlike optimism that's made most evident through the smile she almost always has on her face.\n\nWatch the rest here:\nhttp://bit.ly/Far-Out-Siberia-1\nhttp://bit.ly/Far-Out-Siberia-3\nhttp://bit.ly/Far-Out-Siberia-4\n\nCheck out the Best of VICE here: http://bit.ly/VICE-Best-Of\n\nSubscribe to VICE here! http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com",

                    "description": "In 1936, a family of Russian Old Believers journeyed deep into Siberia's vast taiga to escape persecution and protect their way of life. The Lykovs eventually settled in the Sayan Mountains, 160 miles from any other sign of civilization. In 1944, Agafia Lykov was born into this wilderness. Today, she is the last surviving Lykov, remaining steadfast in her seclusion. In this episode of Far Out, the VICE crew travels to Agafia to learn about her taiga lifestyle and the encroaching influence of the outside world.\n\nThe outside world has crept into Agafia's life in a number of ways. Media attention, news and falling rocket debris have altered her perception of herself and the society she remains outside of, but overall Agafia's daily-to-day hasn't changed much. She maintains an almost childlike optimism that's made most evident through the smile she almost always has on her face.\n\nWatch the rest here:\nhttp://bit.ly/Far-Out-Siberia-1\nhttp://bit.ly/Far-Out-Siberia-3\nhttp://bit.ly/Far-Out-Siberia-4\n\nCheck out the Best of VICE here: http://bit.ly/VICE-Best-Of\n\nSubscribe to VICE here! http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com"

He loves movies. It's rumored that he has one of the largest private film collections in the world. His favorite film is Gone with the Wind and his favorite actress is Elizabeth Taylor. He's a film collector and bona fide cinephile, but he's much more. He's everything really. He's a director, a producer, a financier, a costume maker, set designer, screenwriter, cameraman, sound engineer... and he's also a film theorist. His masterwork on aesthetics and practice is \"On the Art of Cinema\" (written and published in the early 1970s). In it he gives himself the humble title, \"Genius of the Cinema.\" He built an extensive film studio in Pyongyang and when he couldn't find someone to make his film he did what any self-respecting eternal leader and great president would do... he kidnapped one.\n\nMore from Shane Smith: http://www.vice.com/author/shane-smith\nFollow Shane on Twitter: https://twitter.com/shanesmith30\n\nOriginally aired in 2011 on http://VICE.com\n\nCheck out more VICE documentaries here: http://bit.ly/VICE-Documentaries \n\nSubscribe for videos that are actually good: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://www.youtube.com/user/vice/videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com",

                    "description": "We went to North Korea to try and penetrate the Korean Feature Film Studio, the state-run film production facility west of Pyongyang: a sprawling lot that at its height produced around 40 films a year.\n\nWatch the rest here!\nhttp://bit.ly/North-Korean-Film-2\nhttp://bit.ly/North-Korean-Film-3\n\nYou could say that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il has two primary obsessions: maintaining nuclear weapons capability as a means of protecting his \"hermit kingdom,\" and thwarting pressure from outside forces like America and the rest of the industrialized world to open his country to modern things like electricity... and he's obsessed with film. He loves movies. It's rumored that he has one of the largest private film collections in the world. His favorite film is Gone with the Wind and his favorite actress is Elizabeth Taylor. He's a film collector and bona fide cinephile, but he's much more. He's everything really. He's a director, a producer, a financier, a costume maker, set designer, screenwriter, cameraman, sound engineer... and he's also a film theorist. His masterwork on aesthetics and practice is \"On the Art of Cinema\" (written and published in the early 1970s). In it he gives himself the humble title, \"Genius of the Cinema.\" He built an extensive film studio in Pyongyang and when he couldn't find someone to make his film he did what any self-respecting eternal leader and great president would do... he kidnapped one.\n\nMore from Shane Smith: http://www.vice.com/author/shane-smith\nFollow Shane on Twitter: https://twitter.com/shanesmith30\n\nOriginally aired in 2011 on http://VICE.com\n\nCheck out more VICE documentaries here: http://bit.ly/VICE-Documentaries \n\nSubscribe for videos that are actually good: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://www.youtube.com/user/vice/videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com"

Local sex worker Anitha invites us for lunch in her brothel; shows us her homemade \"sex rooms,\" and tells us what it's like to be a religious prostitute in modern India. \n\nAfterwards we cross the border into Karnataka into the heartlands of the ancient Devadasi tradition to uncover the mystery of the Goddess Yellamma, and find out how a religious icon became a justification for child prostitution. We meet two teenage Devadasis, Mala and Belavva, to talk sex, saris, and how they cope with the deadly threat of HIV.\n\nA dancing transvestite Devadasi steals the limelight in the next phase of our journey, as we travel deeper into the murky world of temple prostitution. He invites us for chai, gives our host a manicure, and teaches us a few tricks of the trade. We explore the home of the most celebrated Devadasi brothel madam in the business to find out how she lures the next generation of girls into the sex trade.\n\nFor the grand finale we went to the annual full moon festival in Saundatti, the most prestigious event in the Devadasi calendar. The colour, dancing and celebrations of the festival disguise the darkness of its underlying purpose: child sex trafficking. Here traffickers, pimps and brothel madams come from all over India to recruit young girls and boys into the sex trade in the name of the Goddess Yellamma. On our way home, we are invited to a remote mud hut to meet two older Devadasi women a mother and daughter who reflect back on their lives and ask the question: what kind of religion turns parents into pimps and their children into prostitutes?\n\nSubscribe for videos that are actually good: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://www.youtube.com/user/vice/videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com",

Local sex worker Anitha invites us for lunch in her brothel; shows us her homemade \"sex rooms,\" and tells us what it's like to be a religious prostitute in modern India. \n\nAfterwards we cross the border into Karnataka into the heartlands of the ancient Devadasi tradition to uncover the mystery of the Goddess Yellamma, and find out how a religious icon became a justification for child prostitution. We meet two teenage Devadasis, Mala and Belavva, to talk sex, saris, and how they cope with the deadly threat of HIV.\n\nA dancing transvestite Devadasi steals the limelight in the next phase of our journey, as we travel deeper into the murky world of temple prostitution. He invites us for chai, gives our host a manicure, and teaches us a few tricks of the trade. We explore the home of the most celebrated Devadasi brothel madam in the business to find out how she lures the next generation of girls into the sex trade.\n\nFor the grand finale we went to the annual full moon festival in Saundatti, the most prestigious event in the Devadasi calendar. The colour, dancing and celebrations of the festival disguise the darkness of its underlying purpose: child sex trafficking. Here traffickers, pimps and brothel madams come from all over India to recruit young girls and boys into the sex trade in the name of the Goddess Yellamma. On our way home, we are invited to a remote mud hut to meet two older Devadasi women a mother and daughter who reflect back on their lives and ask the question: what kind of religion turns parents into pimps and their children into prostitutes?\n\nSubscribe for videos that are actually good: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://www.youtube.com/user/vice/videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com"

She spent three years of her life running from the DEA, being held partially against her will and used as a guinea pig for strange new psychedelic chemicals. Eventually, her friends-turned-captors were arrested and Krystle herself barely escaped incarceration. She now makes her living as a writer, sharing her experiences in books and on the web.\n \nWatch the VICE feature on Fentanyl: The Drug Deadlier than Heroin: http://bit.ly/2aB2Ead\n \nFor more episodes of Hamilton's Pharmacopeia, click here: http://bit.ly/1p4lfu9\n \nCheck out Krystle's channel here: http://www.youtube.com/user/NeuroSoup\n \nWatch more VICE documentaries here: http://bit.ly/VICE-Documentaries\n \nSubscribe for videos that are actually good: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://www.youtube.com/user/vice/videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\""
