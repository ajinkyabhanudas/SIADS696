                "description": "The UK has recorded record temperatures above 40C for the first time, heightening concern over the impact of global climate change.\n\nThermometers hit 40.3C at Coningsby in Lincolnshire while dozens of other locations exceeded the UK\u2019s previous highest recorded temperature of 38.7C. \n\nFire services declared major incidents after a spate of blazes.   Some rail services were cancelled after tracks overheated or buckled and overhead cables failed.\n\nThe Met Office chief of science and technology Prof Stephen Belcher said exceeding 40C in the UK was  \"virtually impossible\" in an undisrupted climate.   However global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions meant extreme temperatures had become common. \n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the start of the industrial era and climate scientists say that temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n\nSophie Raworth presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Justin Rowlatt and Daniel Sandford.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews",

                    "description": "The UK has recorded record temperatures above 40C for the first time, heightening concern over the impact of global climate change.\n\nThermometers hit 40.3C at Coningsby in Lincolnshire while dozens of other locations exceeded the UK\u2019s previous highest recorded temperature of 38.7C. \n\nFire services declared major incidents after a spate of blazes.   Some rail services were cancelled after tracks overheated or buckled and overhead cables failed.\n\nThe Met Office chief of science and technology Prof Stephen Belcher said exceeding 40C in the UK was  \"virtually impossible\" in an undisrupted climate.   However global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions meant extreme temperatures had become common. \n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the start of the industrial era and climate scientists say that temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n\nSophie Raworth presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Justin Rowlatt and Daniel Sandford.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews"

It is the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades and a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed.\n\nThe earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. \n\nHuw Edwards presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Secunder Kermani in Afghanistan and world affairs correspondent Caroline Hawley.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews"

Mourners and pallbearers were beaten with batons, stun grenades were fired and at one point the casket was almost dropped to the ground. \n\nThe United States was among countries and organisations that condemned the actions of Israel\u2019s security forces.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Tom Bateman in Jerusalem.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews"

They were followed by the chief of staff Dan Rosenfield and senior civil servant Martin Reynolds.\n\nThe resignations come as Mr Johnson faces increasing questions over his leadership from within his party.\n\nMs Mirza quit over the Prime Minister\u2019s false claim in Parliament that Sir Keir Starmer, when he was director of public prosecutions,  had been responsible for failing to prosecute the paedophile Jimmy Savile .\n\nThe Chancellor Rishi Sunak has also publicly distanced himself from Boris Johnson\u2019s claim. \n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by political editor Laura Kuenssberg.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews"

That however still leaves hundreds of millions at risk and doctors have warned that if an Omicron-fuelled third wave hits, medical facilities could still be overrun very quickly.\n\n\"We are just starting to see an uptick in the number of patients... these are double vaccinated people starting to get infection again,\" says Dr Sumit Ray, from Holy Family Hospital in Delhi.\n\nWarning: This report contains distressing images.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#India #BBCNews",

That however still leaves hundreds of millions at risk and doctors have warned that if an Omicron-fuelled third wave hits, medical facilities could still be overrun very quickly.\n\n\"We are just starting to see an uptick in the number of patients... these are double vaccinated people starting to get infection again,\" says Dr Sumit Ray, from Holy Family Hospital in Delhi.\n\nWarning: This report contains distressing images.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#India #BBCNews"

All they want, he said, is a display image for Facebook or Instagram.\n\nVideo by Anshul Verma\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#India #BBCNews"

But the British government is facing fierce criticism from many UK MPs over the withdrawal of western troops that led to the Taliban's seizure of power.  \n\nMany of those Afghans who want to leave  worked alongside coalition forces and diplomatic staff in the 20 years since the invasion following the 9/11 terror attacks. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Secunder Kermani in Kabul,  Lucy Manning and political correspondent Ben Wright.Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews",

                    "description": "Taliban fighters are reported to have opened fire on crowds and shot dead protesters in Afghanistan who were demonstrating against their takeover of the country. \n\nThere have been more desperate scenes outside the international airport in Kabul, as thousands of Afghans try to flee the country.\n\nIn response to the developing humanitarian crisis the UK announced that it will take 20,000 Afghan refugees over a number of years. But the British government is facing fierce criticism from many UK MPs over the withdrawal of western troops that led to the Taliban's seizure of power.  \n\nMany of those Afghans who want to leave  worked alongside coalition forces and diplomatic staff in the 20 years since the invasion following the 9/11 terror attacks. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Secunder Kermani in Kabul,  Lucy Manning and political correspondent Ben Wright.Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews"

                    "description": "The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, occupying the capital Kabul after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.\n\nTaliban forces occupied the Presidential Palace, from where they are preparing to announce that they are the new rulers of an \u201cIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s the culmination of a lightning takeover by the Islamist fighters, following the decision by the United States and other coalition nations to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan.   \n\nCoalition troops first entered the country in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks and removed the Taliban from power.   20 years of fighting to support the new Afghan government cost thousands of lives. \n\nThe decision of the US President Joe Biden to withdraw all US forces by September paved the way for the final Taliban offensive that overwhelmed the Afghan government's forces.\n\nForeign nationals and many Afghans have been trying to get on flights out of Kabul airport, where US and British troops have been deployed to aid the evacuation. \n\nMishal Husain presents BBC News at Ten reporting by diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams, Malik Mudassir in Kabul, political correspondent Ben Wright and north America editor Jon Sopel. \n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews"

He won it alongside colleague Adnan Abidi and five others for their work documenting the violence faced by Myanmar's minority Rohingya community.\n\nRecently, his photos of mass funerals held at the peak of India's devastating second Covid wave went viral and won him global praise and recognition.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews"

The government tried to crush the protests and the country descended into civil war.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that more than 250,000 people have died in the conflict although the true number could be much higher.\n\nAt least 6.2 million Syrians have been forced from their homes and  5.7 million have left the country.\n\nA decade on, after all the bloodshed, President Bashar al-Assad is still in power.\n\nIn 2013 in Aleppo Iqra school was bombed by a fighter jet. Some children were killed instantly while others died of their injuries in the days and weeks that followed. A BBC Panorama team were filming nearby when the attack happened. \n\nHuw Edwards presents BBC News at Ten reporting by cameraman Darren Conway who has returned to Aleppo, to meet survivors and relatives. \n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#BBCNews"

Among measures being considered to restart the economy are the reopening of schools and public transport.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg. \n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog"
