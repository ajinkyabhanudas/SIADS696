Tatiana was the mastermind behind the two of them starting to make TikToks together; one video of them both singing to a popular pop song received over 700,000 views and people couldn't seem to believe they were mother and daughter. Tatiana and Pandora received comments such as: \"Which one is the mum?\", \"omg you're twins\" and \"this is why I need a kid young\". However, not all of the comments were positive... Pandora told Truly: \"The comments that I don't like are when people say: 'You're just trying to be young when you're not'. I'm not trying to be young, I'm just being myself and doing something with my daughter.\" Tatiana has also had some online trolls commenting on her body type and has even been accused of photoshopping herself due to her slim figure. Despite the negative comments the pair have received, they love making TikToks together and have no plans to be stopping anytime soon.  \n\nFollow Tatiana here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tatianafs1/\n\nVideographer: Marcus Hessenberg\nProducers: Milly Martin, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Cecilia Brunelli\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Tatiana was the mastermind behind the two of them starting to make TikToks together; one video of them both singing to a popular pop song received over 700,000 views and people couldn't seem to believe they were mother and daughter. Tatiana and Pandora received comments such as: \"Which one is the mum?\", \"omg you're twins\" and \"this is why I need a kid young\". However, not all of the comments were positive... Pandora told Truly: \"The comments that I don't like are when people say: 'You're just trying to be young when you're not'. I'm not trying to be young, I'm just being myself and doing something with my daughter.\" Tatiana has also had some online trolls commenting on her body type and has even been accused of photoshopping herself due to her slim figure. Despite the negative comments the pair have received, they love making TikToks together and have no plans to be stopping anytime soon.  \n\nFollow Tatiana here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tatianafs1/\n\nVideographer: Marcus Hessenberg\nProducers: Milly Martin, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Cecilia Brunelli\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

John Larkins, aka Larko, is a rapper who was born with cerebral palsy, leaving him unable to walk or speak. He uses a device operated by eye gaze to communicate and write lyrics. His music has jetted him to multiple countries to perform, but he is taking a break after recently becoming engaged to his fianc\u00e9, Takhmina. The couple met while holidaying in Dubai and quickly fell in love. After getting engaged earlier this year, they are now planning for their big day. People have \"warned\" Larko that Takhmina is just after his money, but the couple isn't bothered by others' speculation.\n\n\nVideographer:  Abdulaziz Mavlyanov\nProducers: Dan Coles, Emilia Jiang & Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Reuben Yarwood\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nTHIS INTERABLED COUPLE claims their relationship is genuine despite what the haters say. John Larkins, aka Larko, is a rapper who was born with cerebral palsy, leaving him unable to walk or speak. He uses a device operated by eye gaze to communicate and write lyrics. His music has jetted him to multiple countries to perform, but he is taking a break after recently becoming engaged to his fianc\u00e9, Takhmina. The couple met while holidaying in Dubai and quickly fell in love. After getting engaged earlier this year, they are now planning for their big day. People have \"warned\" Larko that Takhmina is just after his money, but the couple isn't bothered by others' speculation.\n\n\nVideographer:  Abdulaziz Mavlyanov\nProducers: Dan Coles, Emilia Jiang & Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Reuben Yarwood\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

They met as swingers but couldn\u2019t get enough of each other. \u201cWhen we started talking we met that very next week, we just wanted to see more and more of each other,\u201d 27-year-old Taya told Truly. They never stopped talking and eventually Alysia, 33, and Sean, 45, admitted they had feelings for each other. Soon after Taya and Tyler, 35, said that they felt the same. The four now all live together in a beautiful spacious house in Oregon with horses in the back garden. The men swap bedrooms every night and share two children (an eight and seven-year-old) Alysia and Tyler had before, as they describe it, their 'closed quad' met. In 2021 Alysia and Taya each gave birth to a baby but they haven't found out which man is the biological father to either baby - and they don\u2019t want to know. Alysia said: \u201cSure I\u2019ve wondered about it but I see Sean as a wonderful daddy to the babies and I see Tyler as a wonderful daddy too.\u201d  \n\nFollow their story here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/polyfamory/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@polyfamory\n\nVideographer: Scot Ballard\nProducers: Bethan Kapur, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Helen McKee\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

They met as swingers but couldn\u2019t get enough of each other. \u201cWhen we started talking we met that very next week, we just wanted to see more and more of each other,\u201d 27-year-old Taya told Truly. They never stopped talking and eventually Alysia, 33, and Sean, 45, admitted they had feelings for each other. Soon after Taya and Tyler, 35, said that they felt the same. The four now all live together in a beautiful spacious house in Oregon with horses in the back garden. The men swap bedrooms every night and share two children (an eight and seven-year-old) Alysia and Tyler had before, as they describe it, their 'closed quad' met. In 2021 Alysia and Taya each gave birth to a baby but they haven't found out which man is the biological father to either baby - and they don\u2019t want to know. Alysia said: \u201cSure I\u2019ve wondered about it but I see Sean as a wonderful daddy to the babies and I see Tyler as a wonderful daddy too.\u201d  \n\nFollow their story here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/polyfamory/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@polyfamory\n\nVideographer: Scot Ballard\nProducers: Bethan Kapur, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Helen McKee\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

She lives a very extravagant life and has hit back at online trolls who hate her appearance and way of living. Tammy is a multiple business owner, from real estate, to OnlyFans and loves the expensive things in life.

The couple hit it off on their first date and have now been together for a few months. David was Willow's first and only Tinder date. She says it was an instant connection and they fell in love in one hour. David told Truly: \u201cIt was an unbelievable connection. I just fell like immediately.\" The couple became official after their date and have been inseparable ever since. They have been enjoying each other's time by travelling around the world together, dining at restaurants and attending events. David and Willow haven't shied away from sharing their relationship online but that has come with judgement. As well as being judged for their age difference, they have also received comments suggesting Willow is only after David's money. When Willow first met David she didn\u2019t want to be influenced by anything. She said: \u201cI didn't want to be influenced by anything outside. I just wanted to like know him as a person first\u2026Let me see if I like you like you too, before I let any outside factors, like make me feel any type of way.\" The couple choose to ignore the comments because they know what they have is real and continue to share their life and the fun things they get up to.\n\nFollow the couple on their socials here:\nTikTok:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@cowboy.and.angel?lang=en\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@willowbeeeeeee?lang=en\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kingandqueenofblackjack/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/willowwbarbie/?hl=en\nYouTube:\nhttps://youtube.com/channel/UCxhoB3DtlvcReL-hw3VSB7w\n\nVideographer: Adams Wood\nProducers:\u2002Alicia Bailey, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Vanessa Nascimento\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Getting stopped in the street and mistaken for the real Kate is a regular occurrence for Denise due to her being the spitting image of Mossy. Thanks to her likeness to Kate, Denise has carved out a successful career as a lookalike and has become something of a local celebrity in her hometown. When she reached her teens, strangers started to notice she was Kate\u2019s doppelganger. Denise told truly: \u201cWhen I got to about 16 I used to get scream at in the street, \u2018Oh my God there\u2019s Kate Moss\u2019 and I\u2019d have people shouting, \u2018can I be your agent!\u2019\u201d As she grew up Denise began to look more and more like Kate, she told Truly: \u201cAs I got older I feel like I\u2019m morphing more and more into Kate but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s done purposefully. I almost feel like I look more like her when I\u2019ve got no makeup on, then you can just really see the features, it's not made up with anything.\u201d Truly visited Kate at home to find out what it\u2019s like to be a Kate Moss lookalike and have a peek at some of the Moss-inspired garments she has in her wardrobe.\n\nFollow Denise Here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/iamnotkatemoss/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@iamnotkatemoss\nhttps://www.instagram.com/doddywood/\n\nVideographer: Tim Brunsden\nProducers: Tom Jones, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Pete Ansell\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Getting stopped in the street and mistaken for the real Kate is a regular occurrence for Denise due to her being the spitting image of Mossy. Thanks to her likeness to Kate, Denise has carved out a successful career as a lookalike and has become something of a local celebrity in her hometown. When she reached her teens, strangers started to notice she was Kate\u2019s doppelganger. Denise told truly: \u201cWhen I got to about 16 I used to get scream at in the street, \u2018Oh my God there\u2019s Kate Moss\u2019 and I\u2019d have people shouting, \u2018can I be your agent!\u2019\u201d As she grew up Denise began to look more and more like Kate, she told Truly: \u201cAs I got older I feel like I\u2019m morphing more and more into Kate but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s done purposefully. I almost feel like I look more like her when I\u2019ve got no makeup on, then you can just really see the features, it's not made up with anything.\u201d Truly visited Kate at home to find out what it\u2019s like to be a Kate Moss lookalike and have a peek at some of the Moss-inspired garments she has in her wardrobe.\n\nFollow Denise Here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/iamnotkatemoss/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@iamnotkatemoss\nhttps://www.instagram.com/doddywood/\n\nVideographer: Tim Brunsden\nProducers: Tom Jones, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Pete Ansell\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Confused by what was happening, she was eventually diagnosed with PCOS - a condition that affects a woman\u2019s hormone levels. One of the symptoms includes hirsutism, which creates excessive hair growth on the face, chest and back. She told Truly: \u201cWhen it first started growing I felt confused and really embarrassed. I had really low confidence and self-esteem. I just wanted to hide.\u201d Desperate to hide her facial hair, Gennevieve would constantly wax and shave. She said: \u201cI avoided going out as much as humanly possible.\u201d Eventually, she realised she didn\u2019t want to hide anymore and started sharing photos of her beard on Instagram. \u201cThe reaction online was great. People were really supportive,\u201d Gennevieve explained. Today, we see Gennevieve going to get her beard trimmed for the first time - something that five years ago, she never could have imagined doing. \u201cI feel really proud of my beard. The advice that I want to give other women who have facial hair is that you are not alone. It is possible to learn to love it. I love my beard!\u201d\n\nFollow Gennevieve here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/beardedladyg/\n\nVideographer: Dennis Porter\nProducers: Kathryn Lewsey, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Josh Brown\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nGENNEVIEVE from Canada was 16 when she first started growing hair on her face. Confused by what was happening, she was eventually diagnosed with PCOS - a condition that affects a woman\u2019s hormone levels. One of the symptoms includes hirsutism, which creates excessive hair growth on the face, chest and back. She told Truly: \u201cWhen it first started growing I felt confused and really embarrassed. I had really low confidence and self-esteem. I just wanted to hide.\u201d Desperate to hide her facial hair, Gennevieve would constantly wax and shave. She said: \u201cI avoided going out as much as humanly possible.\u201d Eventually, she realised she didn\u2019t want to hide anymore and started sharing photos of her beard on Instagram. \u201cThe reaction online was great. People were really supportive,\u201d Gennevieve explained. Today, we see Gennevieve going to get her beard trimmed for the first time - something that five years ago, she never could have imagined doing. \u201cI feel really proud of my beard. The advice that I want to give other women who have facial hair is that you are not alone. It is possible to learn to love it. I love my beard!\u201d\n\nFollow Gennevieve here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/beardedladyg/\n\nVideographer: Dennis Porter\nProducers: Kathryn Lewsey, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Josh Brown\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

The family of 14, who are based in California, have always enjoyed dancing and performing together. But it wasn\u2019t until 2021 that mum, Iris, began sharing her family\u2019s talents on social media. Within months the family had gone viral.

Arthur admits he was always worried about finding love due to his 'plump size' but after meeting and marrying Luana he was inspired to drop nearly five stone and gained his confidence back. At this point, the married couple started introducing more partners to their now poly lifestyle. Since sharing their story with the world they have received negative judgment from every angle with people saying their lifestyle is \u201cdisgusting\u201d - but remain confident in their decision and choose to ignore the trolls and focus on their own happiness. Arthur said: \u201cTo remember their names for a while was difficult but not now. These days I fight for a cause and many admire the courage I have to confront society and live the life I always dreamt of. The main consequence of this lifestyle is being excluded from society, because it\u2019s hard to make friends, especially when you have this status and image. But we never cared for friendship. We always lived for each other, always. Since the beginning of the relationship we always thought that we don\u2019t need other people to be happy. That\u2019s why we never listened to other people, we chose to live the life we always wanted.\u201d\n\nFollow their story here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/arthurourso/?hl=en\n\nVideographer: Pedro Ladeira\nProducers: Marilia Marasciulo, Daniel Coles, Kim Nguyen \nEditor: Vanessa Nascimento\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nMONOGAMY isn\u2019t for everyone - and it certainly isn\u2019t for Brazilian based model Arthur O Urso, who is in a poly relationship with his loving wife Luana, and their seven other girlfriends. Arthur admits he was always worried about finding love due to his 'plump size' but after meeting and marrying Luana he was inspired to drop nearly five stone and gained his confidence back. At this point, the married couple started introducing more partners to their now poly lifestyle. Since sharing their story with the world they have received negative judgment from every angle with people saying their lifestyle is \u201cdisgusting\u201d - but remain confident in their decision and choose to ignore the trolls and focus on their own happiness. Arthur said: \u201cTo remember their names for a while was difficult but not now. These days I fight for a cause and many admire the courage I have to confront society and live the life I always dreamt of. The main consequence of this lifestyle is being excluded from society, because it\u2019s hard to make friends, especially when you have this status and image. But we never cared for friendship. We always lived for each other, always. Since the beginning of the relationship we always thought that we don\u2019t need other people to be happy. That\u2019s why we never listened to other people, we chose to live the life we always wanted.\u201d\n\nFollow their story here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/arthurourso/?hl=en\n\nVideographer: Pedro Ladeira\nProducers: Marilia Marasciulo, Daniel Coles, Kim Nguyen \nEditor: Vanessa Nascimento\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

She's been growing her nails since early 2007 and they're currently 13-14\". Janene\u2019s favourite nail design is glued buttons to her nails that she has been doing since 2019. Janene gets a lot of stares and judgement but says she likes the negativity as it means she stands out. She's part of the Long Nail Goddesses - a group of women who are addicted to growing their nails, some up to 20\" long. \n\nFollow Janene here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/janenereed/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006605982716\n\nFollow Maria here:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ortiz.marianails\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ortizmarianails/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkVXW9fmaEkxCd6bHT8pMAg\n\nVideographer: Kevin Huang\nProducers: Rafaela Kuznec, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Will Strange\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

They fell in love and went from high school sweethearts to life partners. Mickey always knew she was bisexual and was open with Joel about this throughout their relationship. In September 2020, Joel met Jaida, 22 on an app. The group began their interactions platonically, but then their relationship grew to a romantic place. Jaida had never seriously considered being in a polyamorous relationship before, she told Truly: \u201cI was like how do they do that like, I can't even handle one person like, imagine two.\u201d The group has faced criticism for their lifestyle. Jaida\u2019s family has found the relationship hard to accept due to their religious beliefs. The throuple has had people telling them that they\u2019re \u2018going to hell\u2019 or that they\u2019re \u2018ungodly\u2019. \n\nFollow the group here - \nhttps://www.instagram.com/_throupletrouble/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@_throupletrouble\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrvWq1YXNq1ka7hTJgIGQ_A/videos\n\nVideographer: Carlos de Varona\nProducers:\u2002Kate Moore, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Shiona Penrake\n\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

She has had 23 reconstructive surgeries throughout her life, and bears the scars on her face because of them. Growing up was difficult for Isabella, as her peers would call her names and say she 'looked scary' on one half of her face. Though she struggled with her image in the past, today Isabella has gone above and beyond accepting who she is. \n\nFollow Isabella here: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/isabella.welch/\n\nVideographer: Elie Khadra\nProducers:\u2002Giacomo Brunelli, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Tom Waddington\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

They were told at an ultrasound seven weeks into the pregnancy that there were \u2018five heartbeats instead of one\u2019 and could not believe the news as they had a hard time getting pregnant. Megan said she panicked and \u2018was thinking that I\u2019m 5\u20191, where are all these babies gonna go and how is this gonna work?\u2019 Despite all her infertility issues and health complications \u2018all of the quints were born in four minutes\u2019 and Megan \u2018could not believe how fast they were born\u2019. Talking about the judgement she received, the mum of seven says that people have commented on how irresponsible it is to have that many - but says most people have been super supportive and excited. \n\nFollow Megan here:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Hulen-Quintuplets-Hulen-Horde-100132268780490\n\nVideographer: Josh Stokka\nProducers: Nosheen Hussain, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Giulia Bassanese\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

They were told at an ultrasound seven weeks into the pregnancy that there were \u2018five heartbeats instead of one\u2019 and could not believe the news as they had a hard time getting pregnant. Megan said she panicked and \u2018was thinking that I\u2019m 5\u20191, where are all these babies gonna go and how is this gonna work?\u2019 Despite all her infertility issues and health complications \u2018all of the quints were born in four minutes\u2019 and Megan \u2018could not believe how fast they were born\u2019. Talking about the judgement she received, the mum of seven says that people have commented on how irresponsible it is to have that many - but says most people have been super supportive and excited. \n\nFollow Megan here:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Hulen-Quintuplets-Hulen-Horde-100132268780490\n\nVideographer: Josh Stokka\nProducers: Nosheen Hussain, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Giulia Bassanese\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Truly met up with the couple at their home in Sweden to hear about the incredible news that they\u2019re engaged and also hear how they\u2019ve dealt with the awful online judgement they\u2019ve had to face in their relationship.\n\nFollow Mathilda and Christian here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mathildahogbergs/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chrisblund/\n\nVideographer & Photographer: Per Christian Lind\nProducers: Tom Jones, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Reuben Yarwood\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Since her diagnosis, she has made it her mission to champion herself, her followers and everyone around her that a difficult diagnosis, no matter what it is, is only a part of your identity but not the full story.

The busy mom struggled with comfort eating and yo-yo dieting for many years, before deciding that she had to change her lifestyle. Alex chose to have weight loss surgery to help her with portion control. Despite the judgement she has received, Alex told Truly: \u201cSome people say that surgery is the easy way out, but it\u2019s categorically not. It saved my life!\u201d Alex has maintained her weight loss through a combination of healthy eating and exercise. She now enjoys working out and living an active lifestyle. She said: \u201cI hope that me speaking about how I chose to lose weight could help others on their weight loss journey.

Throughout her life, she has gone through at least eight different surgical procedures to remove the tumour. Her biggest surgery to date was in 2018, when most of her jaw was completely removed. After surgery, she had to re-learn the most basic things such as eating, swallowing liquids and talking. Although she struggled with her new appearance at first, today Sonya feels more confident than ever thanks to the support of her family and friends. \n\nFollow Sonya here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/b_csonya/\n\nVideographer: Pedro Ladeira\nProducers: Giacomo Brunelli, Kim Nguyen \nEditor: William Strange\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Three-year-old Maria, from Ipatinga, Brazil, was born with Bosma arhinia microphthalmia (BAM) Syndrome - an extremely rare genetic condition reportedly known to affect less than 100 people worldwide.

She found out she was 26 weeks pregnant at 21 years old because all her pregnancy symptoms were symptoms she already had due to being overweight. After she gave birth, she was in the ICU for weeks and after that, her doctor told her that if she carried on her lifestyle she would die at 22 stone \u2013 it gave her a wake-up call. Leah says getting weight loss surgery is just a tool and she maintains her weight by controlling food rather than letting it control her and going to the gym. \n\nFollow Leah here: https://www.instagram.com/leahpunch_bypassbyleah/ \n\nVideographer: Paddy Murray\nProducers:\u2002Nosheen Hussain, Yasmin Walker \nEditor: William Strange \n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Carly was always heavier growing up, but when her weight reached 300lbs her mental health began to decline. Alongside weight loss surgery, Carly followed a basic keto diet and worked out multiple times a week to lose 140lbs in total. Now she\u2019s lost the weight, Carly has continued to follow a healthy lifestyle to maintain her weight. Despite this success, she told Truly: \u201cI\u2019m the most confident I\u2019ve ever been, but now I have new insecurities because I have loose skin and a whole new body.\u201d To combat this sense of body dysmorphia, Carly says it\u2019s important to learn how to love your body at every stage of your weight loss journey. \n\nFollow Carly here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/carlyycamilla/\n\nWith thanks to the team at https://www.instagram.com/synergyclubmass/\n\nVideographer: Colin Bell\nProducers:\u2002Milly Martin, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Ethan Edwards \n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Bruna has spent just shy of $100,000 on making her house as pink as possible - and boasts over 16 million followers on TikTok. She says the colour pink means 'everything' to her, as it represents her style, personality and happiness. Every single object in her house, which was recently partially redesigned, is a different shade of pink. The highlight of her house is arguably the kitchen, where Bruna cooks her Barbie-inspired dishes with her exclusively pink kitchen utensils. Even Bruna's car is fully coloured in pink; attracting lots of attention when she is out and about. \n\nFollow Bruna here: \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@brunabarbieoficial \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brunabarbieoficial/\n\nVideographer: Bruno Mazzoco\nProducers:\u2002Giacomo Brunelli, Becky Robinson\nEditor: Garry Sykes\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Bruna has spent just shy of $100,000 on making her house as pink as possible - and boasts over 16 million followers on TikTok. She says the colour pink means 'everything' to her, as it represents her style, personality and happiness. Every single object in her house, which was recently partially redesigned, is a different shade of pink. The highlight of her house is arguably the kitchen, where Bruna cooks her Barbie-inspired dishes with her exclusively pink kitchen utensils. Even Bruna's car is fully coloured in pink; attracting lots of attention when she is out and about. \n\nFollow Bruna here: \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@brunabarbieoficial \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brunabarbieoficial/\n\nVideographer: Bruno Mazzoco\nProducers:\u2002Giacomo Brunelli, Becky Robinson\nEditor: Garry Sykes\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

The 26-year-old from Johannesburg, South Africa, is a model and content creator with phocomelia - a rare congenital condition that causes limb mutation and deformity. Growing up, Zizipho had struggled to get accepted by her peers because of her disability. Over the years, she has learned to embrace her body by modelling and working as an influencer. While enjoying a rise in her career, Zizipho is looking for a guy that shares her values in hard work. She is going on a blind date today in the hope of meeting someone special. Zizipho told Truly: \"I don't think dating without having an arm or a leg is a problem.

The 26-year-old from Johannesburg, South Africa, is a model and content creator with phocomelia - a rare congenital condition that causes limb mutation and deformity. Growing up, Zizipho had struggled to get accepted by her peers because of her disability. Over the years, she has learned to embrace her body by modelling and working as an influencer. While enjoying a rise in her career, Zizipho is looking for a guy that shares her values in hard work. She is going on a blind date today in the hope of meeting someone special. Zizipho told Truly: \"I don't think dating without having an arm or a leg is a problem. If you have character, you have everything.\" Will Zizipho's date look past her disability?\n\nFollow Zizipho on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/zizipho_soldat/\n\nVideographer: Charles Meadows\nProducers:\u2002Kim Nguyen & Emilia Jiang\nEditor: Helen McKee\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

While in their previous jobs, Jess and Mike were so busy with their work they struggled to spend quality time with their 12-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son. When the pandemic hit and put their work to a halt, the couple started looking into alternative ways to support their family. They began filming amateur pornography and were surprised to see their videos quickly accumulating popularity. Jess and Mike's career move has caused friction with some family members. They also received heavy criticism online. But the couple believe they've made the right decision for their family.\n\nVideographer: Jan-Paul Bednarz \nProducers: Emilia Jiang, Yasmin Walker \nEditor: Garry Sykes\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Wazir, from Jaipur, India, was born with Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic bone disorder also known as \u2018brittle bone disease\u2019.

Nyla, who\u2019s from LA, cannot sweat which means she\u2019s at risk of overheating and it\u2019s important that she bathes several times per day to clear away excess skin. Fortunately she loves bath time and her condition certainly doesn\u2019t stop her from being a fashion icon.

The craving is so strong that if left alone and with access to food, a person with Prader-Willi Syndrome could eat themselves to death. That means Larry and Camille\u2019s mother Kim must create a completely \u2018food secure\u2019 environment, including padlocking kitchen cabinets and having an alarm on the kitchen door to stop Camille foraging for snacks.

The craving is so strong that if left alone and with access to food, a person with Prader-Willi Syndrome could eat themselves to death. That means Larry and Camille\u2019s mother Kim must create a completely \u2018food secure\u2019 environment, including padlocking kitchen cabinets and having an alarm on the kitchen door to stop Camille foraging for snacks. Camille\u2019s sneakiness around food has earned her the nickname the \u2018stealth ninja\u2019, but despite her ever-present hunger, people with Prader-Willi have low muscle tone and burn calories slowly, meaning she is required to subsist on a diet of 1,000-1,200 calories a day.

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nMARY Aquino, 24, first noticed her vitiligo when she was nine years old after she fell and scraped her knee - and it never healed properly. Mary explained to Truly: \u201cVitiligo is the depigmentation of the cells in the skin. I lack melanin, which is caused by an autoimmune disorder, which means my body is attacking itself.\u201d Mary\u2019s vitiligo now takes over all of her legs and arms, as well as other patches on her body. There was a time in her life where she would actively try to cover up as much as possible, spending hours applying special makeup to hide her vitiligo. However, over time she has grown in confidence and learned to accept herself fully. Mary admits to having trust issues when it comes to men - she has had some experiences where she feels she has been fetishzised. Mary described what makes dating different for her: \u201cI get in my head too much about how other people view my vitiligo or how they would react or respond. I have a fear of rejection so I reject myself first, but I\u2019m working on it.\" Today, Mary is going on her first ever blind date, will her date help restore her faith in men?!\n\nFollow Mary here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mary_aquino_/?hl=en\n\nFollow John here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/C9LYFE/ \n\nThank you to Giovanni Filippi for the use of this photography, you can find more of his work here: https://www.instagram.com/giovannifilippi_/ \n\nVideographer: Carlos de Varona\nProducers: Ruby Coote & Joel Ross\nEditor: Sonia Estal\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nMARY Aquino, 24, first noticed her vitiligo when she was nine years old after she fell and scraped her knee - and it never healed properly. Mary explained to Truly: \u201cVitiligo is the depigmentation of the cells in the skin. I lack melanin, which is caused by an autoimmune disorder, which means my body is attacking itself.\u201d Mary\u2019s vitiligo now takes over all of her legs and arms, as well as other patches on her body. There was a time in her life where she would actively try to cover up as much as possible, spending hours applying special makeup to hide her vitiligo. However, over time she has grown in confidence and learned to accept herself fully. Mary admits to having trust issues when it comes to men - she has had some experiences where she feels she has been fetishzised. Mary described what makes dating different for her: \u201cI get in my head too much about how other people view my vitiligo or how they would react or respond. I have a fear of rejection so I reject myself first, but I\u2019m working on it.\" Today, Mary is going on her first ever blind date, will her date help restore her faith in men?!\n\nFollow Mary here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mary_aquino_/?hl=en\n\nFollow John here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/C9LYFE/ \n\nThank you to Giovanni Filippi for the use of this photography, you can find more of his work here: https://www.instagram.com/giovannifilippi_/ \n\nVideographer: Carlos de Varona\nProducers: Ruby Coote & Joel Ross\nEditor: Sonia Estal\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Destinee identifies as pansexual and is open to all genders and sexualities - will her blind date be as open minded? \n\nFollow Nate here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/natedog7000/ \n\nVideographer: Adams Wood, Peter Lutz\nProducers: Joel Ross, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Hailey Wang\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Natasha Crown, 27, originally from Serbia, says she first realised she wanted a super-sized bum at the age of 18. Two years later, Natasha started her cosmetic journey from 'athletic teen to a curvy goddess'.

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nKAILEY and Nathan had known each other for a few years but when they found out she was pregnant at just 16, they\u2019d only been dating a short time. Kailey took a test as a joke with a friend; she was on birth control and had zero symptoms so when the result came back positive Kailey took another two because she couldn\u2019t believe it. For Kailey, who at that point was living in Alabama, abortion wasn\u2019t an option. It was over a week after finding out before Kailey had the courage to tell Nathan but he was excited and simply said \u2018ok well let\u2019s do this\u2019. They only told one other friend at school, keeping it secret until Kailey left school at six months pregnant to continue with online school. Living in a small town where teen moms tended to just go into hiding once their pregnancies were public knowledge, Kailey and Nathan were determined to change the narrative. Avery was born in March 2020, just as the world was going into lockdown. That meant that not only did Kailey and Nathan have to deal with being parents at a very young age but they also didn\u2019t get the usual support groups or family visits that would have happened outside of lockdown. It was 3-4 months before Kailey\u2019s dad got to meet his grandchild. This challenging start has prepared the young couple well, who are entirely self-sufficient. They got engaged when Kailey was just 17, Nathan, 19 with Nathan proposing on the beach. They are now married and live in Omaha, Nebraska for Nathan\u2019s job, while Kailey continues her studies and looks after Avery. Kailey started her YouTube channel and Instagram to be a safe space for other teen moms. She says: \u201cI wanted to not condone it, not encourage teen pregnancy but show the real side.\u201d \n\nFollow Kailey Here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFJNdM6JSr8y5ZXhXRUQXxQ\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kailey.pool/\n\nVideographer: Esai Saenz \nProducers: Nathalie Bonney, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Tom Buckman\u2002\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nKAILEY and Nathan had known each other for a few years but when they found out she was pregnant at just 16, they\u2019d only been dating a short time. Kailey took a test as a joke with a friend; she was on birth control and had zero symptoms so when the result came back positive Kailey took another two because she couldn\u2019t believe it. For Kailey, who at that point was living in Alabama, abortion wasn\u2019t an option. It was over a week after finding out before Kailey had the courage to tell Nathan but he was excited and simply said \u2018ok well let\u2019s do this\u2019. They only told one other friend at school, keeping it secret until Kailey left school at six months pregnant to continue with online school. Living in a small town where teen moms tended to just go into hiding once their pregnancies were public knowledge, Kailey and Nathan were determined to change the narrative. Avery was born in March 2020, just as the world was going into lockdown. That meant that not only did Kailey and Nathan have to deal with being parents at a very young age but they also didn\u2019t get the usual support groups or family visits that would have happened outside of lockdown. It was 3-4 months before Kailey\u2019s dad got to meet his grandchild. This challenging start has prepared the young couple well, who are entirely self-sufficient. They got engaged when Kailey was just 17, Nathan, 19 with Nathan proposing on the beach. They are now married and live in Omaha, Nebraska for Nathan\u2019s job, while Kailey continues her studies and looks after Avery. Kailey started her YouTube channel and Instagram to be a safe space for other teen moms. She says: \u201cI wanted to not condone it, not encourage teen pregnancy but show the real side.\u201d \n\nFollow Kailey Here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFJNdM6JSr8y5ZXhXRUQXxQ\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kailey.pool/\n\nVideographer: Esai Saenz \nProducers: Nathalie Bonney, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Tom Buckman\u2002\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Her obesity made her lose her vision whilst she was carrying her baby down the stairs, causing the child to fall. It made her realise that losing weight \u201cwasn't looking a certain way or weighing a certain magic number, it\u2019s really life or death\u201d. After this incident, she decided to change her life to be healthier for her children. Christina went to nutrition school to try and learn why she couldn\u2019t lose weight after six different doctors couldn\u2019t figure it out. She is now a Master Nutritionist and helps people lose weight by fixing their relationship with food.\n\nConnect with Christina on Social Media:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fitbodyweightloss\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fitbodyweightloss\nhttps://www.youtube.com/fitbodyweightloss\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/fitbodyweightloss\n\nVideographer: Andrew Keil\nProducers: Nosheen Hussain, Vanessa Nascimento\nEditor: Natalia Giorgi \n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nCHRISTINA Jordan, 40, from Arizona, lost 134lbs naturally after being 271lbs for as long as she could remember. Her obesity made her lose her vision whilst she was carrying her baby down the stairs, causing the child to fall. It made her realise that losing weight \u201cwasn't looking a certain way or weighing a certain magic number, it\u2019s really life or death\u201d. After this incident, she decided to change her life to be healthier for her children. Christina went to nutrition school to try and learn why she couldn\u2019t lose weight after six different doctors couldn\u2019t figure it out. She is now a Master Nutritionist and helps people lose weight by fixing their relationship with food.\n\nConnect with Christina on Social Media:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fitbodyweightloss\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fitbodyweightloss\nhttps://www.youtube.com/fitbodyweightloss\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/fitbodyweightloss\n\nVideographer: Andrew Keil\nProducers: Nosheen Hussain, Vanessa Nascimento\nEditor: Natalia Giorgi \n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Meg, 21, has functional neurological disorder (FND) - where the basic wiring of the nervous system is intact, but the brain is unable to send or receive signals properly.

Describing it as 'mother's intuition', Cherrelle Granville, 31, from The Hague, Netherlands, says she has always wanted to breastfeed her children for as long as possible - even beyond toddlerhood. When Cherrelle had her first child Christiano, now 11, she was forced to stop breastfeeding him aged two after her desire to continue was met with disapproval among family and friends. As Cherrelle began to educate herself on long-term breastfeeding, she was welcomed by a community of mothers who shared the same belief and gave Cherrelle the support she needed. After her daughter Cavani was born, Cherrelle decided to fully embrace the nursing method regardless of others' judgement. Four years later, Cherrelle has been breastfeeding Cavani at least once a day with no plans of stopping it anytime soon. Now the proud mother regularly shares her breastfeeding photos on social media in a bid to raise awareness of extended nursing and natural parenting.\n\nFollow Cherrelle here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fromcherrywithlove/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxBQtZ8_VbuPuHA_BJuK9bw\n\nFollow Eva (photograher) here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/evabours_fotografie/\n\nThanks to @devrouwmetcamera for providing additional photography for this project. \n\nFollow Nanouk here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/devrouwmetcamera/\n\nVideographer: Hans Peter Schepp\nProducers: Emilia Jiang, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Sonia Estal\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA MUM-OF-TWO, and an advocate of extended nursing, has been breastfeeding her four-year-old daughter every day since she was born. Describing it as 'mother's intuition', Cherrelle Granville, 31, from The Hague, Netherlands, says she has always wanted to breastfeed her children for as long as possible - even beyond toddlerhood. When Cherrelle had her first child Christiano, now 11, she was forced to stop breastfeeding him aged two after her desire to continue was met with disapproval among family and friends. As Cherrelle began to educate herself on long-term breastfeeding, she was welcomed by a community of mothers who shared the same belief and gave Cherrelle the support she needed. After her daughter Cavani was born, Cherrelle decided to fully embrace the nursing method regardless of others' judgement. Four years later, Cherrelle has been breastfeeding Cavani at least once a day with no plans of stopping it anytime soon. Now the proud mother regularly shares her breastfeeding photos on social media in a bid to raise awareness of extended nursing and natural parenting.\n\nFollow Cherrelle here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fromcherrywithlove/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxBQtZ8_VbuPuHA_BJuK9bw\n\nFollow Eva (photograher) here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/evabours_fotografie/\n\nThanks to @devrouwmetcamera for providing additional photography for this project. \n\nFollow Nanouk here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/devrouwmetcamera/\n\nVideographer: Hans Peter Schepp\nProducers: Emilia Jiang, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Sonia Estal\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Overweight and miserable with her job back in Wales, Jazymne decided she needed to change everything about her life. After quitting her job, she had a breast enhancement, upping her size to a 32N, and followed it up with a Brazilian butt lift, new teeth and a stringent exercise routine. When a friend suggested she set up an OnlyFans account to flaunt her new body, she found posting pictures of herself online boosted her confidence, and was soon earning more in a month than she did in a year as an accountant. Now based in Las Vegas, Jazmyne\u2019s moved on to creating professional content for her own website and is branching out into fitness, with no plans to return to her old life in finance.\n\nGym: https://www.instagram.com/smashironfitness/\n\nVideographer: Travis Robinson\nProducers:\u2002Jake Slight and Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Tom Waddington\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Overweight and miserable with her job back in Wales, Jazymne decided she needed to change everything about her life. After quitting her job, she had a breast enhancement, upping her size to a 32N, and followed it up with a Brazilian butt lift, new teeth and a stringent exercise routine. When a friend suggested she set up an OnlyFans account to flaunt her new body, she found posting pictures of herself online boosted her confidence, and was soon earning more in a month than she did in a year as an accountant. Now based in Las Vegas, Jazmyne\u2019s moved on to creating professional content for her own website and is branching out into fitness, with no plans to return to her old life in finance.\n\nGym: https://www.instagram.com/smashironfitness/\n\nVideographer: Travis Robinson\nProducers:\u2002Jake Slight and Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Tom Waddington\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Telsah told truly: \"I used food as a comfort for anything, whether it was sadness, happiness, scared, stress, it didn't matter what it was.\" This unhealthy binge eating led to her weight gain and despite showing a happy exterior, Telsah kept her real feelings hidden way inside.

I knew I needed to change my life.\" At the age of 18, Telsah decided to act and made the life changing decision to have vertical gastric sleeve surgery. With a lot of hard work, changing her diet and working closely with a personal trainer, Telsah dropped an incredible 120lbs and has finally got the body and confidence she always wanted.

The condition occurs at an estimate of about 1 in 10,000 births. When Monroe's mum, Heaven, was told by the doctors that her daughter had no eyes, it came as a complete surprise as until this point nothing had been detected. Although it hasn\u2019t been easy, Heaven was determined to show Monroe that she could still achieve everything she wanted. Heaven told Truly: \u201cMonroe\u2019s biggest strength is her adaptability, she could so easily be dependent on me but she is fiercely independent.\" Monroe loves to sing and act, and is fearless in her approach to everything she does. The pair have also set up a clothing brand called \"Love Is Blind\"  with the mission to bring awareness to diversity and inclusion, while advocating for blindness.\n\nFollow Monroe here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/monroewright_/ \nhttp://www.teammonroe.org/\n\nThank you to Rob for his photography.

The condition occurs at an estimate of about 1 in 10,000 births. When Monroe's mum, Heaven, was told by the doctors that her daughter had no eyes, it came as a complete surprise as until this point nothing had been detected. Although it hasn\u2019t been easy, Heaven was determined to show Monroe that she could still achieve everything she wanted. Heaven told Truly: \u201cMonroe\u2019s biggest strength is her adaptability, she could so easily be dependent on me but she is fiercely independent.\" Monroe loves to sing and act, and is fearless in her approach to everything she does. The pair have also set up a clothing brand called \"Love Is Blind\"  with the mission to bring awareness to diversity and inclusion, while advocating for blindness.\n\nFollow Monroe here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/monroewright_/ \nhttp://www.teammonroe.org/\n\nThank you to Rob for his photography.

Her newest goal is to push things even further and she is currently training for her first bodybuilding competition. She told Truly: \"I want to be the healthiest, best version of myself when I walk across that stage to say goodbye to that 300lb version of myself.\"\n\nFollow Tori here: https://www.instagram.com/torrrrrific/ \n\nVideographer: Trent Wittenbach, Andrew Olson\nProducers:\u2002Kim Nguyen, Adam Fleet\nEditor: Athina Chatzidaki\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Diagnosed with her condition at birth, Assya was only given 24 hours to live but has defied the odds and doesn't let the EB affect her positivity. Due to her condition, Assya lives with painful blisters all throughout her body, both externally and internally.

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nCRYING herself to sleep after trying what felt like every diet going and losing no weight, Martyna couldn\u2019t see a way out. She describes her relationship to food as an addiction that was ruining her life. The change in her weight loss journey came when she focused on finding foods and exercise that she actually enjoyed, not to mention placing a bet that she would lose 100lbs within a year - and she did just that. Binge eating had been a part of Martyna\u2019s life since she was a child. From age 19 she went to Overeaters Anonymous but stopped after a number of years: it wasn\u2019t so much the desire for food itself that was the problem but more how she used food as a solution to her problems in life. When lockdown hit, Martyna realised it was the perfect time to lose weight - she didn\u2019t need to go out, could drink water at home and phase in a more healthy diet - she became vegan and now eats a predominantly plant-based diet. Every single morning before she had a chance to think what day it was, Martyna would put on her trainers and at 6am go for a long walk. She also discovered she loved at home weight workouts and would do personal training sessions in the park once the lockdown eased. \n\nFollow Martyna here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/consistencykilledthefat/\n\nVideographer: Alessandro Di Rosa\nProducers:\u2002Nathalie Bonney, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Tom Waddington\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nCRYING herself to sleep after trying what felt like every diet going and losing no weight, Martyna couldn\u2019t see a way out. She describes her relationship to food as an addiction that was ruining her life. The change in her weight loss journey came when she focused on finding foods and exercise that she actually enjoyed, not to mention placing a bet that she would lose 100lbs within a year - and she did just that. Binge eating had been a part of Martyna\u2019s life since she was a child. From age 19 she went to Overeaters Anonymous but stopped after a number of years: it wasn\u2019t so much the desire for food itself that was the problem but more how she used food as a solution to her problems in life. When lockdown hit, Martyna realised it was the perfect time to lose weight - she didn\u2019t need to go out, could drink water at home and phase in a more healthy diet - she became vegan and now eats a predominantly plant-based diet. Every single morning before she had a chance to think what day it was, Martyna would put on her trainers and at 6am go for a long walk. She also discovered she loved at home weight workouts and would do personal training sessions in the park once the lockdown eased. \n\nFollow Martyna here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/consistencykilledthefat/\n\nVideographer: Alessandro Di Rosa\nProducers:\u2002Nathalie Bonney, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Tom Waddington\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

With a mum and grandmother who were both teen mums themselves, Macey\u2019s family were worried about the impact this would have on her. And even Macey herself had her doubts: \u201cI didn\u2019t really think I was cut out to be a mum, I didn\u2019t really want kids and used to judge teen mums.\u201d However, the highschool freshman decided to keep her baby and Macey gave birth to her daughter Scarlett last year. Macey has been documenting her experiences as a teen mum online to support other young mums. Whilst she receives huge amounts of support on her social media platforms, she has also faced a lot of judgment and negativity. \u201cI received a lot of hate when I was pregnant, I had people drag my name through the mudd.\u201d Determined not to let the negativity get to her, Macey continues to share her story and today she\u2019s meeting her cousin Taylor to take some pictures for social media. \n\nFollow Macey here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/maceyyburnett/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@maceyyburnett \n\nVideographer: Michael Catron\nProducers:\u2002 Stephanie Stijkel, Ruby Coote \nEditor: Giulia Bassanese \n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\n16-YEAR OLD teen mum Macey from Atlanta, Georgia was just 14 when she found out that she was pregnant and expecting her first child. \u201cWhen I found out I was pregnant it was hard to process, I was really shocked,\u201d Macey told Truly. With a mum and grandmother who were both teen mums themselves, Macey\u2019s family were worried about the impact this would have on her. And even Macey herself had her doubts: \u201cI didn\u2019t really think I was cut out to be a mum, I didn\u2019t really want kids and used to judge teen mums.\u201d However, the highschool freshman decided to keep her baby and Macey gave birth to her daughter Scarlett last year. Macey has been documenting her experiences as a teen mum online to support other young mums. Whilst she receives huge amounts of support on her social media platforms, she has also faced a lot of judgment and negativity. \u201cI received a lot of hate when I was pregnant, I had people drag my name through the mudd.\u201d Determined not to let the negativity get to her, Macey continues to share her story and today she\u2019s meeting her cousin Taylor to take some pictures for social media. \n\nFollow Macey here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/maceyyburnett/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@maceyyburnett \n\nVideographer: Michael Catron\nProducers:\u2002 Stephanie Stijkel, Ruby Coote \nEditor: Giulia Bassanese \n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

The 25-year-old twins, of Stockton-On-Tees, UK, started getting lip filler together at the age of 18 and have since undergone surgery together too. The twins had breast augmentations on the same day, by the same surgeon and asked for the same size and both underwent rhinoplasty surgery earlier this year - again on the same day and asked for the same shape. They describe their look as \u2018hyper feminine, girly, glamorous and luxurious'. Both Dolly and Daisy are planning to have BBLs in the future, but differ on where to get them done - will Daisy be able to convince Dolly to hold off? And what will their mum think of their future plans? Daisy told Truly: \u201cI would say our ultimate goal is to look even more identical than we are now. So we will continue getting more cosmetic procedures to look more identical.\u201d \n\nFollow the twins on Instagram:\nDolly: https://www.instagram.com/dolly_bxo/ \nDaisy: https://www.instagram.com/missdaisyxox/\n\nVideographer:  Paul Chambers\nProducers:\u2002Emika Berry\nEditor: Shiona Penrake\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nTWIN sisters Daisy and Dolly have together spent \u00a3140,000 on cosmetic procedures in a bid to look as identical as possible. The 25-year-old twins, of Stockton-On-Tees, UK, started getting lip filler together at the age of 18 and have since undergone surgery together too. The twins had breast augmentations on the same day, by the same surgeon and asked for the same size and both underwent rhinoplasty surgery earlier this year - again on the same day and asked for the same shape. They describe their look as \u2018hyper feminine, girly, glamorous and luxurious'. Both Dolly and Daisy are planning to have BBLs in the future, but differ on where to get them done - will Daisy be able to convince Dolly to hold off? And what will their mum think of their future plans? Daisy told Truly: \u201cI would say our ultimate goal is to look even more identical than we are now. So we will continue getting more cosmetic procedures to look more identical.\u201d \n\nFollow the twins on Instagram:\nDolly: https://www.instagram.com/dolly_bxo/ \nDaisy: https://www.instagram.com/missdaisyxox/\n\nVideographer:  Paul Chambers\nProducers:\u2002Emika Berry\nEditor: Shiona Penrake\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

When motivational speaker Winston, 35, and life coach Mayfair, 23, met at a networking event in 2018, neither were thinking about romance, so the bond they struck up was initially platonic. But in time, romance blossomed. Because Winston has a condition called osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) - a skeletal disorder causing bones to become brittle - part of becoming a couple was a candid conversation about what his disability would mean for them. From there, their relationship went from strength to strength, and they got married last August. But when their wedding pictures unexpectedly went viral, they were met with some nasty comments. Mayfair was dubbed a \"golddigger\" and accused of cheating, while Winston was called \"selfish\" for being with her. They also deal with judgment in the real world, with some people asking intrusive questions, or assuming Winston cannot speak for himself. Happily, though, the couple, who document their relationship on YouTube, recently discovered Mayfair was pregnant and are now committed to being the \"best parents possible.\"\n\nFollow Winston and Mayfair at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TheClements\nhttps://www.instagram.com/theclements_/\n\nVideographer: Matthew Hurley\nProducers: Erin Cardiff & Ruby Coote\nEditor: Giulia Bassanese\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nAN INTERABLED couple whose wedding pictures went viral have hit back at cruel trolls who judged their relationship. When motivational speaker Winston, 35, and life coach Mayfair, 23, met at a networking event in 2018, neither were thinking about romance, so the bond they struck up was initially platonic. But in time, romance blossomed. Because Winston has a condition called osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) - a skeletal disorder causing bones to become brittle - part of becoming a couple was a candid conversation about what his disability would mean for them. From there, their relationship went from strength to strength, and they got married last August. But when their wedding pictures unexpectedly went viral, they were met with some nasty comments. Mayfair was dubbed a \"golddigger\" and accused of cheating, while Winston was called \"selfish\" for being with her. They also deal with judgment in the real world, with some people asking intrusive questions, or assuming Winston cannot speak for himself. Happily, though, the couple, who document their relationship on YouTube, recently discovered Mayfair was pregnant and are now committed to being the \"best parents possible.\"\n\nFollow Winston and Mayfair at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TheClements\nhttps://www.instagram.com/theclements_/\n\nVideographer: Matthew Hurley\nProducers: Erin Cardiff & Ruby Coote\nEditor: Giulia Bassanese\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Originally from Romania, at the age of just eight years old, Marius was involved in a tragic accident. His father threw a gas can onto his mum in a heated argument causing a house fire that took both of his parents\u2019 lives. Marius suffered third and fourth-degree burns, causing 75% of his body to be covered in burns. Since the accident, Marius has been in six relationships, but is yet to find the \u2018one\u2019. Marius told Truly: \u201cBecause of my burns, I found that it\u2019s a little harder to date. I\u2019ve tried dating apps, but I don\u2019t understand the emotion that someone might bring when texting.\u201d Marius is excited and nervous to see how his blind date will take to his burns. \u201cIt was six months ago I went on a date, so I'm really excited to get another chance to go on another date and see how things go.\u201d Will Marius meet the girl of his dreams?\n\nFollow Marius here:\nMarius Wooward Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/teammarius1/\n\nFollow Julia here:\nJulia Conti Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/juliacontii/\n\nVideographer: Clint Montgomery and Joe Roberts \nProducers:\u2002Dav Rich and Ruby Coote\nEditor: Paul Zeller\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Jennifer got her first surgery at the age of 17 when she underwent a breast augmentation and has since had three nose jobs, other breast augmentations, liposuction and even underwent nine surgeries in 24 hours.

While she has some regrets, Jennifer loves her look. Jennifer wanted to look like Kim Kardashian because she thinks she is beautiful but now feels she can be a bigger star. Jennifer told Truly: \u201cIt\u2019s my turn right now. Keeping Up With The Kardashians is over, it\u2019s done, so they did very well.

The 28-year-old, originally from Brazil, has spent over \u20ac600,000 on more than 20 cosmetic procedures to create her dream body. Jennifer got her first surgery at the age of 17 when she underwent a breast augmentation and has since had three nose jobs, other breast augmentations, liposuction and even underwent nine surgeries in 24 hours. Jennifer has endured some bad experiences with some of her surgeries, including being in pain as a result and would not want other girls to get surgery as young as she did. While she has some regrets, Jennifer loves her look. Jennifer wanted to look like Kim Kardashian because she thinks she is beautiful but now feels she can be a bigger star. Jennifer told Truly: \u201cIt\u2019s my turn right now. Keeping Up With The Kardashians is over, it\u2019s done, so they did very well.

Based in Russia, Kate\u2019s similarity to Scarlett was first noticed by her classmates at school when she was just 12 years old. She looks so much like Scarlett, her Instagram gets flooded with well wishing messages as fans think Kate\u2019s profile is actually the real Scarlett J\u2019s... Kate not only looks like Scarlett, she also regularly dresses up in cosplay as Johansson\u2019s Marvel character Black Widow, performing dances and comedy sketches on her TikTok with each upload gaining her thousands of views. Her Black Widow content has changed Kate\u2019s life; her first video in costume went viral. Encouraged by this success she quit her job as a sales manager and is now a full time model and content creator. Kate hopes to one day meet Scarlett in person and often wonders if the Hollywood A-Lister has heard about her and the uncanny likeness they share. \n\nFollow Kate here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/mimisskate/?hl=en\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mimisskate?lang=en\nhttps://instagram.com/pear.l.y?utm_medium=copy_link\n\nVideographer: Faik Geci\nProducers:\u2002Tom Jones, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Oscar McDonagh\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nMODEL and social media sensation Kate Shumskaya bears a startling resemblance to Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson. Based in Russia, Kate\u2019s similarity to Scarlett was first noticed by her classmates at school when she was just 12 years old. She looks so much like Scarlett, her Instagram gets flooded with well wishing messages as fans think Kate\u2019s profile is actually the real Scarlett J\u2019s... Kate not only looks like Scarlett, she also regularly dresses up in cosplay as Johansson\u2019s Marvel character Black Widow, performing dances and comedy sketches on her TikTok with each upload gaining her thousands of views. Her Black Widow content has changed Kate\u2019s life; her first video in costume went viral. Encouraged by this success she quit her job as a sales manager and is now a full time model and content creator. Kate hopes to one day meet Scarlett in person and often wonders if the Hollywood A-Lister has heard about her and the uncanny likeness they share. \n\nFollow Kate here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/mimisskate/?hl=en\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mimisskate?lang=en\nhttps://instagram.com/pear.l.y?utm_medium=copy_link\n\nVideographer: Faik Geci\nProducers:\u2002Tom Jones, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Oscar McDonagh\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

The teenager decided to keep her baby, and in February of 2020 her son Jordan was born. In August that same year, Ava fell pregnant for a second time, she told Truly: \u201cThe second pregnancy was the most traumatic experience of my life. I just sat and cried, I could cope with one child, but the thought of having another one was devastating.\u201d In May of 2021, Ava gave birth to her second child, daughter Aveaya at the age of 15. Being a young mum of two can be challenging, Ava explained: \u201cRegular girls my age, they\u2019ll babysit and they can give the kids back to their mums at the end of the day. Well I can\u2019t do that, I have these kids 24/7, and it\u2019s really hard to adapt to that.\u201d Additionally, Ava deals with a lot of judgement towards being a teen mum, often receiving negative comments on her social media platforms where she talks about her life. Ava said: \u201cI get a lot of people say that I\u2019m too young to be a good mum. My kids changed my life in the aspects of maturity, love and patience.

Now she proclaims that self love is her superpower and has taken to TikTok to show the world. She said: \"I make these TikTok videos for both myself and others, just to let them know they can be plus size and still love yourself and your body.\" Today, Jasmine's journey is taking another huge step forward as she is taking part in her first poolside photoshoot. She feels ready, but how will she feel in front of the camera? \n\nFollow Jasmine Here:\nwww.instagram.com/jazzynichole19/\nwww.tiktok.com/@jasminejones654\n\nVideographer: Trent Wittenbach\nProducers:\u2002Adam Fleet, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Ethan Edwards\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

His first tumour became visible when he was 12 years old, beginning as a small lump behind his right ear and rapidly spreading until it eclipsed all his facial features. Purwanto, who works as a farmer, has to use a headband in order to see and his tumours make eating a challenge. But despite his condition, in his village he is well-liked and respected. Purwanto did have his tumours operated on in the past, but they grew back even worse - and now he says he does not want any further surgery as his mother forbade it. \n\nVideographer: Jefri Tarigan\nProducers:\u2002Tom Midlane, James Thorne\nEditor: Tom Waddington\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Based in Odessa, Ukraine, Alena\u2019s hair is a staggering 6ft long and the last time she had a haircut she was just five years old. Taking inspiration from her mother and grandmother who were also long hair enthusiasts, Alena is now famous in her home country and worldwide. Unsurprisingly, her long locks mean that Alena gets a lot of attention and she\u2019s developed a huge following on her Instagram page receiving thousands of likes on her posts.

If it\u2019s untied, Alena's hair now sweeps the ground when she walks so she sometimes wears her hair in a braid or a bun to stop it dragging along the floor and to allow her to drive. Although she doesn\u2019t cut or trim her hair Alena regularly visits her stylist who she has formed a strong connection with and together they experiment with different styles and looks. \n\nFollow Alena at: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/alona__kravchenko/\n\nAlena\u2019s Stylist:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alenastekolshikova_/\n\nVideographer: Anna Nekrasova, Oleksii Solodunov\nProducers:\u2002Tom Jones, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Sebastian Heseltine\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

If it\u2019s untied, Alena's hair now sweeps the ground when she walks so she sometimes wears her hair in a braid or a bun to stop it dragging along the floor and to allow her to drive. Although she doesn\u2019t cut or trim her hair Alena regularly visits her stylist who she has formed a strong connection with and together they experiment with different styles and looks. \n\nFollow Alena at: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/alona__kravchenko/\n\nAlena\u2019s Stylist:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alenastekolshikova_/\n\nVideographer: Anna Nekrasova, Oleksii Solodunov\nProducers:\u2002Tom Jones, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Sebastian Heseltine\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Their friendship developed and deepened through a mutual interest...TikTok. Quran started to develop feelings for Cheryl and felt like he had to go for it! He told Truly: \"I asked her out and I caught feelings first, we decided to make it into a relationship because we were both happy\". Then to their delight, their TikTok videos absolutely blew up so much that they even had celebrities reposting and commenting on their content.

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA MUM has embraced her birthmark after years of hiding away and refusing to leave the house without makeup on. Riana Botha, 36, was born with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare condition that affects the development of blood cells. As a result, she has a large port-wine stain birthmark on her face. In her younger years, the makeup artist, who lives in South Africa with her husband Hendrik, 33, and daughter Mia-Mari, eight, struggled with her confidence. But becoming a mother changed everything, and now, she feels happy in her own skin. She still has to deal with thoughtless comments from strangers, who ask if her birthmark is the result of a burn or car crash injury. But she hopes that by putting herself out there on social media, she will educate people about birthmarks, and inspire those living with them. She said: \"When I look into the mirror, I see a strong individual that doesn't allow other people's opinions to get her down.\"\n\nFollow Riana here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/rianabotha1984/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@rianabotha3?lang=en\n\nVideographer: Charles Meadows\nProducers: Erin Cardiff, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Tani McDowell \n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA MUM has embraced her birthmark after years of hiding away and refusing to leave the house without makeup on. Riana Botha, 36, was born with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare condition that affects the development of blood cells. As a result, she has a large port-wine stain birthmark on her face. In her younger years, the makeup artist, who lives in South Africa with her husband Hendrik, 33, and daughter Mia-Mari, eight, struggled with her confidence. But becoming a mother changed everything, and now, she feels happy in her own skin. She still has to deal with thoughtless comments from strangers, who ask if her birthmark is the result of a burn or car crash injury. But she hopes that by putting herself out there on social media, she will educate people about birthmarks, and inspire those living with them. She said: \"When I look into the mirror, I see a strong individual that doesn't allow other people's opinions to get her down.\"\n\nFollow Riana here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/rianabotha1984/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@rianabotha3?lang=en\n\nVideographer: Charles Meadows\nProducers: Erin Cardiff, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Tani McDowell \n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

The couple met online five years ago, and within six months had opened up their relationship and entered the world of swinging. Once they made that decision, Terri described it to Truly as: \u201cEntering a world they never knew existed and wanting to learn more and more everyday.\" Their very first threesome together was with an older woman, and the pair haven\u2019t looked back since.

The couple are keen to explore polyamory, and are now actively looking for a long term female partner to join them in a throuple.

The couple met online five years ago, and within six months had opened up their relationship and entered the world of swinging. Once they made that decision, Terri described it to Truly as: \u201cEntering a world they never knew existed and wanting to learn more and more everyday.\" Their very first threesome together was with an older woman, and the pair haven\u2019t looked back since. They both feel that opening up their relationship sexually has made them stronger, and love meeting like-minded people. The couple are keen to explore polyamory, and are now actively looking for a long term female partner to join them in a throuple. Tonight, they have a hot date lined up and the pressure is on to impress. \n\nVideographer: Sam Wilkinson\nProducers: Joel Ross and Ruby Coote\nEditor: Sonia Estal\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Unfortunately, Cheyenne and Donye also lost friends during the pregnancy, mostly because they no longer have the time to hangout with them anymore...\n\nCheyenne's TikTok:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@pedrotticheyenne\n\nVideographer: Nate Spicer\nProducers: Ruby Coote and Frazer Randalls\nEditor: Reuben Yarwood\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Charles, 16, has Neurofibromatosis, which causes tumours to grow along his nerves. The rare condition was first noticed by his father, Charles Sr., when he spotted a small black mole on his son\u2019s leg. The tumour now weighs around 5kg and makes life incredibly difficult for Charles. He told Truly: \u201cIt can be heavy for me to walk, it can be heavy to move. I can\u2019t go to school and it can be hard to play with my friends.\u201d Charles Sr. says people haven\u2019t always been sympathetic to his son\u2019s condition. He said: \u201cWhen little children come and they see him, they pass and they run. Some children are afraid when they see the foot.\u201d Now, two Liberian charities, Legacy Holding Foundation and Liberian Women Advocacy Network International, are working together to find a surgeon who can remove the growth. Dr Richards, from local hospital AMI Liberia, told Truly: \u201cI think the leg has gotten bigger since we first saw him. It has become more plexiform, meaning it has folded upon itself.\" Charles, who wants to be an electrician when he\u2019s older, is staying positive, and hopes he can get the treatment he desperately needs.

Portland based couple Eli and Mikey, had been together for 16 years as a straight, monogamous couple, before they met Alida on a camping trip. In spite of the throuple\u2019s clear love and acceptance of one another, the relationship has not been without its judgement. This has often manifested itself in the form of stares and comments from strangers, but the triad don\u2019t hide their affection and defy the looks by holding hands and showing their love in public. Online, the comments about their relationship are easier to ignore, but Mikey admits those that suggest they are \u201cdestroying their kids\u201d can be hurtful. \n\nFollow Eli, Mikey and Alida here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/teamtriadtribe/ \n\nVideographer: Taylor Bluemel\nProducers: Frazer Randalls and Charles Richards\nEditor: Akash Beri\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Portland based couple Eli and Mikey, had been together for 16 years as a straight, monogamous couple, before they met Alida on a camping trip. In spite of the throuple\u2019s clear love and acceptance of one another, the relationship has not been without its judgement. This has often manifested itself in the form of stares and comments from strangers, but the triad don\u2019t hide their affection and defy the looks by holding hands and showing their love in public. Online, the comments about their relationship are easier to ignore, but Mikey admits those that suggest they are \u201cdestroying their kids\u201d can be hurtful. \n\nFollow Eli, Mikey and Alida here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/teamtriadtribe/ \n\nVideographer: Taylor Bluemel\nProducers: Frazer Randalls and Charles Richards\nEditor: Akash Beri\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Online, she has been subject to a tirade of cruel comments from trolls - but she is unfazed, and has vowed to continue working as a lookalike.\n\nFollow Ashten here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/kim_k_lookalike/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@kimklookalike1\n\nVideographer: Carlos De Verona\nProducers:\u2002Erin Cardiff, Charles Richards\nEditor: Shiona Penrake\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Luke Bohm, six, was born with Progeria, which occurs in around one out of eight million people, and there are only around 120 cases known worldwide.

Weighing in at 340lbs at her heaviest, Chelsey was consuming between 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day. The excess weight was increasingly affecting Chelsey\u2019s health, suffering from a high blood pressure and on the cusp of becoming diabetic. She told Truly: \u201cBefore my weight loss I was in denial about how much my weight affected my life, eating was my comfort and made me feel happier.\u201d And her wake up call happened on a day out at a theme park, Chelsey explained: \u201cI got on a rollercoaster, sat on the seat and the lap bar wouldn\u2019t latch over my body.

Weighing in at 340lbs at her heaviest, Chelsey was consuming between 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day. The excess weight was increasingly affecting Chelsey\u2019s health, suffering from a high blood pressure and on the cusp of becoming diabetic. She told Truly: \u201cBefore my weight loss I was in denial about how much my weight affected my life, eating was my comfort and made me feel happier.\u201d And her wake up call happened on a day out at a theme park, Chelsey explained: \u201cI got on a rollercoaster, sat on the seat and the lap bar wouldn\u2019t latch over my body. That was one of the most mortifying moments of my life.\u201d Chelsey started researching dieting and came across a friend who had lost 100lbs through a ketogenic way of eating.

Tessa Evans, 8, from County Derry, N. Ireland, is one of only 100 people in the world with Bosma arhinia microphthalmia (BAM) syndrome. When she was two, Tessa was the first person in the world to have a nasal implant made using 3D technology. At age four a larger nasal implant was fitted, but that subsequently had to be removed after becoming infected. Now Tessa\u2019s medical team, led by Dr Juling Ong, at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, are planning to insert a new implant next year and young Tessa can\u2019t help but be thrilled at the thought of finally having a nose. She said: \u201cI can\u2019t wait for my new nose, it\u2019s going to make me really happy.\u201d\n\nTo donate to Tessa\u2019s fundraising page, visit:\nhttps://gogetfunding.com/tessa-born-extraordinary/\n\nFollow Tessa\u2019s journey on social media: \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/tessabornextraordinary/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/bornwithoutanose/\n\nVideographer: Carl Best\nProducers: Camile Rocha-Keys, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Josh Halil\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA LITTLE girl born without a nose due to an ultra-rare genetic condition is due to have a brand new, 3D-printed nose implant fitted. Tessa Evans, 8, from County Derry, N. Ireland, is one of only 100 people in the world with Bosma arhinia microphthalmia (BAM) syndrome. When she was two, Tessa was the first person in the world to have a nasal implant made using 3D technology. At age four a larger nasal implant was fitted, but that subsequently had to be removed after becoming infected. Now Tessa\u2019s medical team, led by Dr Juling Ong, at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, are planning to insert a new implant next year and young Tessa can\u2019t help but be thrilled at the thought of finally having a nose. She said: \u201cI can\u2019t wait for my new nose, it\u2019s going to make me really happy.\u201d\n\nTo donate to Tessa\u2019s fundraising page, visit:\nhttps://gogetfunding.com/tessa-born-extraordinary/\n\nFollow Tessa\u2019s journey on social media: \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/tessabornextraordinary/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/bornwithoutanose/\n\nVideographer: Carl Best\nProducers: Camile Rocha-Keys, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Josh Halil\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Esther Jimenez, 37, was doused with a concoction commonly known as 'devil acid', by a stranger in 2011, whilst working at a cafe in the Dominican Republic. She suffered second and third-degree burns on her face and body and lost her eye. Her injuries were so severe her children could not even recognise her. She has undergone 28 surgeries to reconstruct her face, maimed by an attacker who has never been caught. Despite the ordeal, Esther has learned to embrace her appearance by regularly sharing photos and videos of herself on social media. She is also campaigning to lift the stigma around burn victims and promote tougher punishments for such attacks.\n\nYou can follow Esther on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jimenez.esther/\n\nVideographer: Julian Roa\nProducers: Emilia Jiang, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Pete Ansell\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Esther Jimenez, 37, was doused with a concoction commonly known as 'devil acid', by a stranger in 2011, whilst working at a cafe in the Dominican Republic. She suffered second and third-degree burns on her face and body and lost her eye. Her injuries were so severe her children could not even recognise her. She has undergone 28 surgeries to reconstruct her face, maimed by an attacker who has never been caught. Despite the ordeal, Esther has learned to embrace her appearance by regularly sharing photos and videos of herself on social media. She is also campaigning to lift the stigma around burn victims and promote tougher punishments for such attacks.\n\nYou can follow Esther on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jimenez.esther/\n\nVideographer: Julian Roa\nProducers: Emilia Jiang, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Pete Ansell\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Crystal from Texas, USA was once 420lbs and struggling with her health. After seeing a doctor, they recommended gastric bypass surgery to Crystal. Unfortunately after the surgery, Crystal\u2019s bad habits meant the weight came piling back. Crystal began exercising and went on a strict keto diet -  altogether she has lost 250lbs. Due to the amount of weight Crystal has lost, she was left with a huge amount of excess skin all over her body. At the beginning of 2021, she had a lower body lift and an arm lift - and she has now shown off her new look to her best friend for the first time.\n\nFollow Crystal here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/crystyle817/\n\nVideographer: Michael Rowley\nProducers:\u2002Shannon Lane, Kim Nguyen \nEditor: Hailey Wang \n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Crystal from Texas, USA was once 420lbs and struggling with her health. After seeing a doctor, they recommended gastric bypass surgery to Crystal. Unfortunately after the surgery, Crystal\u2019s bad habits meant the weight came piling back. Crystal began exercising and went on a strict keto diet -  altogether she has lost 250lbs. Due to the amount of weight Crystal has lost, she was left with a huge amount of excess skin all over her body. At the beginning of 2021, she had a lower body lift and an arm lift - and she has now shown off her new look to her best friend for the first time.\n\nFollow Crystal here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/crystyle817/\n\nVideographer: Michael Rowley\nProducers:\u2002Shannon Lane, Kim Nguyen \nEditor: Hailey Wang \n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

She has now been training for half her life and hopes to one day compete professionally at the games. Last year Brooklynn became the national champion for Olympic weightlifting in her age group, an achievement that took hours of dedication, and stepping outside of normal teenage existence. She fits in homeschooling in the morning and spends the rest of her day at the gym. \u201cI train six days a week, I get to the gym about noon, I leave anywhere from seven to eight,\u201d she said. Brooklynn trains with her father Cory, who is also her coach. Despite the pressure of their relentless workout schedule, he isn\u2019t concerned about creating a family rift.

Becca, 23, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was around 15 when she first noticed that her chest was lopsided. Over time, her breasts became increasingly uneven until she was an A cup on the left side, and a D on the right. Aged 18, she was diagnosed with Poland Syndrome - where the muscles do not develop on one side of the body. At first, she would wear a prosthetic breast and hide beneath baggy jumpers.

Becca, 23, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was around 15 when she first noticed that her chest was lopsided. Over time, her breasts became increasingly uneven until she was an A cup on the left side, and a D on the right. Aged 18, she was diagnosed with Poland Syndrome - where the muscles do not develop on one side of the body. At first, she would wear a prosthetic breast and hide beneath baggy jumpers. But then, she realised that she could use her story to help others. Now, she regularly posts online about Poland Syndrome and has ditched her prosthetic.

At the age of just 21, Ripu, from Auckland, New Zealand, contracted the blood infection which resulted in the loss of his nose, upper lip and the amputation of his legs and arms. Ripu could not look in the mirror for a long time and lost a lot of confidence. After 250 days in hospitals and a rehab centre, Ripu adapted to these massive physical changes and has gradually rebuilt his confidence. Now, the 27-year-old has fulfilled his dreams of becoming a journalist and feels his experiences serve him well in this role. While he is smashing life career-wise, Ripu wants to get back into exercise, having not been swimming in years since his rehabilitation sessions. Now, he is ready to get back in the pool and this time, with a friend. Ripu told Truly: \u201cTo come so close to death and emerge as a physically different person and mentally different, in a lot of ways, is a significant change, to put it lightly. And I do feel I've got a second chance in life.\u201d\n\nFollow Ripu here: https://www.instagram.com/ripubhatia/ \n\nVideographer: Kirk Pflaum\nProducers: Emika Berry, James Thorne\nEditor: Akash Beri \n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nRIPU Bhatia feels he has had a second chance at life after surviving meningococcal septicemia. At the age of just 21, Ripu, from Auckland, New Zealand, contracted the blood infection which resulted in the loss of his nose, upper lip and the amputation of his legs and arms. Ripu could not look in the mirror for a long time and lost a lot of confidence. After 250 days in hospitals and a rehab centre, Ripu adapted to these massive physical changes and has gradually rebuilt his confidence. Now, the 27-year-old has fulfilled his dreams of becoming a journalist and feels his experiences serve him well in this role. While he is smashing life career-wise, Ripu wants to get back into exercise, having not been swimming in years since his rehabilitation sessions. Now, he is ready to get back in the pool and this time, with a friend. Ripu told Truly: \u201cTo come so close to death and emerge as a physically different person and mentally different, in a lot of ways, is a significant change, to put it lightly. And I do feel I've got a second chance in life.\u201d\n\nFollow Ripu here: https://www.instagram.com/ripubhatia/ \n\nVideographer: Kirk Pflaum\nProducers: Emika Berry, James Thorne\nEditor: Akash Beri \n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

In order to deal with this chain of heartbreaking events, she turned to food. Renatta told Truly: \"I started using food to comfort myself and to cope.\" She developed a very unhealthy lifestyle, filled with soda, junk food and drive-thru takeaways. At her heaviest Renatta weighed 287lbs. She knew things were spiraling out of control: \"When I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who was just really broken and lost.\" After a spinal surgery, Renatta was given a warning from her doctor that if she didn't start to lose weight, she would need more surgeries in the near future.

In order to deal with this chain of heartbreaking events, she turned to food. Renatta told Truly: \"I started using food to comfort myself and to cope.\" She developed a very unhealthy lifestyle, filled with soda, junk food and drive-thru takeaways. At her heaviest Renatta weighed 287lbs. She knew things were spiraling out of control: \"When I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who was just really broken and lost.\" After a spinal surgery, Renatta was given a warning from her doctor that if she didn't start to lose weight, she would need more surgeries in the near future. Renatta wanted to change but didn't enjoy exercise: \"I did not do much exercise at all, I hated exercise...

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nAMBER Stonelake, from Mountain Home, Arkansas, has been collecting tattoos since she was 20 years old. She has become hooked on getting inked and now has the end goal of having one complete body sleeve. Amber told Truly: \"To me everybody looks the same, I really strive to be different. I don't want to look like anybody else in the world.\" Amber has struggled with self confidence issues, but with each tattoo she gets, the more she feels like her real self. Despite how Amber's look makes her feel, not everybody in the town feels the same way. \"Some of the people are like: 'Why did you mess up your face like that? It looks like scribbles on your face' - that's what automatically goes to their brain.\"  Amber knows that people may have their own opinions, but this won't change her mind about looking exactly the way she wants. \"I don't regret any of my tattoos, I love myself and I love who I am.\" \n\nFollow Amber here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/amber__akashyia/\n\nVideographer: Nathan Johnson\nProducers: Adam Fleet, Ruby Coote \nEditor: Omar Gobere \n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\n25-YEAR-OLD Jenna Bullen from Oklahoma City sustained burns to over 95% of her body at the young age of three. As her parents were getting ready for a Memorial Day celebration, Jenna was in the garage when a knocked-over gasoline canister ignited a flash fire. With her body covered in 3rd and 4th degree burns, Jenna has had to undergo over 80 surgeries throughout her lifetime. During one of these surgeries in 2015, Jenna\u2019s heart stopped beating whilst on the operating table. Jenna told Truly: \u201cIt was very eye-opening for me, I got really depressed and felt like my life was going to be like that forever.\u201d However, the thing that got Jenna back on track, was finding out she was becoming an aunt for the very first time. Jenna said: \u201cMy brother told me that he was going to have a baby and something changed, it gave me motivation to get better.\u201d Now Jenna is weeks away from graduating with her Bachelor\u2019s degree in Psychology. To celebrate the special occasion, she wants to do a photoshoot in the traditional \u201ccap and gown\u201d. Having struggled with her confidence growing up, being in front of the camera is something that Jenna doesn\u2019t do often.

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\n25-YEAR-OLD Jenna Bullen from Oklahoma City sustained burns to over 95% of her body at the young age of three. As her parents were getting ready for a Memorial Day celebration, Jenna was in the garage when a knocked-over gasoline canister ignited a flash fire. With her body covered in 3rd and 4th degree burns, Jenna has had to undergo over 80 surgeries throughout her lifetime. During one of these surgeries in 2015, Jenna\u2019s heart stopped beating whilst on the operating table. Jenna told Truly: \u201cIt was very eye-opening for me, I got really depressed and felt like my life was going to be like that forever.\u201d However, the thing that got Jenna back on track, was finding out she was becoming an aunt for the very first time. Jenna said: \u201cMy brother told me that he was going to have a baby and something changed, it gave me motivation to get better.\u201d Now Jenna is weeks away from graduating with her Bachelor\u2019s degree in Psychology. To celebrate the special occasion, she wants to do a photoshoot in the traditional \u201ccap and gown\u201d. Having struggled with her confidence growing up, being in front of the camera is something that Jenna doesn\u2019t do often. However, she wants to stress that when you come to terms with who you are, you learn how to love yourself. \u201cSeveral years ago, I finally realised it\u2019s okay to be different, you don\u2019t want to look like everybody else.\" \n\nFollow Jenna here - https://www.instagram.com/iamjennabullen/\n\nVideographer: Chris Sinclair\nProducer: Stephanie Stijkel, Ruby Coote\u2002\u2002\nEditor: Milly Silverthorne\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Growing up in Louisiana but now residing in Dallas, Texas, Becky brings her southern charm to everything she does. Big thighs and hips run in the women of Becky's family, and the nickname 'stallion' has been around for years. Becky told Truly: \u201cStallion is southern slang for big and fine! I got the name from guys around the way, always telling me \"I'm built like one\" so it's sorta stuck and here I am today.\" To help her along the way, Becky lives and breathes in her waist trainer to make sure she gets that extra pop in the hips. The main brand Becky works with is a fashion company - which is a blessing as finding clothes to cater for her body shape is a nightmare. Today, they have sent Becky some new outfits she has to promote and we see her work her magic in front of the camera.  \n\nThank you to Trevor for his photography.

Growing up in Louisiana but now residing in Dallas, Texas, Becky brings her southern charm to everything she does. Big thighs and hips run in the women of Becky's family, and the nickname 'stallion' has been around for years. Becky told Truly: \u201cStallion is southern slang for big and fine! I got the name from guys around the way, always telling me \"I'm built like one\" so it's sorta stuck and here I am today.\" To help her along the way, Becky lives and breathes in her waist trainer to make sure she gets that extra pop in the hips. The main brand Becky works with is a fashion company - which is a blessing as finding clothes to cater for her body shape is a nightmare. Today, they have sent Becky some new outfits she has to promote and we see her work her magic in front of the camera.  \n\nThank you to Trevor for his photography.

Karina\u2019s condition means she has to get a seamstress to custom-make her clothes and can only walk short distances. Karina has already had 10 surgeries but her sister Patricia has now found a surgeon willing to remove her largest tumour - but Karina now has to raise the funds needed for the operation, which will leave her hospitalised for six months after the surgery. \n\nDonate to Karina\u2019s fundraising campaign at: \nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/karina-rodini-neurofibromatosis-surgery?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp_guide_do&member=9103438\n\nFollow Karina at:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/superandoaneurofibromatose/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/superandoaneurofibromatose/\n\nVideographer: Luciano Coelho\nProducers: Camile Rocha-Keys, Charles Richards\nEditor: Cecilia Brunell\nPhotographer: Diogo Schechtelv\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

The 26-year-old used to be self-conscious about her height but has now turned it to her advantage, making around $3,000 to $4,000 a month for niche modelling jobs. The model comes from an incredibly tall family (her dad is 6ft 8\", mum is 6ft 3\", while her 21-year-old brother is 7ft 4\" and her younger sister (24) is 6ft 6\") and from a young age Savvy and her siblings were encouraged to celebrate their tall stature rather than hide from it. But as a teenager, Savvy struggled with her appearance. By sixth grade she was 6ft 2\", wearing size 12 shoes and struggling to find clothes to wear like the rest of her peers. Savvy kept growing and was 6ft 7\" by eight grade, reaching her final height of 6ft 8.5\" by age 18. After having to medically retire from her planned basketball career, Savvy has found herself and her 52.5 inch legs embarking on a new career as a model.\n\nFollow Savvy here - \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CH0kZIgJhXe/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@savvy_trapp/video/6865373130366455045 \n\nVideographer / Director: Marius Anderson \nProducer: Nathalie Bonney\nEditor: Cecilia Brunelli, Ruby Coote\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

The 26-year-old used to be self-conscious about her height but has now turned it to her advantage, making around $3,000 to $4,000 a month for niche modelling jobs. The model comes from an incredibly tall family (her dad is 6ft 8\", mum is 6ft 3\", while her 21-year-old brother is 7ft 4\" and her younger sister (24) is 6ft 6\") and from a young age Savvy and her siblings were encouraged to celebrate their tall stature rather than hide from it. But as a teenager, Savvy struggled with her appearance. By sixth grade she was 6ft 2\", wearing size 12 shoes and struggling to find clothes to wear like the rest of her peers. Savvy kept growing and was 6ft 7\" by eight grade, reaching her final height of 6ft 8.5\" by age 18. After having to medically retire from her planned basketball career, Savvy has found herself and her 52.5 inch legs embarking on a new career as a model.\n\nFollow Savvy here - \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CH0kZIgJhXe/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@savvy_trapp/video/6865373130366455045 \n\nVideographer / Director: Marius Anderson \nProducer: Nathalie Bonney\nEditor: Cecilia Brunelli, Ruby Coote\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

She wakes up at 4am each day to start working out, with her routines tailored towards her bum, and she maintains her energy with six meals a day. Vanessa told Truly: \u201cI\u2019m a person who likes a lot of attention so when I started working out and seeing the result, getting bigger and bigger, I wanted it more and more.\" Vanessa\u2019s bum is currently measured around 126cm, but her next goal is 130cm.

Dana says she\u2019s always struggled with her size, but it was during university that Dana gained most of the excess weight. She told Truly: \u201cFood was an addiction to me back then, I was eating 3,500 to 4,000 calories a day.\u201d Dana\u2019s food habits were starting to have an impact on her body, weighing in at 265lbs at her heaviest, she often felt tired and struggled with stomach issues. But it wasn\u2019t until a doctor told her that the excess weight was causing Dana to have high blood pressure, that she realised something had to change. Completely reconstructing her eating and exercise habits, she soon started shedding the extra pounds. Dana shared her journey online, posting updates and tips on her instagram page: \u201cWhen I started with my weight loss journey on social media, I was posting to share with my friends, but then it became a really good way to help out others.\u201d When asked how the transformation affected her life, Dana wants to make clear that it\u2019s not just about the physical changes she\u2019s undergone: \u201cThe greatest part about the transformation is all mental, my mindset is so different, I\u2019m so much more positive, less anxious and much happier.\u201d \n\nFollow Dana - https://www.instagram.com/p/CJrNWOIg1KM/\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Marc-Andre Lavoie\nProducer: Stephanie Stijkel, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Pete Ansell\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\n23-YEAR-OLD Dana Nicole Oswald from Ontario, Canada has lost half of her body weight within a year - losing an incredible 125lbs. Dana says she\u2019s always struggled with her size, but it was during university that Dana gained most of the excess weight. She told Truly: \u201cFood was an addiction to me back then, I was eating 3,500 to 4,000 calories a day.\u201d Dana\u2019s food habits were starting to have an impact on her body, weighing in at 265lbs at her heaviest, she often felt tired and struggled with stomach issues. But it wasn\u2019t until a doctor told her that the excess weight was causing Dana to have high blood pressure, that she realised something had to change. Completely reconstructing her eating and exercise habits, she soon started shedding the extra pounds. Dana shared her journey online, posting updates and tips on her instagram page: \u201cWhen I started with my weight loss journey on social media, I was posting to share with my friends, but then it became a really good way to help out others.\u201d When asked how the transformation affected her life, Dana wants to make clear that it\u2019s not just about the physical changes she\u2019s undergone: \u201cThe greatest part about the transformation is all mental, my mindset is so different, I\u2019m so much more positive, less anxious and much happier.\u201d \n\nFollow Dana - https://www.instagram.com/p/CJrNWOIg1KM/\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Marc-Andre Lavoie\nProducer: Stephanie Stijkel, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Pete Ansell\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Elisane told Truly: \"It still hurts, it was my dream to be a mother and for the doctor to tell me that I lost two, that they were twins, I was in despair.\"\n\nFor more Elisane, follow:\nElisane on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/elisane_oficial/?hl=en\n\nVideographers: Marcio Nagano\nProducers: Giacomo Brunelli, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Reuben Yarwood \nFixer: Marilia Marasciulo\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

She has been married for four years, and her husband Riccardo has never seen her wear anything other than pink. In this video, Sarah is transformed into a style she would usually steer clear of - an Aussie beach babe look, the typical uniform of girls where she lives. \n\nFor more follow:\nSarah: https://Ohsokawaiixoxo.carrd.co\nMake Up Artist: https://www.instagram.com/digital.xai/\nhttps://ahoymedia.com.au ohttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cEbkvuvofXWMS3YcsimQw\n\nVideographer: Aaron Fiora and Brad Gilbertson (Ahoy Media)\nProducers: Kate Moore, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Helen Mckee\nSeries Producers: Charley Sutton, Jon Eastman\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Sarah Guerra, from Adelaide, 34, is obsessed with Kawaii style, a look which started in Japan and is known for being charmingly cute. Her house is fully decorated with pastel colours, stuffed toys and her J-fashion clothes. A whole room is taken up by her wardrobe, which includes a wall of over 100 pairs of shoes. She has been married for four years, and her husband Riccardo has never seen her wear anything other than pink. In this video, Sarah is transformed into a style she would usually steer clear of - an Aussie beach babe look, the typical uniform of girls where she lives. \n\nFor more follow:\nSarah: https://Ohsokawaiixoxo.carrd.co\nMake Up Artist: https://www.instagram.com/digital.xai/\nhttps://ahoymedia.com.au ohttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cEbkvuvofXWMS3YcsimQw\n\nVideographer: Aaron Fiora and Brad Gilbertson (Ahoy Media)\nProducers: Kate Moore, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Helen Mckee\nSeries Producers: Charley Sutton, Jon Eastman\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nTWIN girls Joy and Joyce Magsino are craniopagus conjoined twins from the Philippines - meaning they were born with their skulls fused together. At birth, the doctors gave the twins a 10-year life expectancy, but the now 13 year olds are thriving against the odds. Separating Joy and Joyce is a possibility, but an incredibly risky operation that would cost the family $75,000. Their mother Jhomarie has left the country to work abroad, in an attempt to be able to save enough money to afford the operation. She told Truly: \"When they were younger they were so difficult to look after, unlike today, they can look after themselves - now they can shower, feed themselves and also use TikTok.\" The twins love to record videos for social media, and have been slowly seeing their followers increase. \"We would like to be famous on social media someday so that we can save up some money for our operation,\" Joy said.\n\nFollow their story here:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@magsinotwins5\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxG_xB3cXUk4ueUo--kHxiQ \n\nVideographer: Sherbian Dacalanio \nProducers: Giacomo Brunelli, Alma Enriquez, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Ian Phillips\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nTWIN girls Joy and Joyce Magsino are craniopagus conjoined twins from the Philippines - meaning they were born with their skulls fused together. At birth, the doctors gave the twins a 10-year life expectancy, but the now 13 year olds are thriving against the odds. Separating Joy and Joyce is a possibility, but an incredibly risky operation that would cost the family $75,000. Their mother Jhomarie has left the country to work abroad, in an attempt to be able to save enough money to afford the operation. She told Truly: \"When they were younger they were so difficult to look after, unlike today, they can look after themselves - now they can shower, feed themselves and also use TikTok.\" The twins love to record videos for social media, and have been slowly seeing their followers increase. \"We would like to be famous on social media someday so that we can save up some money for our operation,\" Joy said.\n\nFollow their story here:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@magsinotwins5\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxG_xB3cXUk4ueUo--kHxiQ \n\nVideographer: Sherbian Dacalanio \nProducers: Giacomo Brunelli, Alma Enriquez, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Ian Phillips\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

She told Truly: \u201cI was an anxious eater, whether it was happy or sad, I was binge eating and I didn\u2019t have control over it.\u201d The turning point came on a shopping trip with her cousin, when a rude shop assistant pointed out to Ali she wouldn\u2019t fit a regular dress size and instead should look at the plus size section.

While pink-obsessed Ali has worn the same colour every day since 2016, Josie prefers darker hues, wearing a lot of black and green - although she\u2019s not so mono-colour wearing as her sister. The pair do share a love for Japanese culture and fashion: Ali favouring Kawaii style, which loosely translates to \u2018cute\u2019, and Josie describing herself as a fan of Harajuku Neon.

While pink-obsessed Ali has worn the same colour every day since 2016, Josie prefers darker hues, wearing a lot of black and green - although she\u2019s not so mono-colour wearing as her sister. The pair do share a love for Japanese culture and fashion: Ali favouring Kawaii style, which loosely translates to \u2018cute\u2019, and Josie describing herself as a fan of Harajuku Neon. But what happens when the frills and pastel makeup tones come off and the twins are transformed into Instagram baddies?\n\nVideographer: Taylor Blumel \nProducer: Chloe Sweet, Nathalie Bonney,  Ruby Coote\nEditor: Helen Mckee\nSeries Producers: Jon Eastman, Charley Sutton\n\nFor more follow:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kawaiiconic.ali/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/igiko.pop/\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Paloma Lira from Sao Paulo, Brazil was born with congenital lamellar ichthyosis, a condition which causes the skin to become extremely dry and scaly. The genetic disease has no cure, and Paloma has to have a strict care routine to soothe her skin - especially during the hotter months. When Paloma was a child, she was frequently bullied for her skin condition - however now as an adult she refuses to allow anything to get in her way. She has even had tattoos and frequently tries out different makeup looks. \n\nFollow Paloma here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/palomaflira/\n\nVideographer/Photographer : Marilia Marasciulo, Bruno Oliveira Mazzoco\nProducers: Shannon Lane, James Thorne\nEditor: Ethan Edwards\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

However, his route to success was far from straightforward. The son of a farmer in Gujarat, India Ganesh was initially denied the right to study medicine by the local government and the High Court. Undeterred, Ganesh and his family appealed that decision in the Supreme Court, who finally ordered Ganesh\u2019s admission to the college.

However, his route to success was far from straightforward. The son of a farmer in Gujarat, India Ganesh was initially denied the right to study medicine by the local government and the High Court. Undeterred, Ganesh and his family appealed that decision in the Supreme Court, who finally ordered Ganesh\u2019s admission to the college. Upon graduating, Ganesh hopes to help people who cannot afford medical care.\n\nVideographer: Haziq Qadri\nProducers: Frazer Randalls, James Thorne\nEditor: Sarah Galpin\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\n37-YEAR-OLD Kelly Lynch has two spines as a result of being born with an underdeveloped conjoined twin. The San Francisco based standup comedian explains she was supposed to be a conjoined twin, but her twin did not develop in the womb. As a result, not only does Kelly have two spines, she was also born with a third arm attached to the back of her head and has one eye instead of two. Over time, her two spines have formed a helix shape, which means Kelly has a condition called kyphoscoliosis; an unusual curvage of the spine. The severe scoliosis has most probably resulted in Kelly being only 3ft 10\" tall. The curvage of Kelly\u2019s spine also resulted in pulmonary arterial hypertension, which causes shortness of breath and heart palpitations; she now uses 24/7 breathing support. However, Kelly will not let her severe health issues stand in her way, she tells Truly: \"Initially the doctors told my parents I would not live past a year, and I really showed them! I\u2019m 37 now.\u201d Kelly loves going to gigs with her friends and is building up an impressive following on social media, which she uses for her comedy and disability awareness. Kelly adds: \"I don\u2019t let my disability limit what I love to do.\u201d \n\nFollow Kelly here:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@toolowfrontrow\nhttps://www.instagram.com/toolowfrontrow/ \n\nVideographer: Elie Khadra\nProducers: Stephanie Stijkel, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Ian Phillips\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\n37-YEAR-OLD Kelly Lynch has two spines as a result of being born with an underdeveloped conjoined twin. The San Francisco based standup comedian explains she was supposed to be a conjoined twin, but her twin did not develop in the womb. As a result, not only does Kelly have two spines, she was also born with a third arm attached to the back of her head and has one eye instead of two. Over time, her two spines have formed a helix shape, which means Kelly has a condition called kyphoscoliosis; an unusual curvage of the spine. The severe scoliosis has most probably resulted in Kelly being only 3ft 10\" tall. The curvage of Kelly\u2019s spine also resulted in pulmonary arterial hypertension, which causes shortness of breath and heart palpitations; she now uses 24/7 breathing support. However, Kelly will not let her severe health issues stand in her way, she tells Truly: \"Initially the doctors told my parents I would not live past a year, and I really showed them! I\u2019m 37 now.\u201d Kelly loves going to gigs with her friends and is building up an impressive following on social media, which she uses for her comedy and disability awareness. Kelly adds: \"I don\u2019t let my disability limit what I love to do.\u201d \n\nFollow Kelly here:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@toolowfrontrow\nhttps://www.instagram.com/toolowfrontrow/ \n\nVideographer: Elie Khadra\nProducers: Stephanie Stijkel, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Ian Phillips\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Latif Khatana, from Jammu in India, has suffered from Neurofibromatosis since birth - a condition that causes tumours to grow on nerve tissue. Though Latif's tumours grow all over his body, unfortunately the largest ones are on his face. With both his eyes covered by the large folds of skin, Latif has lost most of his eyesight. After having suffered years of abuse for his condition, Latif is now a happily married father of two. Him and his wife Salima, who was born missing a foot, bonded over their disabilities. However, the parents are still afraid that their daughters might one day start showing signs of Latif's condition. \n\nVideographer: Haziq Qadri\nProducers: Giacomo Brunelli, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Ian Phillips\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA MAN was born with such a severe case of facial tumours that he no longer has a face. Latif Khatana, from Jammu in India, has suffered from Neurofibromatosis since birth - a condition that causes tumours to grow on nerve tissue. Though Latif's tumours grow all over his body, unfortunately the largest ones are on his face. With both his eyes covered by the large folds of skin, Latif has lost most of his eyesight. After having suffered years of abuse for his condition, Latif is now a happily married father of two. Him and his wife Salima, who was born missing a foot, bonded over their disabilities. However, the parents are still afraid that their daughters might one day start showing signs of Latif's condition. \n\nVideographer: Haziq Qadri\nProducers: Giacomo Brunelli, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Ian Phillips\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Ronald Gardiner Jr., who goes by \u2018GPHustla\u2019 online, says he has the world record for the longest ever stream with over 2,700 consecutive hours of live streaming since August 2020. The Rhode Island-native plays a variety of video games but also takes his streaming community with him on his mobile phone when he takes showers and even lets them watch him sleep. Ron, 35, told Truly: \u201cI\u2019m in euphoria when I\u2019m streaming. It helps me forget about my stress. A lot of people wonder \u2018how do you do it with people watching you sleep?\u2019 But everything just feels amazing. I feel I\u2019m where I belong. This is what I should be doing. I feel like I'm going to be 60, 70 years old and still streaming.\u201d\n\nRon can be found on Twitch at: https://www.twitch.tv/gphustla \n\nDirector / videographer: Colin Bell\nProducer: Joe Roberts\nEditor: Ciara Cecil \nEdit producer: Charles Richards\nSeries producer: Dom Smith"

The fitness influencer from Miami, Florida, left college wanting to be a businessman. But found himself getting into personal training when he saw what he could bring to the industry. Using his college football and track training, he helps people slim down but maintain their strength and power.

Colby Van Voorhis, 24, from Georgetown, New York, was born with thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome (TAR) - leaving him with no arm bones and without any knee joints. Colby recently decided to sign up to the video sharing platform, TikTok, and his profile has attracted over 200K followers after videos of him cracking jokes have gone viral. Standing at 4ft 1\", Colby didn\u2019t let his rare condition, which affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 births, define him - and has instead started embracing the things that set him apart. \n\nColby's TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@armlessfreak\n\nVideographer: Marcus Cooper\nProducers: Rafaela Kuznec\nEditors: Beth Angus, Ruby Coote\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

After constant binge eating and takeaways, Jen Atkin saw her weight rise to 247lbs. The 27-year-old from Grimsby, UK, felt like she was in a vicious circle.

Justin, 19, from New Jersey, was born without a fully formed nose due to a form of cleft, known as frontonasal dysplasia, a rare condition with around 100 estimated cases reported. But due to his unique difference, Justin was recently signed by New York-based agency 'We Speak Model Management' that represents models of all sizes, ages, and backgrounds. Justin was approached by the agency this year when the facial differences advocate started posting pictures of himself on Instagram to raise awareness of cleft and frontonasal dysplasia. \n\nFollow Justin here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/_justinstewart/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/smiling.within/\n\nVideographer: Marcus Cooper\nProducers: Rafaela Kuznec, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Shiona Penrake\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Oliver and Harry Beswick, aged 15, are fraternal twins from Stoke-On-Trent. The boys were born two months premature, weighing only three pounds each. Harry was born with Goldenhar Syndrome, a rare congenital defect which meant he was born with no features on the left-hand side of his face. Harry was also diagnosed with autism and has the functioning skills of a 4-year-old. Their mum, Charlie, told Truly: \u201cThe biggest thing my boys have taught me is there\u2019s no such thing as perfect and imperfectly perfect is good enough.\u201d\n\nFollow Oliver and Harry here: https://www.instagram.com/ouralteredlife/\n\nVideographer: Scott Dulson\nProducers: Martha Hewett, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Cecilia Brunelli\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Tyler Dyvig got hooked on changing his look at such a young age and loved being the centre of attention as he showcased his new looks. One main reason why Tyler started getting work done at such a young age is because he would hear his Mum\u2019s dermatologist recommend that if you start at a young age, it would help break down the muscle, and once that muscle breaks down, you won\u2019t get wrinkles. To date, Tyler has spent about $75,000 on procedures and had multiple rounds of laser treatments, bicep implants, buttock augmentation, his chin and jaw done three times, his lips done three times a year and will soon get a hair transplant.\n\nFollow Tyler here: https://www.instagram.com/tylerkd97/\n\nVideographer / Director: Heath Franklin\nProducer: Dav Rich, James Thorne\nEditor: Helen Mckee\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Tyler Dyvig got hooked on changing his look at such a young age and loved being the centre of attention as he showcased his new looks. One main reason why Tyler started getting work done at such a young age is because he would hear his Mum\u2019s dermatologist recommend that if you start at a young age, it would help break down the muscle, and once that muscle breaks down, you won\u2019t get wrinkles. To date, Tyler has spent about $75,000 on procedures and had multiple rounds of laser treatments, bicep implants, buttock augmentation, his chin and jaw done three times, his lips done three times a year and will soon get a hair transplant.\n\nFollow Tyler here: https://www.instagram.com/tylerkd97/\n\nVideographer / Director: Heath Franklin\nProducer: Dav Rich, James Thorne\nEditor: Helen Mckee\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

For the last two years, Andriadi has found it very difficult to walk and was in pain on a daily basis. Residing in Medan, Indonesia, Truly filmed a documentary with Andriadi in May 2020 and since this film went viral online, the local Accu Plast Hospital has offered him free surgery. Andriadi and his family were unable to fund the necessary treatment before this point\u2026 But he now faces the most nerve-racking operation of his life.

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA MAN who was living with 30 kilograms of tumours hanging from his body has finally been offered surgery \u2013 thanks to his first documentary with Truly going viral. 34-year-old Andriadi, was born with a rare genetic disorder called Neurofibromatosis that caused mass tumours to form on his nerve tissues. For the last two years, Andriadi has found it very difficult to walk and was in pain on a daily basis. Residing in Medan, Indonesia, Truly filmed a documentary with Andriadi in May 2020 and since this film went viral online, the local Accu Plast Hospital has offered him free surgery. Andriadi and his family were unable to fund the necessary treatment before this point\u2026 But he now faces the most nerve-racking operation of his life. With such a high risk of danger attached to the complex procedure, will Andriadi pull through?\n\nVideographer: Jefri Tarigan\nProducers: Danny Baggott, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Thom Johnson\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nONCE known as the heaviest child in the world, Arya Permana, from Karawang, West Java, Indonesia is now an active teenager who likes to play badminton with his school friends. Arya weighed 423lbs (over 30 stone) at his heaviest and struggled to do simple activities like walk down the road to school or even take a bath. The 14-year-old lost an incredible 220lbs after having weight loss surgery. But while the teenager is now able to lead a much more active life, he has been left with excess skin on his chest, stomach, back and arms. The skin on his arms in particular left Arya embarrassed and he would try to cover it up with long shirts. It also meant when he did participate in sports the excess skin would rub and irritate him. The teenager underwent the first of at least four more planned surgeries at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung in July 2019, to reduce the excess skin on his arms. He hopes to return for further skin removal surgeries in the future \u2013 although with the COVID-19 pandemic it\u2019s not confirmed when he will be able to have the subsequent surgeries.\n\nVideographer: Jefri Tarrigan\nProducers: Nathalie Bonney, James Thorne\nEditor: Cecilia Brunelli\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nONCE known as the heaviest child in the world, Arya Permana, from Karawang, West Java, Indonesia is now an active teenager who likes to play badminton with his school friends. Arya weighed 423lbs (over 30 stone) at his heaviest and struggled to do simple activities like walk down the road to school or even take a bath. The 14-year-old lost an incredible 220lbs after having weight loss surgery. But while the teenager is now able to lead a much more active life, he has been left with excess skin on his chest, stomach, back and arms. The skin on his arms in particular left Arya embarrassed and he would try to cover it up with long shirts. It also meant when he did participate in sports the excess skin would rub and irritate him. The teenager underwent the first of at least four more planned surgeries at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung in July 2019, to reduce the excess skin on his arms. He hopes to return for further skin removal surgeries in the future \u2013 although with the COVID-19 pandemic it\u2019s not confirmed when he will be able to have the subsequent surgeries.\n\nVideographer: Jefri Tarrigan\nProducers: Nathalie Bonney, James Thorne\nEditor: Cecilia Brunelli\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

At his heaviest, he weighed 330lbs and after \u2018too many rejections\u2019 from girls he decided to diet and exercise the pounds off. Mark, 38, of St Albans, dropped 112lbs in 10 months, however, he did not tackle the root of the problem - his mental health. By the age of 28, the weight had crept back on after Mark turned to food and excessive drinking, telling himself he was not good enough. With the help of therapy as well as a nutritional diet and exercise, he lost a total of 140lbs. Mark thought this would help him find love but the initial euphoria of being \u2018shredded\u2019 wore off. Mark now weighs 195lbs and says he is living a more balanced life. He qualified as a personal trainer and life coach to help others on their fitness journeys. In May 2017 Mark met Zo\u00eb, 32, and the couple are now planning their wedding.\nFor more info on Mark's journey, visit:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/transformationmark/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/transformationmark/\n\nVideographer / Director: Mark Ludlow / Z\u00f6e Bowman\nProducer: Emika Berry\nEditor: James Thorne\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

At his heaviest, he weighed 330lbs and after \u2018too many rejections\u2019 from girls he decided to diet and exercise the pounds off. Mark, 38, of St Albans, dropped 112lbs in 10 months, however, he did not tackle the root of the problem - his mental health. By the age of 28, the weight had crept back on after Mark turned to food and excessive drinking, telling himself he was not good enough. With the help of therapy as well as a nutritional diet and exercise, he lost a total of 140lbs. Mark thought this would help him find love but the initial euphoria of being \u2018shredded\u2019 wore off. Mark now weighs 195lbs and says he is living a more balanced life. He qualified as a personal trainer and life coach to help others on their fitness journeys. In May 2017 Mark met Zo\u00eb, 32, and the couple are now planning their wedding.\nFor more info on Mark's journey, visit:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/transformationmark/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/transformationmark/\n\nVideographer / Director: Mark Ludlow / Z\u00f6e Bowman\nProducer: Emika Berry\nEditor: James Thorne\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Her vitiligo first showed around her eye when she was five, but accelerated when she was 11, spreading over her arms, legs and face. Growing up Deborah was on the receiving end of cruel taunts from bullies, with children calling her a \"cow\", \"zebra\" and \"monster\".

But there has always been something missing for Roddy - he began to realise that he did not want to be a 'Ken doll' look alike after all. He wanted to transition and become a woman. To this day, Roddy wishes to be referred to and known as \u2018Roddy\u2019 and \u2018he\u2019 until he has fully completed his transition journey.\n\nVideographer / Director: Sam Miles\nPhotographer: Thomas Evans - http://www.thomasevansphotography.com/\nProducer: Dav Rich / Chloe Sweet\nEditor: Beth Angus\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Jeyza, 21, from Fayetteville, North Carolina, has a rare genetic skin condition called lamellar ichthyosis which causes her skin to shed every 10 to 12 days, creating a scale-like texture. But Jeyza says she looks at herself as a \"victor not a victim\" and has been wowing casting agents, winning big commissions with national brands like Target. In this film we see Jeyza in New York during fashion week for a shoot with Glamour UK - the first shoot she has produced herself. We see Jeyza working with a team of creatives to bring her 70s inspired vision to reality. \n\nTo see more of Jeyza in action visit: https://www.instagram.com/lyricallydiverse/\n \nGlamour shoot photographs courtesy of Sophie Kietzmann: https://www.instagram.com/sophiekietzmann/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nVideographer: Marcus Cooper\nProducer: Tom Midlane, Stephanie Stijkel, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Shiona Penrake\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "Model Jeyza Gary is redefining public perceptions of beauty while making waves in the fashion world with her unique look. Jeyza, 21, from Fayetteville, North Carolina, has a rare genetic skin condition called lamellar ichthyosis which causes her skin to shed every 10 to 12 days, creating a scale-like texture. But Jeyza says she looks at herself as a \"victor not a victim\" and has been wowing casting agents, winning big commissions with national brands like Target. In this film we see Jeyza in New York during fashion week for a shoot with Glamour UK - the first shoot she has produced herself. We see Jeyza working with a team of creatives to bring her 70s inspired vision to reality. \n\nTo see more of Jeyza in action visit: https://www.instagram.com/lyricallydiverse/\n \nGlamour shoot photographs courtesy of Sophie Kietzmann: https://www.instagram.com/sophiekietzmann/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nVideographer: Marcus Cooper\nProducer: Tom Midlane, Stephanie Stijkel, Kim Nguyen\nEditor: Shiona Penrake\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA YOUNG woman who was told by a stranger that she looked like she'd been \"mauled by a gorilla\" due to her rare skin condition has had the last laugh - by being invited to model for Vogue. Lucy Beall, 21, originally from Texas but now a student at University of St Andrews in Scotland, has recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB), meaning any friction against her skin can cause it to shed, leaving painful blisters and wounds. Lucy's condition means she even needs to be careful when brushing her teeth or eating, with scar tissue forming where food grazes her throat. Her most recent operation involved having skin from her leg grafted on to her hands to try and resolve the 'mittening' caused by excessive scar tissue, which had rendered her right hand unuseable. Growing up she would hide her body, with total strangers asking her if she had been in a \"horrific accident\" or \"mauled by a gorilla\". Lucy said: \u201cI can\u2019t count the amount of times I\u2019ve been told to my face or behind my back that I\u2019d be hot if it weren\u2019t for my scars, or have been referred to as 'the girl with the scars' as though they were my only defining feature and negate all other aspects of my appearance or personality.\" As well as being an art history and classics student, a disability advocate and an author, Lucy also models in order to raise awareness of her condition and show that disability doesn't have to stand in the way of beauty - and was thrilled to be invited by Vogue Italia to feature in Fantabody\u2019s \u201cI AM THE WOMAN I AM\u201d campaign.\n\nFantabody/Vogue Italia photographs courtesy of Guen Fiore: https://www.instagram.com/guenfiore/\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Rory Dunning, Fergus Thom\nProducer: Tom Midlane, Stephanie Stijkel\nEditor: Beth Angus\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA YOUNG woman who was told by a stranger that she looked like she'd been \"mauled by a gorilla\" due to her rare skin condition has had the last laugh - by being invited to model for Vogue. Lucy Beall, 21, originally from Texas but now a student at University of St Andrews in Scotland, has recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB), meaning any friction against her skin can cause it to shed, leaving painful blisters and wounds. Lucy's condition means she even needs to be careful when brushing her teeth or eating, with scar tissue forming where food grazes her throat. Her most recent operation involved having skin from her leg grafted on to her hands to try and resolve the 'mittening' caused by excessive scar tissue, which had rendered her right hand unuseable. Growing up she would hide her body, with total strangers asking her if she had been in a \"horrific accident\" or \"mauled by a gorilla\". Lucy said: \u201cI can\u2019t count the amount of times I\u2019ve been told to my face or behind my back that I\u2019d be hot if it weren\u2019t for my scars, or have been referred to as 'the girl with the scars' as though they were my only defining feature and negate all other aspects of my appearance or personality.\" As well as being an art history and classics student, a disability advocate and an author, Lucy also models in order to raise awareness of her condition and show that disability doesn't have to stand in the way of beauty - and was thrilled to be invited by Vogue Italia to feature in Fantabody\u2019s \u201cI AM THE WOMAN I AM\u201d campaign.\n\nFantabody/Vogue Italia photographs courtesy of Guen Fiore: https://www.instagram.com/guenfiore/\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Rory Dunning, Fergus Thom\nProducer: Tom Midlane, Stephanie Stijkel\nEditor: Beth Angus\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Corey Hyland says she can only ever remember being overweight. By the time she was a teenager Corey had been declared morbidly obese by doctors and she stopped looking at the weighing scales. As a result, Corey doesn\u2019t know her heaviest weight, other than it was in the 400lb range. A decade ago, without ever imagining she would be able to transform her body, Corey decided to make changes to her diet to try and lose some weight. Despite dropping some pounds, Corey had setbacks along the way and says the big change only happened a few years ago when she started working out with a personal trainer. And in the last year, she lost the biggest amount of weight: an incredible 100lbs. But with that dramatic weight loss came a large amount of excess skin that left Corey feeling underwhelmed with what her body now looked like. Having excess skin removal surgery was the final reward.\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Marcus Cooper \nProducer: Nathalie Bonney, James Thorne   \nEditor: James Thorne\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Barcroft shows on Instagram! \nBarcroft TV - https://www.instagram.com/barcroft_tv/\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Barcroft TV: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA WOMAN declared morbidly obese has lost 250lbs and had 10lbs of excess skin removed. Corey Hyland says she can only ever remember being overweight. By the time she was a teenager Corey had been declared morbidly obese by doctors and she stopped looking at the weighing scales. As a result, Corey doesn\u2019t know her heaviest weight, other than it was in the 400lb range. A decade ago, without ever imagining she would be able to transform her body, Corey decided to make changes to her diet to try and lose some weight. Despite dropping some pounds, Corey had setbacks along the way and says the big change only happened a few years ago when she started working out with a personal trainer. And in the last year, she lost the biggest amount of weight: an incredible 100lbs. But with that dramatic weight loss came a large amount of excess skin that left Corey feeling underwhelmed with what her body now looked like. Having excess skin removal surgery was the final reward.\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Marcus Cooper \nProducer: Nathalie Bonney, James Thorne   \nEditor: James Thorne\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Barcroft shows on Instagram! \nBarcroft TV - https://www.instagram.com/barcroft_tv/\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Jlissa Austin, 31, stands at 3\u20194\u201d and was born without arms, knees and with only seven toes. Chassidy Young, 32, lives with Tetra-Amelia syndrome \u2013 also 3\u20194\u201d, she was born with a rare congenital disorder that has left her without hands and with very short legs. Both women filmed documentaries for Barcroft TV\u2019s \u2018Born Different\u2019 series earlier this year, and after watching each other\u2019s life story, they have since become best friends through their very rare similarities. With their friendship going from strength to strength, they have now met in person for the very first time with Chassidy travelling across state from her home in Dallas Texas, to Jlissa who lives in Houston. Neither of them had ever met anyone like themselves before and Barcroft TV was there to capture the emotional moment on camera.\n\nFollow their story here:\nJlissa:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/channel/UC1rDZ8OjyxKbON8R2SWAy_w\nhttps://www.instagram.com/queenjae__world/\n \nChassidy: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/chasing_chassidy/\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Edward Sanchez\nProducer: Danny Baggott, Ruby Coote   \nEditor: Florence Kennard\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Barcroft shows on Instagram! \nBarcroft TV - https://www.instagram.com/barcroft_tv/\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Jlissa Austin, 31, stands at 3\u20194\u201d and was born without arms, knees and with only seven toes. Chassidy Young, 32, lives with Tetra-Amelia syndrome \u2013 also 3\u20194\u201d, she was born with a rare congenital disorder that has left her without hands and with very short legs. Both women filmed documentaries for Barcroft TV\u2019s \u2018Born Different\u2019 series earlier this year, and after watching each other\u2019s life story, they have since become best friends through their very rare similarities. With their friendship going from strength to strength, they have now met in person for the very first time with Chassidy travelling across state from her home in Dallas Texas, to Jlissa who lives in Houston. Neither of them had ever met anyone like themselves before and Barcroft TV was there to capture the emotional moment on camera.\n\nFollow their story here:\nJlissa:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/channel/UC1rDZ8OjyxKbON8R2SWAy_w\nhttps://www.instagram.com/queenjae__world/\n \nChassidy: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/chasing_chassidy/\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Edward Sanchez\nProducer: Danny Baggott, Ruby Coote   \nEditor: Florence Kennard\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Barcroft shows on Instagram! \nBarcroft TV - https://www.instagram.com/barcroft_tv/\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

And now, for the first time, we\u2019ve collecting some of the most inspiring stories into one special documentary. We meet siblings Michiel and Amber Vandeweert, aged 20 and 12 respectively, who love go-karting and dancing; and Challi Muguira, 30, and Tiffany Wedekind, 41, who are two of the oldest survivors with the condition. And last, but most definitely not least, we revisit one of our most popular ever characters, 11-year-old Adalia Rose who is so popular on YouTube that she\u2019s amassed over two million subscribers. Amazing people that we are proud to feature - we hope you enjoy watching these wonderful, inspiring films as much as we enjoyed making them.  \n\nClick here to follow your favourite Barcroft shows on Instagram! \nBarcroft TV - https://www.instagram.com/barcroft_tv/\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeast Buddies - https://www.instagram.com/beastbuddiesshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nSnapped In The Wild - https://www.instagram.com/snappedinthewild/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

And now, for the first time, we\u2019ve collecting some of the most inspiring stories into one special documentary. We meet siblings Michiel and Amber Vandeweert, aged 20 and 12 respectively, who love go-karting and dancing; and Challi Muguira, 30, and Tiffany Wedekind, 41, who are two of the oldest survivors with the condition. And last, but most definitely not least, we revisit one of our most popular ever characters, 11-year-old Adalia Rose who is so popular on YouTube that she\u2019s amassed over two million subscribers. Amazing people that we are proud to feature - we hope you enjoy watching these wonderful, inspiring films as much as we enjoyed making them.  \n\nClick here to follow your favourite Barcroft shows on Instagram! \nBarcroft TV - https://www.instagram.com/barcroft_tv/\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nBeast Buddies - https://www.instagram.com/beastbuddiesshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nSnapped In The Wild - https://www.instagram.com/snappedinthewild/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured"

Fatima Timbo, from Kent, UK, has the most common form of dwarfism, called achondroplasia that affects around 250,000 people worldwide. Fatima started modelling in 2017 and has since gained more than 38,000 followers on Instagram. The 22-year-old was intensively bullied while in high school but says that in the last couple of years her confidence has soared, and she no longer cares about negative comments. Instead, the young woman embraces her condition and helps to inspire others to feel comfortable in their own skin.

Fatima Timbo, from Kent, UK, has the most common form of dwarfism, called achondroplasia that affects around 250,000 people worldwide. Fatima started modelling in 2017 and has since gained more than 38,000 followers on Instagram. The 22-year-old was intensively bullied while in high school but says that in the last couple of years her confidence has soared, and she no longer cares about negative comments. Instead, the young woman embraces her condition and helps to inspire others to feel comfortable in their own skin.

Primarily known for his love of plastic surgery, Rodrigo Alves says he will spend 2019 focusing on launching a singing career - and has even set his sights on entering the Eurovision contest. Also known as the human Ken doll, Rodrigo has started signing lessons with vocal coach Laura Pesenti in Milan, Italy. During his time in the Italian style capital Rodrigo has also been getting into the festive spirit with some shoe shopping, making pizza for his friends  - and of course finding time for a little cosmetic procedure: this time a Brazilian butt lift. \n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Matteo Terzaghi\nProducer: Nathalie Bonney, James Thorne   \nEditor: James Thorne\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftTV on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Barcroft TV: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nHUMAN Ken doll Rodrigo Alves celebrates Christmas in Milan, by buying pairs of designer shoes for his friends and taking singing lessons for his budding singing career. Primarily known for his love of plastic surgery, Rodrigo Alves says he will spend 2019 focusing on launching a singing career - and has even set his sights on entering the Eurovision contest. Also known as the human Ken doll, Rodrigo has started signing lessons with vocal coach Laura Pesenti in Milan, Italy. During his time in the Italian style capital Rodrigo has also been getting into the festive spirit with some shoe shopping, making pizza for his friends  - and of course finding time for a little cosmetic procedure: this time a Brazilian butt lift. \n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Matteo Terzaghi\nProducer: Nathalie Bonney, James Thorne   \nEditor: James Thorne\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftTV on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en"

At one point, John Allaire was so morbidly obese he wore 8XL shirts and had to be weighed on a commercial scale at a fish market, as standard scales would not hold his weight. But after joining a fitness programme and dropping from 540 pounds to a lean 230 lbs, the 27-year-old was left with severe excess skin. John underwent skin removal surgery in March which saw the bulk of the loose skin on his torso and arms removed \u2013 but will require further surgery in the future to remove the skin on his lower body.\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Alexis Duran\nProducer: Joe Roberts, Ruby Coote  \nEditor: Sonia Estal\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftTV on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en",

At one point, John Allaire was so morbidly obese he wore 8XL shirts and had to be weighed on a commercial scale at a fish market, as standard scales would not hold his weight. But after joining a fitness programme and dropping from 540 pounds to a lean 230 lbs, the 27-year-old was left with severe excess skin. John underwent skin removal surgery in March which saw the bulk of the loose skin on his torso and arms removed \u2013 but will require further surgery in the future to remove the skin on his lower body.\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Alexis Duran\nProducer: Joe Roberts, Ruby Coote  \nEditor: Sonia Estal\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftTV on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en"

                "description": "AN AMATEUR sleuth turned private detective has devoted her life to cracking unsolved crimes after helping to track down the killer of her college friend 26 years after her death. Sheila Wysocki, 55, who now lives in Tennessee, met Angela Samota - who went by the name \u201cAngie\u201d - at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas, Texas, in 1982. Despite being very different personalities, the pair quickly became inseparable, but Sheila\u2019s life changed forever, aged 22, when she got a call from one of Angela\u2019s sorority sisters saying Angela had been brutally raped and murdered in her own home. The case quickly went cold, and Sheila left college and moved back home, eventually meeting her husband and starting a family. But in 2004 she had a vision of her murdered friend and, unable to convince local police to reopen the case, trained as a private detective, qualifying in 2005. By 2006 her persistence paid off, and Dallas police tasked detective Linda Crumb with reopening the case, including sending off the DNA found at the scene for analysis, and they found a match with Donald Andrew Bess, a convicted rapist serving a life sentence at Huntsville Prison in Texas. In 2010 he was convicted of Angie\u2019s murder and sentenced to death - it was the only cold case solved in Dallas that year. Sheila set up her own agency in 2011 and has helped many other families who have been chasing justice in cases that have gone unsolved. In 2016, Bess unsuccessfully appealed against the death penalty, but was unsuccessful, and he remains on death row. \n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Zack Wilson \nProducer: Jack McKay, Nora Hakramaj \nEditor: Jack Stevens\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Barcroft TV: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftTV on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en",

As well as using extreme lengths to bulk up to a combined weight of 241kg, the brothers from Rio, Brazil, attend the same gym everyday and work out together for hours to improve their definition. Tony, 49, and Alvaro, 50, claim there was a time when they were \u2018addicted to getting big\u2019 but now believe they have it under control. Alvaro had been injecting his biceps and legs with a supplement - called Potenay B12 - on and off since he was 15 years old. Tony followed in his older brother\u2019s footsteps. Taking their doctors advice, the brothers claim to have recently stopped injecting for health reasons and because their skin cannot stretch anymore. \n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Kadeh Ferreira\nProducer: Danny Baggott, James Thorne\nEditor: James Thorne\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftTV on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en",

As well as using extreme lengths to bulk up to a combined weight of 241kg, the brothers from Rio, Brazil, attend the same gym everyday and work out together for hours to improve their definition. Tony, 49, and Alvaro, 50, claim there was a time when they were \u2018addicted to getting big\u2019 but now believe they have it under control. Alvaro had been injecting his biceps and legs with a supplement - called Potenay B12 - on and off since he was 15 years old. Tony followed in his older brother\u2019s footsteps. Taking their doctors advice, the brothers claim to have recently stopped injecting for health reasons and because their skin cannot stretch anymore. \n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Kadeh Ferreira\nProducer: Danny Baggott, James Thorne\nEditor: James Thorne\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftTV on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en"

But rather than trying to lose weight, the 27-year-old, from Fort Worth, Texas, wants to continue to pile on the pounds \u2013 to the point where she is completely immobile. Monica, who models on Super Sized Big Beautiful Woman websites, is aiming to become the fattest woman in the world at 1000lbs \u2013 and wants to be so huge that she is literally bed-bound. Her feeder boyfriend, Sid Riley, 25, spends his days cooking for Monica, rolling her over when her 91-inch stomach is full and funnel feeding her through a tube.\n\nFor more information, follow Monica on:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/purplewings919/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/PurpleWings919\n\nVideographer / director: Ruaridh Connellan\nProducer: Emma Pearson, Ellie Winstanley\nEditor: Marcus Cooper\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\nBear Grylls Adventure: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzcUNwS7mypzPhW4gsjO7og/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike BARCROFT TV on Facebook: https://www.Facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos"

Li Huanme found her daughter, Likun, 16 years ago in the hallway of the hospital in Shanxi Province, north China, while working as a cleaner. Fearing the tiny baby would die, Li Huanme took Likun home and she and her husband, Zhao Yuchun, have cared for the child ever since. They feed Likun, who has cerebral palsy, by chewing her hot food and transferring it from their own mouth into hers. Likun eats three meals per day, each with a feeding time of around two hours. But despite the time-consuming routine, the couple, who also have two older children, have pledged never to abandon their adopted daughter. \n\nVideographer / director: Luo Xiang\nProducer: Shannon Lane, Ellie Winstanley\nEditor: Marcus Cooper\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\nBear Grylls Adventure: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzcUNwS7mypzPhW4gsjO7og/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike BARCROFT TV on Facebook: https://www.Facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos",

                    "description": "SUBSCRIBE to the Barcroft network: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nA DEDICATED couple have raised an abandoned disabled child, keeping her alive by feeding her mouth-to-mouth like a bird. Li Huanme found her daughter, Likun, 16 years ago in the hallway of the hospital in Shanxi Province, north China, while working as a cleaner. Fearing the tiny baby would die, Li Huanme took Likun home and she and her husband, Zhao Yuchun, have cared for the child ever since. They feed Likun, who has cerebral palsy, by chewing her hot food and transferring it from their own mouth into hers. Likun eats three meals per day, each with a feeding time of around two hours. But despite the time-consuming routine, the couple, who also have two older children, have pledged never to abandon their adopted daughter. \n\nVideographer / director: Luo Xiang\nProducer: Shannon Lane, Ellie Winstanley\nEditor: Marcus Cooper\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\nBear Grylls Adventure: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzcUNwS7mypzPhW4gsjO7og/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike BARCROFT TV on Facebook: https://www.Facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos"

The seven-year-old sisters, from Thailand, were born with their own heads, torsos, and arms but are connected at the waist. The duo share a pair of legs, with Pin having control of one and Pan controlling the other, and have learned to walk, dress, eat - and even ride a tricycle - as one. The twins live in Nakhon Sawan, around 250km north of Bangkok, with their grandparents - who describe them as \u201cnormal, happy\" children.\n\nVideographer / director: Dario Pignatelli\nProducer: Tom Midlane, Nick Johnson\nEditor: Joshua Douglas\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\nBear Grylls Adventure: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzcUNwS7mypzPhW4gsjO7og/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike BARCROFT TV on Facebook: https://www.Facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos"
