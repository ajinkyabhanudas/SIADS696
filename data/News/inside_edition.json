His 61st homer would tie the American League record set by Roger Maris. What makes Durante's mission so special is that his father caught Maris' home run ball 61 years ago. Inside the packed stadium, fans were holding their breath in anticipation. However, Judge fell short of hitting his 61st home run by just a few feet."

Reports say at least 25 people were in a building when it collapsed in Amman on September 13. Rescuers dug through the rubble for more than 80 hours looking for survivors. Days later when the search was called off, 10 people had been found injured and 14 had perished. Baby Malak was one of the lucky ones, according to the country\u2019s Civil Defense.

When the facility shut down last July, all the pups were sent to animal shelters across the nation by the Humane Society of the United States. Now, all of those beagles finally have homes. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry adopted one of the beagles, who's a happy camper at their California estate. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and his wife, Tammy, also adopted one of the beagles named Morty."

Chris and his fianc\u00e9e went to their neighbor's home for help. Rachel Mowry and her husband, Christopher, performed non-stop CPR compressions for 14 minutes until he had a pulse. But then the 53-year-old's heart stopped again two minutes later. Miraculously, they brought him back from the dead for a second time."

From meetings to photo ops, the corgis were always by her side. It all started with a corgi puppy named Susan that was gifted to the queen on her 18th birthday. The lucky dog even tagged along on her honeymoon with Prince Philip. She went on to own more than 30 dogs during her reign. Queen Elizabeth left behind four dogs, where they\u2019ll end up has yet to be known."

Inside the smashed vehicle were 2-year-old twins strapped into their car seats, along with their mom and grandma. The little girl, Melanie Resendiz, survived, but her brother Nicolas Resendiz was crushed to death. The horrific crash happened three weeks ago in Houston. Police have not filed charges and say the driver is distraught and cooperating with the investigation."

In 2011, Ellen Greenberg was found dead by her fianc\u00e9 at their apartment in Philadelphia. She had ten stab wounds on the back of her neck, eight on her chest, one on her abdomen and another one on her scalp. Greenberg's death was at first ruled a homicide but was later changed to suicide. Her parents have spent the last 11 years fighting that ruling."

More than 30 rescuers worked through the night to get the boy out. Time was of the essence because borewell tunnels typically have low oxygen levels, making survival rare. In the end, it took 102 hours, but Rahul is alive and has been reunited with his family."

Nearly two-dozen people worked together to lift the vehicle off James, as he was pulled to safety. Afterwards, James took to Facebook to express his gratitude."

But while the jury is still hearing evidence, some members of the public may already have reached a verdict.

Kiara and Joel Brokenbrough told Inside Edition how they got married in a public park, and Kiara made all the invitations herself. The flowers were gifted by her godmother, and her mom, a pastor, married them. It was no small affair, with 40 guests who were invited to a reception at a restaurant and who picked up their own individual tabs."

Many are calling the apparent murders of civilians by Russian troops war crimes. Russia is claiming that the grim scenes were staged, but CBS News correspondent Debora Patta, who witnessed these horrors, said that it would be \u201cimpossible to stage\u201d such gruesome scenes. Satellite images taken two weeks ago, before Russian troops withdrew, show bodies in the streets."

American parents Paula and Joey Reed find themselves personally at Putin\u2019s mercy. Their son Trevor was visiting his girlfriend in Russia in 2019 when he was accused of assaulting a police officer after a night of drinking. He was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in a labor camp. His parents say there is video that proves he didn\u2019t assault the cop."

The asteroid they\u2019re testing it on is 7 million miles away, and is not a danger to our planet."

He was so incensed that he followed the alleged shoplifter out of the store, giving a running commentary. He sent the video to the city\u2019s new mayor, Eric Adams."

The disaster happened after torrential rain lifted the home off its foundation and sent it sliding. James and Didi Fritts were trapped in the debris. Adding to their nightmare, they were unsure what happened to their two Labrador retrievers. Nearly a week after the collapse, the couple returned to what was left of their home in search of their dogs."

He ran for days until the Arizona Humane Society and Phoenix Firefighters used a humane trap \u2014 and food \u2014 to lure him out. Animal Hospital staff say the kitten was underweight, had fleas and some stomach issues. It will take a couple of weeks to get him ready to go to his new home. When he\u2019s strong enough to leave the hospital, this furball is headed for the residence of one of the firefighters who rescued him."

But after years of plummeting ratings, this year\u2019s 100th anniversary show didn\u2019t even air on broadcast TV. Instead, viewers streamed it on NBC\u2019s Peacock, and the reviews were pretty bad. \u201cCringey,\u201d and \u201ca mess,\u201d posted disappointed fans. Many credit the competition\u2019s downfall to ditching the swimsuit competition in 2018, and turning it into a scholarship contest rather than a beauty pageant."

Cibo says his food murals are meant to combat the rise in extremism, and to inspire others to use their talents to better their communities."

After heavy rains in Port Orange, a car ran off the road and into a canal. Ordinary citizens tried to help the woman trapped in the car until police could arrive.

Inside Edition Digital\u2019s Mara Montalbano has more."

Nina Angelo and her boyfriend, Matt Englad, say that they could \u201cfeel\u201d his temper as they watched the scene unfold. The incident reportedly took place on August 27, two weeks after their notorious run-in with the police after a fight, and just before authorities believe Gabby was killed."

Dolly appeared on the cover of Playboy back in 1978, and vowed to do another cover when she turned 75. But now that she is 75, there\u2019s no more Playboy Magazine. But she put on the vintage bunny outfit anyway, proving she\u2019s still got it!"

The nightmare started when the little girl was riding her bicycle outside her home. Out of nowhere, cops say the suspect pulled over and grabbed her. Then, he threw her into his car and drove off. Luckily, a neighbor got a partial license plate and called 911. An entire police division, some 13 cars, was put on the manhunt. #InsideEdition"

The crew of an icebreaker near the Arctic noticed the fluffy white pup, stranded on some sea ice. They lowered a ladder and called to her. The canine came in from the cold, and warmed up aboard the ship. The crew then called around, and were able to locate her owner. The dog -- a 1-year-old named Aika -- had wandered off from a Russian town near the Arctic Circle the week before. #InsideEdition"

He then fell into an unconventional friendship with greats like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dave Draper and Zabo Koszewski.

Dr. Marie Harper and her family found themselves dealing with rolling power outages and no running water because of snow and ice storms in Shreveport, Louisiana. In order to bathe her five children, ages 6 and under, Harper melted snow in a pot used for crawfish boils, and dropped her kids in one at a time!

Joe DiMeo, who lives in New Jersey, underwent the procedure in August after burning 80% of his body in a horrific car crash in 2018. Although DiMeo isn\u2019t out of the woods and will be on medication for the rest of his life to make sure his body doesn\u2019t reject the transplants, experts at NYU Langone, where the surgery took place, said it was a success. #InsideEdition"

Pennywise from \"It\" is another popular costume this year. Want something positive? There's also a Mr. Rogers costume, complete with puppets. #InsideEdition"

One of planes during the shoot malfunctioned and crashed near Half Moon Bay, about\u00a09\u00a0miles from San Francisco. The single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza lost power. Miraculously, the pilot, David Lesh, and his passenger made it out alive. As the plane sunk farther into the sea, the survivors gathered anything that would float and shot video of their entire ordeal as they tread water. #InsideEdition"
