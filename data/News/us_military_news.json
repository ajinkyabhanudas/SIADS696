                "description": "The V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities.

It will replace the U.S. Air Force\u2019s aging fleet of F-16s and A-10s, which have been the primary strike fighter aircraft for more than 20 years, and bring with it an enhanced capability to survive in the advanced threat environment in which it was designed to operate. \n\nWith its aerodynamic performance and advanced integrated avionics, the F-35 Fighter Jet will provide next-generation stealth, enhanced situational awareness, and reduced vulnerability for the United States and allied nations.\n\nOther videos you might like:\nUH-60 Black Hawk \u25ba https://youtu.be/2ngzaoJtUD4\nF-35 is Now More Advanced \u25ba https://youtu.be/jwSrNAb4LgU\nFuture U.S. FIGHTER JETS  \u25ba https://youtu.be/tToLVFFv_Ow\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank You"

Production variants of the F-111 had roles that included ground attack, strategic bombing reconnaissance and electronic warfare. \nDeveloped in the 1960s by General Dynamics, the F-111 entered service in 1967 with the USAF. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) also ordered the type and began operating the F-111C variant in 1973.\n\nOther videos you might like:\nThis is America's E-6 Mercury \u25ba https://youtu.be/ZZRH-k4TUuQ\nWhy America's Enemies Feared the P-47 \u25ba https://youtu.be/bYssexVvggA\nAmerica's Crazy Flying Aircraft Carrier  \u25ba https://youtu.be/EgbgIOThb4E\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank You"

Moreover, the NSM initiates random flight maneuvers during its terminal flight phase that help the missile evade enemy countermeasures.\n\nOther videos you might like:\nThis is America's E-6 Mercury \u25ba https://youtu.be/ZZRH-k4TUuQ\nWhy America's Enemies Feared the P-47 \u25ba https://youtu.be/bYssexVvggA\nAmerica's Crazy Flying Aircraft Carrier  \u25ba https://youtu.be/EgbgIOThb4E\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank You"

Two contenders from Sikorsky-Boeing and Bell will battle it out to become the winner of the Service\u2019s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program and the Army\u2019s next combat helo when it deploys in 2030.\n\nThe Defiant X will square off against the Bell V-280 Valor for the FLRAA contract in 2022, with Army aviation units receiving their first aircraft by 2030.\n\nOther videos you might like:\nThis is America's E-6 Mercury \u25ba https://youtu.be/ZZRH-k4TUuQ\nWhy America's Enemies Feared the P-47 \u25ba https://youtu.be/bYssexVvggA\nAmerica's Crazy Flying Aircraft Carrier  \u25ba https://youtu.be/EgbgIOThb4E\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank You"

Daryl Knee, Air Combat Command Public Affairs, \"One snapshot reflection focuses on the integration of the F-15E Strike Eagle fighter aircraft as a valued contributor to the close-air-support mission set.\"\n\nBefore the development of the F-22 Raptor, the F-15 Eagle ruled the skies. It replaced the vaunted F-111 as the U.S. military\u2019s primary fighter bomber and, for much of its life, it was the fast-moving air superiority fighter, king of all air superiority fighters. In much of the world, it still rules \u2014 and there are many, many reasons why.\n\nIt Still Has It: How the F-15 Became America's Deadliest Fighter Aircraft\n\nOther videos you might like:\nThis is America's E-6 Mercury \u25ba https://youtu.be/ZZRH-k4TUuQ\nWhy America's Enemies Feared the P-47 \u25ba https://youtu.be/bYssexVvggA\nAmerica's Crazy Flying Aircraft Carrier  \u25ba https://youtu.be/EgbgIOThb4E\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank You"

While heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing gunships and bombers have been launched from aircraft carriers, it is currently not possible to land them\n\nOther videos you might like:\nThis is America's E-6 Mercury \u25ba https://youtu.be/ZZRH-k4TUuQ\nWhy America's Enemies Feared the P-47 \u25ba https://youtu.be/bYssexVvggA\nAmerica's Crazy Flying Aircraft Carrier  \u25ba https://youtu.be/EgbgIOThb4E\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank You",

                "description": "The Seawolf class is a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy. The class was the intended successor to the Los Angeles class, and design work began in 1983. A fleet of 29 submarines was to be built over a ten-year period, but that was reduced to 12 submarines. \n\nThe end of the Cold War and budget constraints led to the cancellation of any further additions to the fleet in 1995, leaving the Seawolf class limited to just three boats. This, in turn, led to the design of the smaller Virginia class. The Seawolf class cost about $3 billion per unit ($3.5 billion for USS Jimmy Carter), making it the most expensive SSN submarine and second most expensive submarine ever, after the French SSBN Triomphant class.\n\nOther videos you might like:\nThis is America's E-6 Mercury \u25ba https://youtu.be/ZZRH-k4TUuQ\nWhy America's Enemies Feared the P-47 \u25ba https://youtu.be/bYssexVvggA\nAmerica's Crazy Flying Aircraft Carrier  \u25ba https://youtu.be/EgbgIOThb4E\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank You",

                    "description": "The Seawolf class is a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy. The class was the intended successor to the Los Angeles class, and design work began in 1983. A fleet of 29 submarines was to be built over a ten-year period, but that was reduced to 12 submarines. \n\nThe end of the Cold War and budget constraints led to the cancellation of any further additions to the fleet in 1995, leaving the Seawolf class limited to just three boats. This, in turn, led to the design of the smaller Virginia class. The Seawolf class cost about $3 billion per unit ($3.5 billion for USS Jimmy Carter), making it the most expensive SSN submarine and second most expensive submarine ever, after the French SSBN Triomphant class.\n\nOther videos you might like:\nThis is America's E-6 Mercury \u25ba https://youtu.be/ZZRH-k4TUuQ\nWhy America's Enemies Feared the P-47 \u25ba https://youtu.be/bYssexVvggA\nAmerica's Crazy Flying Aircraft Carrier  \u25ba https://youtu.be/EgbgIOThb4E\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank You"

The P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane may not be as sexy as an F-35 stealth fighter, but in some ways it is far closer to the forefront of international flashpoints in the Pacific Ocean. Maritime patrol planes are essential for tracking the movement of ships and especially submarines across vast oceanic waters\u2014and potentially sinking them in the event of hostilities.\n\nHere Is Why Russia and China Fear America's P-8 Poseidon Submarine Killer\n\nOther videos you might like:\n5 Deadliest Guns on the Planet \u25ba https://youtu.be/1t0DdUyQPTU\nNothing Seems to Kill the B-52 Bomber \u25ba https://youtu.be/QHMGOl2AWpA\nNothing Seems to Beat the Virginia-class Submarines \u25ba https://youtu.be/b9zrcSCrbwk\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1"

Indeed, as Fesler notes, if an enemy aircraft has survived to enter the \u201cmerge\u201d\u2014or visual range combat\u2014and finds a Raptor, something has gone terribly wrong. That usually leads to an intensive debrief to understand what went wrong. Indeed, all of the pilots I spoke to unanimously told me that the debrief is the most important part of a training sortie. Nonetheless, F-22 pilots train extensively for a visual range fight. \u201cWe usually train full-up versus full-up,\u201d Crash said. \u201cWe assume that a Western-trained F-22 is going to be the most challenging threat we\u2019re going to go against.\u201d\n\nHere is The Real Reason Why the F-22 Raptor Can Kill Anything in the Sky\n\nOther videos you might like:\nAGM-65 Maverick Missile \u25ba https://youtu.be/H6FkyaXKJGk\nWhy America's F-22s, F-35s and B-2 Bombers can't be Stopped \u25ba https://youtu.be/z8dLQB6KVmA\nHow to Beat Russia's S-400 \u25ba https://youtu.be/LRw5nLTCCHQ\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nThank you so much for always supporting US",

                    "description": "Typically, the Blue F-22s will slaughter the enemy from long-range. Indeed, as Fesler notes, if an enemy aircraft has survived to enter the \u201cmerge\u201d\u2014or visual range combat\u2014and finds a Raptor, something has gone terribly wrong. That usually leads to an intensive debrief to understand what went wrong. Indeed, all of the pilots I spoke to unanimously told me that the debrief is the most important part of a training sortie. Nonetheless, F-22 pilots train extensively for a visual range fight. \u201cWe usually train full-up versus full-up,\u201d Crash said. \u201cWe assume that a Western-trained F-22 is going to be the most challenging threat we\u2019re going to go against.\u201d\n\nHere is The Real Reason Why the F-22 Raptor Can Kill Anything in the Sky\n\nOther videos you might like:\nAGM-65 Maverick Missile \u25ba https://youtu.be/H6FkyaXKJGk\nWhy America's F-22s, F-35s and B-2 Bombers can't be Stopped \u25ba https://youtu.be/z8dLQB6KVmA\nHow to Beat Russia's S-400 \u25ba https://youtu.be/LRw5nLTCCHQ\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nThank you so much for always supporting US"

Instead, the flying branch is upgrading the tough ground-attackers so they can fight and survive in high-intensity combat.\n\nThe Air Force had hoped to begin retiring its 281 A-10s starting in 2015. But Congress blocked the effort. Now the A-10 is safe even as the Air Force considers retiring other plane types.\n\nOther videos you might like:\nHow Powerful is AGM-65 Maverick Missile \u25ba https://youtu.be/H6FkyaXKJGk\nwhy the US Air Force Might Need More F-35s \u25ba https://youtu.be/Aj8OUiVCcB8\nHow America's F-35 Technology to Beat Russia's S-400 \u25ba https://youtu.be/LRw5nLTCCHQ\nStealth Bombers Are Amazing Weapons \u25ba https://youtu.be/I94WOV68iR4\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank you so much for always supporting US"

                    "description": "China's J-20 stealth fighter, a copycat of Lockheed Martin's F-22, reportedly could be combat ready this year, but while a J-20 vs. F-22 dogfight would be lopsided in favor of the U.S., there is an important caveat.\n\nThe \"F-22 would destroy it instantly\" with superior stealth capabilities, radar and precision weapons, Richard Aboulafia, a Teal Group aerospace consultant, said of China's stealth fighter ambitions. \n\nIn the narrow role of air superiority \u2013 beating the best fighters the other side can offer to gain control of the sky \u2013 American F-22 Raptor could most likely beat down China\u2019s J-20 without much trouble.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE TO US \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/USMilitaryNewsMN?sub_confirmation=1"

Nonetheless, it remains a potent fighter even as it likely heads toward retirement."
