Ben and Rebecca address the question of whether Russian President Vladimir Putin could ultimately use nuclear weapons as an off-ramp to the war in Ukraine. They discuss NATO, US, and Russian military strategy and history to give a detailed perspective of what the next moves could be. Plus, they look at the role China is playing as the war continues.\n\nFor more of The Ben Domenech Podcast: https://bit.ly/3SoYZkE\n\nFollow Ben on Twitter: @BDomenech\n\nSubscribe to Fox News! https://bit.ly/2vBUvAS\nWatch more Fox News Video: http://video.foxnews.com\nWatch Fox News Channel Live: http://www.foxnewsgo.com/\n\nFOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service delivering breaking news as well as political and business news.

The White House messaging on these problems has varied from blaming Republicans to blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin; however, many Americans are not yet convinced as his approval ratings fell to a record low. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer joins the Rundown to discuss why the communications strategy from the Biden administration isn\u2019t working. Fleischer also discusses his new book \"Suppression, Deception, Snobbery, and Bias,\" and the importance of holding the media accountable for their bias.\n\nMajor League Baseball player Lyman Wesley Bostock Jr. was a famous athlete whose career was cut short during his untimely murder in 1978. FOX Sports Reporter Tom Rinaldi's upcoming documentary podcast \"Wesley\" tells the story of the late California Angels player. Rinaldi joins the Rundown to discuss the life, career, and legacy of Bostock as well as his infamous murder. He also discusses why many famous names are leaving the PGA for the LIV.\n\nDon't miss the good news with Tonya J.

The White House messaging on these problems has varied from blaming Republicans to blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin; however, many Americans are not yet convinced as his approval ratings fell to a record low. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer joins the Rundown to discuss why the communications strategy from the Biden administration isn\u2019t working. Fleischer also discusses his new book \"Suppression, Deception, Snobbery, and Bias,\" and the importance of holding the media accountable for their bias.\n\nMajor League Baseball player Lyman Wesley Bostock Jr. was a famous athlete whose career was cut short during his untimely murder in 1978. FOX Sports Reporter Tom Rinaldi's upcoming documentary podcast \"Wesley\" tells the story of the late California Angels player. Rinaldi joins the Rundown to discuss the life, career, and legacy of Bostock as well as his infamous murder. He also discusses why many famous names are leaving the PGA for the LIV.\n\nDon't miss the good news with Tonya J.

They don\u2019t want grandmas helping to educate young mamas on how to raise babies. They want the federal government to certify people, get them to join a union, have them not show up for work. I mean look at what they have done to restaurants. Look at what they\u2019ve done to the retail sector. Look at what their policies are already doing and what Build Back Broke is going to bring to other areas, like childcare. It\u2019s amazing to me. It is a socialist agenda. They love the lockdowns.

I mean look at what they have done to restaurants. Look at what they\u2019ve done to the retail sector. Look at what their policies are already doing and what Build Back Broke is going to bring to other areas, like childcare. It\u2019s amazing to me. It is a socialist agenda. They love the lockdowns. They\u2019re ready to go to work for it. \n\n...\n\nFOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service delivering breaking news as well as political and business news.

                "description": "Forbes Media Chairman Steve Forbes sounds off following November hiring numbers that were significantly below expectations. #FoxNews\n\n...\n\nSTEVE FORBES: What you have is an economy that wants to move ahead but there's still artificial barriers there. Yes, we know the huge supply chain problems. Those are underestimated when you shut down a global economy, not helping that in the future. Europe is locking down again. But the fact is that lockdowns don't work. We know medically they don't work, economically they're hugely disruptive, in terms of health care they're hugely disruptive. So in terms of the economy, the administration is still waging war, for example, against the oil and gas industry. They haven't yet explained why getting a barrel of oil from Russia is somehow better for climate change than getting a barrel of oil from America. So they want Russia to produce more and we to produce less. And those kinds of mixed signals are hurting investment in the future. So if they just get out of the way, the American people would do it. One of the amazing things about this jobs report is that they have a thing called the household survey, and the employment numbers there fluctuate widely from month to month, but they do take account of small businesses. Those jobs numbers went up 1.1 million. So you have a lot of small businesses ready to go but now you have the vaccine mandate in there, which is going to hurt, especially in critical areas. So the government is the problem, not the -- and I think people fear what the government is going to do in response to this new variant more than they do the variant itself. \n\n...\n\nSubscribe to Fox News! https://bit.ly/2vBUvAS\nWatch more Fox News Video: http://video.foxnews.com\nWatch Fox News Channel Live: http://www.foxnewsgo.com/\n\nFOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service delivering breaking news as well as political and business news.

                    "description": "Forbes Media Chairman Steve Forbes sounds off following November hiring numbers that were significantly below expectations. #FoxNews\n\n...\n\nSTEVE FORBES: What you have is an economy that wants to move ahead but there's still artificial barriers there. Yes, we know the huge supply chain problems. Those are underestimated when you shut down a global economy, not helping that in the future. Europe is locking down again. But the fact is that lockdowns don't work. We know medically they don't work, economically they're hugely disruptive, in terms of health care they're hugely disruptive. So in terms of the economy, the administration is still waging war, for example, against the oil and gas industry. They haven't yet explained why getting a barrel of oil from Russia is somehow better for climate change than getting a barrel of oil from America. So they want Russia to produce more and we to produce less. And those kinds of mixed signals are hurting investment in the future. So if they just get out of the way, the American people would do it. One of the amazing things about this jobs report is that they have a thing called the household survey, and the employment numbers there fluctuate widely from month to month, but they do take account of small businesses. Those jobs numbers went up 1.1 million. So you have a lot of small businesses ready to go but now you have the vaccine mandate in there, which is going to hurt, especially in critical areas. So the government is the problem, not the -- and I think people fear what the government is going to do in response to this new variant more than they do the variant itself. \n\n...\n\nSubscribe to Fox News! https://bit.ly/2vBUvAS\nWatch more Fox News Video: http://video.foxnews.com\nWatch Fox News Channel Live: http://www.foxnewsgo.com/\n\nFOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service delivering breaking news as well as political and business news.
